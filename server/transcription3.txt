as soon as I stated our next presentation Allen Ave and needs no introduction but I'll get him one anyway he's a software engineer working for the call last currently working to make the distributive web or accessible to developers at 11 if you want to get started I will hand it over to you alright welcome to a mash-up of to talk about storing dates that long I could have been using web free tote storage and and ft storage so that's a piece of good luck today the kind of chain side of them how I can bestow decentralised on itfs and power coins and keys are missing people ought to have been around so long
I was super excited to see it already being used to store them so free sample if I had to go to the like any kind of websites like this one for instances of this is the game that uses in a few days they have like they have like a nephew that you can buy and trade and stuff so let's have a look at this one person and I happen to know that this particular game uses the marketplace of marketplace has cooled Open Sea
 open see that we go and I can just paste in the the token ID is that this particular entity hopefully I can click on it did it come out
 is it working
hello
 I have yeah there it is
 Lowell's come on internet
 no
 open sea is not having a good time at the moment all right I'll try one more time
 right anyway I can cook for you and I can see that that it's metadata is here I should just be able to click on this
 little kids text brought with with danger so we shall see how it how I get it to look like things are going to work out so well today they dis this at
say a CID on Wednesday for this particular and here it is it's just come up
 and I don't. Some nights that week but why why is AT&T stores on like a habit of the expensive just do what I said on chain on the least I'm an artificer into in a little bit realize that the enabling and a secret just so I can say for example like Foundation like silver they already had about using being able to access that they should they have it just like disappear off the face of the spices ass like you stay away like that they still won't be able to access you then if she's with a fool and I'm creating traded so didn't want the anesthesia
search answer
 Ikea Fest this this comes into play now and this this same code I just passed from my point of view at least it's not really surprising but it did get that so let me check rewind a little bit I'm an explain the basics of itss and hopefully not too much technical detail a little bit he's a little one eyed squid thing since that's all I see on Sandbox sandbox game and if you get a CID it's cool to constantly identifier to see how these are a kind of cryptographic hash in the address book content know his location that address that squid with the one I know where it is and that means any given CID will always refer to the same content so I guess that if that Squidward to grab another guy friends and Celestia
that's great but I see change and go to the OC IDs are stored on check under the link to from Giant and if that wasn't the case if we used like a regular URL satellite Google drive or like a truck box URL or whatever that could be problematic why could that be problematic look at the end of the URL could be deleted by the on the domayne could straighten curly spiral the hosting like you could be not be paid and then and then just go away they could video Whatever It Is could be altered in some way so I could have my squad turned into it let's keep cats or something which which would be disappointed that you are well just want to be accessible from within your country or maybe you're not get some sort of corporate bar what will at some place where I need to get hold of a stator from a pair that may be closer to you than the internet location where it where actually is
so i p f f how does it work anyway so if someone is using a GFS requests that they took by a CID then the person who has it and get back to you and then receive it
 newest Avett so I'm out to notes have that same continent of it to anyone else who comes along so it's like 30 and the nurse can help to transfer the bikes to that to that night we called it a b walking because I said it happens now free of them have it and the cool thing about this is that the original no way I will still be retrievable awesome power of the first one is the Nerds
go away then you're going to have to retreat it's kind of obvious there's no one on the internet who has the content you're not going to be able to get the concert
 that's how we are number one number two is slightly less is garbage collection I said depending on your ticket how much EC configuration it might be on a particular time it might want round when you're at figured repo storage limit is hit so you might be fixing things are like it's a still goes into a repo and then eventually he'll use enough data that I guess that's okay okay you're wet what kind of stole now let's have let's do it she see you around so you can invite TC from the command line or you can if you go to the HTTP API expose you can call it from
 we need to do till I get this content is not garbage
because when you obtained consent from the network that you didn't actually ask yourself that content is eligible for garbage collection so if I got this picture but squared from someone else it could be garbage collection in the future so we need to do is going to tell you I confess that this piece of content is in artifice box refer to as pending and if you don't poop in your diaper than it will eventually be garbage collected so even if it is super popular you still eventually exit the network has at least two cups of y-linked store that content because they have knows that the publicly available and they stay online like 24/7 and always say that pin the contents it doesn't disappear
 so and if they do storage
money just mentioned this earlier so you kind of already know a little bit about it it's it's coming through everything with me for a while now it's a place where you can store your nft deitch decentralize on ipfs and park when they say they'll be there tomorrow because some way to addressing the permanents problem and it's free it's free as long as long as we can possibly make it free I'm the one of the founding kind of pencil Google's is it should be easy to do what I say using this service
 so how does it work will you live here in a few days it to NFC those storage and if you do storage stores that they to on ipfs nodes in the mail run free free nuggets at least so far so good but how's that different from any other like painting sets what kind of scenes when he goes to work she's doing is his negotiating deals to store your data storage providers on the file coin
no incentivizes the storage device to store data quite get paid to still get paid when they fighting costume at work
 so why why is that good well if and if you do stories we just happen to just go away like it's gone then every night on the network went away as well then I'm going to storage with why does he have to content will still happen to still have it and they will store it for the duration of the nicest thing you can think of a storage providers it's just another set if I confessed his with really strong incentives to cancel continue store in that data this is this is a really good level of redundancy
 so I'm here.
decentralized storage vanity is online TF Oakland and storage excited about a thousand projects go take it we have to be like yeah it's expressed as an open API scheme if you don't want that means that means we can generate looks like this week at generate but actually generate clients from this scheme, which is Conrad in different languages the API is real smooth you probably going to need even smaller subset of it like these two like if you want to upload a file to upload but what I really want to switch orientation to hear is this some this check ASAP I check the status of any the c i d e n e a n f t that's been already 10 ft storage and the outputs of that, looks like this and so you can see it like the beginning stages of this particular CID but also the
use with Falcon storage providers that have been made or are being mad he's currently until you see that stay just like time take stamps when things have happened change at the Unchained Eli tea so I can go pick it up and see the the address of the storage provider his he's storing it was going to be storing it and was interesting was reading something here is this true things this time it's the patch root CID Andrew said that they tomorrow selection that that is kind of important ones because what happens is that I've dated comes into and if you do Cerita gets kind of aggravated together into this big Peppa Pig pilot states are not get that got sent to the minors and then if you ever want to get your piece of data out is that big then you're going to need the day tomorrow selection allows you to pinpoint your taking a bit within with within the aggregate
 this is this is cool maybe I did you can you can use to check stuff
they have the same thing in with Frito storage was going to talk about in a sec
 JS cuz we have an official JavaScript this one isn't generated from open API with lovingly handcrafted this one for API as well and this message ASAP is designed to make a meeting and a t r e e z for you by guiding you for creating like erc721 1155 compatible and we will take a look at that take a look at that now so let's see how it goes
 that my goats are on
 hopefully going to help me out here he would get his old hole.
 Okay I'm so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this
API Radiance told the client from an estate of storage using npm on M-14 right there so I just created a website two states in the mid-90s what I'm going to do with this
 open pie cuz it's appropriate about pending and stuff so just trying to do Abyss using the messages right you are so what I need to do is Cool Clyde the store and then we give it an object that looks similar to something that you'd get in when you click through from your taking URI which has been to don't rent on chain to where the actual
850 video Whatever It Is can be somewhat a country but it looks like it's pretty simple it looks something like this cuz it's a comic thing and then what kind of cool here is that we took Daisy the properties code image and it has to be essentially the URL to an image where you will NFP which is your entity essentially what we put in here is actually just file and what happens behind the scenes is the the end of Steel storage plant will automatically upload that image for you and replace that image with a u r u r a l to the the artifice assets which is stored on I-10 that so it's just cookie do that if I was going to use FS to refile saying
get the pin by jpeg
 get to get a phone number to be different from the actual phone with reading Franz just keep it in mind type / so we do this return to promise so I need to wait on it and I get back the subject
 picture of Jacks and them still log out
 the message that thoughts
 are you around this is the this is the URL that you like to use in your mental process that would be stored on chain
 log message to I'm just going to print out the data here just to show you this file gets transformed into a URL to this particular Act
that's what I need to do so we will see if this works
 dormant
 I'm in the Bronx directory
 okay sorry about that
 but Siri does suck
 so yeah it's imprinted that this looks out the URLs is the URL that we're going to put in on Chene and also it is the data and you can see this image transformed into your as well so that's super cool
 k m and what I should just be able to do is head on back over at 2 to hear if I could this into my browser
yes there we could I should just be able to stitch it from neitsch Gateway and this is detective that I uploaded to a super cool that's not done I have successfully done that Sharon
 let's get back to tonight's kids slides
 here we go we actually uploaded data and then we go back and see her ID from in a feet of storage and anything else is doing the work cuz I'm generating CID from the day so that we sent it as a couple of problems with that first thing we have to trust enough to do so we just doing the right thing is not giving us the CID give some malicious virus in some way
I'm so blessed to have generated up CID ourselves that we have to wait for that CID to come back to us we have to upload that day too and we could I see if you did come back when actually it would be really useful to have that CID before we uploaded because then we could mint Serenity on change Wallace's uploading and if it's something big that might take a while to upload so she having a party generation on the client side before I get some by Des'ree useful because then I can use it somewhere else I can maybe you can store it in the database in my in my eye for whatever
 I'm so so it means that I can I don't have to trust and if you have to worry and I also get to get the solstice ux issue is Lady midnight
new is storing car because I'm not automobiles in this world because our content addressable archives is kind of like tar for tags tags add Red Cross and they are the things that the ipfs generates when you import data to it so got topped off with bags if that's a good thing to know. CID before my flight land in the clients that works at the one on this side we can do the kitchen right. C i d means assembling that day Teresa's across the family have that CD I didn't have that root root file but once we have the cross we pack it into a car that's in the car instead there's the thing that you I did because you generate the CID on the front side so there we go
 and it was something so we can split it up into multiple car so I can send you can send partial
awesome. Looks like bits of that I'm at school because if you don't like a load today so I can so I can smoke a bit more than one connect box of the services that we decided to put it on but car flat workers and they are cool cuz they put your choice to be requesting that a p.o. box that you have a limit on like how much states in you can send them again but it's okay because we can jump up things so we don't have to you don't have to abide by this hundred making my road anymore
 so you typically end of the drive diagram you might end up like some yellow line rings around the notes in the garage that you maybe be sending in one car so you might send this set of knives in one car you might send this set an another car and he might send this in the third car and we know that all of these cars are related to the
the same routes CID
 unspeakable allows like spadea and retry without sending everything again we could just send any any car in any order what's a report on progress I'll finish sending a chunk so we can say
 alright let's try a real quick storing the car then I feel like this guy way of at I'm sorry all right so I can go
 let's share my whole screen
 great so this is very similar to what we had before I got to I've imported this extra artifice, to this going to help us a car from the puff I'm going to use a 70s pimp I again
the content is actually so that's just the phone I simply read read the file
 and by the way I'm not going to eat at 2 because I want to demonstrate it is that true skate movie is 24 MB is just it's just make sure
 his my skating movie is 24 MB that's right I wish you could see I'm free chunks at 2:10 exercise and one.
 Gate movie
 and the cool thing is at this point here with
the saddest video into a car file and we also got the CID before we even sent it to a client so we can we can call the CID here on weekends when we get the receipt to return from the client we can verify that the CID we created is a CID that has been returned to the car and the cool thing is it that we caught this nice cool back which is a side the size of the chunks it was the car chunk it was stowed so we can walk out
 we can walk out the how many pints is Stuart chunks that get sent
 that's a good to go
 through what I'm still at CID likes
straight away and so now what's happening is a little bit that live in one chunk about that's like for mac and so these other two his attend make chunk to come through and then what time egg-free chunks in parallel with send out the free in parallel to stop browser that stuff about it and the full MB chunks even though it was maybe at the end of the day so it wasn't cuz the idea that we that we we calculated
 that's pretty cool
 back to slides all right we are getting on for finishing up but
 at this point I've talked to the whole lot about in a sheet of three spots with Frito storage is the brand new thing is just
Frito storage is still any days. So it's not just a Nifty York's you remember this slide from earlier than when Fritos zactly the same thing so it's not just for
 so you can put two images you can put documents whatever you like even as well
 so you can pick what works for you the best so if you're going to be missing a piece and you're going to want to go with an AT&T that's the way it gives you the tools that you sold to create and store after you missed that message will comply to if you're in standards it was supposed best practices for Lincoln today to school to my BFF and then you should at check that difference right now
B into the whip Credo storage Clint with Manny this is a nice nice chest time we talked with free to soar as well will catch up to you in a few days to respond at some point but the moment you can see the storing files at least you just cool like client and then it does it does not mention cause he like it's just it just does that for you it will create the sack it was split the car update upload do we trying if it should fail for a pretty simple 6 so hopefully I even easier than 10 ft of storage
 all right so that's pretty quickly. It's not to text you this is the storage in the future and a Civil Service employee the back end to end it might be well for you to see how that goes they are very similar and say what happens is that uses sedation
call files we put stuff into r i p f s class. We have everything to do not provide any Services as you come across a sad story because I was just the way it would be interesting stuff patents basically and what what it does is it grabbed hold of the CID still my database and advise we purchase them up into a present so then I sent you lick my nuts and the presents are RC cars well everything is done and what happens is that storage providers they come and eat them up, eat them but they will take them because it's a self-serve kind of thing like it and can you give me the details and I
okay
 lost lost it a free when we when we say free we often get questions like why do like how is that possible let me let me tell you a little bit about how is essentially a bit in the bottom right-hand corner of this is one of the storage provider who has them out there anyway so what happens is that storage space to the park with network they can I get like significant block roads are not circular thing that happens at 6 at the V progresses they get they got rules on this translates into real well prophets prophesy down Haiti's money and that means that they really like incentive eyes to keep Tennessee
additional hard disc after doing that just so they can provide is a storing data from uses on the network that likelihood of winning the award goes up by big fat test and x-ray stuff so you can see the potential profits to be made by storing real user data this is such a powerful incentive to call Gwen Stewart tits tour dates such as they said that it's coming from a friend at storage I'm cool and if you do Story 3 story mode of multiple and some cases I'm going to snow next Saturday the 19th pay that uses its
 Aziz block rules continue to be really powerful incentive which will be
true for a long time and for some food like Bitcoin block reward still at an incentive to bitcoin miners today storage should be free for verify Jesus on the Falcon Network right now and see if it's free for us to get spray for you sister if you want to learn more about the the mechanics behind that I'm at how to be a verified use it then if you go to the Falkland docks and then I click on this it's doubling that plus it's talks about going to II and then and you can you can find out how to do it and that is mostly all I have to say thank you so much for listening and I hope you have no teeth
