Dietary Approaches to Treating Multiple Sclerosis-Related Fatigue with Terry Wahls, MD

morning everybody or anybody watching on Livestream welcome we're at the Celia Scott Weatherhead Center for functional medicine is our first Grand rounds in our new center so welcome and we're privileged today to have an extraordinary physician and thinker and L in functional medicine dr. Terry Wahls was formerly at the VA who was running the therapeutic lifestyle clinic for Ms patients with great success and is involved in doing clinical research showing how a diet and lifestyle can actually reverse greatly improve multiple sclerosis which is here to for something we've never seen without medication
 and she was actually an MS patient with progressive MS and was in a wheelchair for 4 years could not sit up could barely feed herself could barely function and discovered functional medicine and diet changes
4 South and now is walking functioning riding her bike and actually actively growing her career and building a new center call the wells Institute which will further progress for research who's the author of The Wahls Protocol which is how I be progressive MS with paleo principles and functional medicine so I'm really pleased to welcome her in and her own story is quite extraordinary here in a minute but she discovered that many of her symptoms and her Ms was due to a trigger which was a life-long load of toxins starting with chemicals and pains like Mercury cadmean lead in her undergraduate degree in Fine Arts and in medical school with formaldehyde in my neighbor hobbies and growing up on a farm in Iowa highly exposed to act resine and other toxic pesticides all of which accumulated to lead to her Ms so with that I welcome dr.
Terry Wallace thank you for joining us today
 expectation
 okay
 so let me get my clicker here and just say that I'm sitting out snap cuz of the MS it's because I've had the privilege of getting spinal stenosis along with journey as well so standing for long time gets to be a problem so we'll just go ahead and do the city
 so here are the objectives I'm going to go past those of them say I did take the time to write out to write a subject as for you my disclosures I have a grant funding direct a charity I now also have funding from the national MS Society and had in-kind funding from DJ open up the light easy press for our first study copyrights to a couple of bucks Trade Mart the Wahls diet plans the Wahls Protocol and a couple of
copies that I bound and now also other Wallace Institute
 so let me go back to my story in 2009 became impatient and at that time I developed a weakness in my left leg position once you're my chart and saw that 13 years earlier I complained of dimness in my left eye when I was out rollerblading on a hot day getting ready for my birkebeiner which is a 55 speak louder out race in northern Wisconsin ice on my parade in my spinal cord and it's all lesions at the Circle cord C1 C2 pyramidion Ms was made and they suggested that I get a second opinion
recommend to the Cleveland Clinic and so I'll come back here I came to get the confirmatory diagnosis of relapsing-remitting Ms know at that time
 I knew that having a message from a big deal it's a progressive illness and when you think of the the downstream cost of having a mess it's a very big deal because the vast majority of folks will ultimately convert into secondary progressive MS and the cost is very high both to society and the individual. This is from a study done in Poland and it was published in 2013 the cost was 40,000 to 7 $2,000 a year for drug cost a lot and that's on top of that there's an annual Andre r i Physical Therapy occupational therapy
office visits and as I said within 10 years of diagnose 1/2 will convert to secondary Progressive 1/2 will be unable to work due to severe fatigue and one-third of problems with gate disability
 and this is a big impact on the family because you're going to have lost income from the person who has the MS diagnosis you'll have the MS is the leading cause of disability here in the US in terms of leaving the workforce early caregiving cost for up from strangers for the percent become progressively more stable and there is the caregiving cost from the family members who have lost income as they have to provide I cares to that individual with Ms. You're much more likely to have early and sustained
and then there is the ms-related pain which before the onset of gabapentin and Lyrica was very very difficult to treat in fact Ms was the leading cause or the leading diagnosis for all those people who requested assisted suicide with dr. Kevorkian for that because I was a big part of my Ms diagnosis
 so as I mentioned earlier I was referred to the Cleveland Clinic and I got Mike are here for the first three years I've seen a doctor Stone over at the Mellen Center
 and despite taking newest drugs still within three years of diagnosis my disease had converted and I had a secondary progressive MS and was started by the Sandra and I had a lot of
torso muscles it was getting more and more difficult to set up I know it was having more difficulty with fatigue
 nail since 2003 I did the North norcom North American Research committee on Ms quality of life survey that I've just taken a couple of questions out of that which was rate your MS symptoms were they better somewhat better no different somewhat worse worse or dramatically worse every 6 months that same at my symptoms were worse and my fatigue when I first completed the survey with mild but I think my first year here is 2005 it's moderate severe as total which means the fatigue was impacting every aspect of my life
 so by the summer of 2007 so June
I'm so weak in the Torso I cannot sit up in a regular chair
 so I couldn't see it. I couldn't sit in the chair is that you're sitting here now at a zero gravity chair like this one at home one in my office another in the Clipper area where I saw patients with residents and when I ate I was in that zero gravity chair
 Star Wars more upright but I was still had to recline far back was my family's pretty nervous about how well I can protect my Airway I'm also at this time I'll lose my keys losing my phone that summer at lost my phone three times I lost my smart Keys twice
 and my chief of staff in July I called me in to say we're going to assign you to the traumatic brain injury Clinic, the middle of January will be seeing patients with the Physical Medicine rehab.
can the psychiatrist and you won't have residents now I get home to tell my wife she knew that and I knew that was a job I couldn't physically do and so this was really the VA and the universe's way of saying you know what design your job for you for quite a few years now but it's time we're ever going to force your hand to have to take the medical disability
 I was depressed it was not a good time
 and so I'm going to give you a quick timeline of my illness during medical school in the 1980s I began to have his electrical twinges of discomfort at first and I could tell that it's more like to have this trouble when I was being yelled at by my attendance and the episodes and then they would fade away
and I can also tell overtime the intensity and frequency of these episodes should be a bit more frequent and a bit more intense 87 I completed my residency I was in private practice up at the Marshfield Clinic and of course at that time in my life I was doing the marathon's long-distance bike ride so I did the 55 km every winter and so I was training on a lovely Hot August day and I had a 10 miles out and I realized I could see out of my left eye so I took my skis I walked back by the time I got back I could see again had a big work up and they really weren't sure what it was I said just don't ski in really hot
okay and if I did I could see out of my left eye so I backed off and my training
 then the episodes of my face paint continue to get a little bit worse a little bit more difficult I finally did see back to neurologist was treated with Gabapentin gabapentin with Tegretol about the drug rash had to stop at and there was no drug therapy I just going to tough it out eventually I would back to see neurology with the pain clinic and got an injection and then we'll start on gabapentin which I used episodically become more frequent more severe and then in 2000 I developed a weakness in my left leg and that's when I was diagnosed and start on Copaxone
 down here at the Cleveland Clinic dr. Stone mention the work of Ashton Ambry and a group called direct a charity and threw them by discover
Loren cordain and the paleo diet so after 20 years of being a vegetarian which really annoyed my parents were farmers I went back to eating meat but continued to decline not I should tell you I gave up all grain all the goons all Dairy so is a big change I stayed with her because it's like I'm doing something and I realize that you do is bite take a long time to see any benefits but I was continue to decline and the following year I'd use it till we find wheelchair 2003 start novantrone 2004 and like I got to start reading this and I begin by reading about various vitamins and supplements I decide that mitochondria are the Big Driver and was causing a brain atrophy with causing progressive MS and so I'm beginning to read and search what are the the vitamins nutrients and stuff
so I can use to support my mitochondria so that in creatine creatine 27qb vitamins and after a few months I thought
 I'm wasting my money
 I'm wasting my money I quit taking the vitamins
 I can't get out of bed
 and 3 days later he comes in and says you know again I take some and I can get up and go to work
 and that was really excited and makes you really curious so a couple of weeks later I try it again I stopped all my vitamins and I'm exhausted I cannot go to work the next day so this is just wonderfully exciting news for accelerating at really motivates me to continue to read the science and do this little salt experimentation so I can stop casting ideas
is I've taken would have been a very fast and I've slowed it made it more gradual and I'm very grateful but
 so I've taken size average for several cycles that gets pulled in the market I get switched over to CellCept and other form of immune suppressants which by the way I give you oral ulcers leaves your skin sort of silvery good but because I don't have become demented and bedridden find my own has I'm happy to take that salsa
 end of the summer 2007 I discovered cuz I'm bored reviewing pay for reviewing studies doctor with shields that is using electrical stimulation of muscles in the setting of new acute traumatic injury to the spinal cord and it's doing that to maintain muscle strength in one leg and letting
become weak and he's asking to extend that study for another two years and I think he could this help me out with a mess so I do it doesn't take that long to return and 12 abstracts most of them are not relevant or a few papers with stroke injuries that occurred five years earlier had been helped and a few papers with cerebral palsy nothing with IMS so I then start searching for Easton devices and I'm ready to order my own my wife says no no no you to call physical therapist to you'll see if it's a fair person
 we have some conversation and he says well we could do this we could do this Tim you could maybe grow more muscles for your legs but I don't know
for sure that your brain could talk to those muscles we could be making additional 225 lb weights on your legs that you can't use and making walking even more difficult
 but with some more debate he agrees to let me have a test session he also says it's probably going to hurt you a lot of pain but we let me try this it hurts it hurts like hell but we do 20 minute session to my purse finest on my back on the left on the right then we do my quads 20-minute workout and by the way at that point I can only do about a 10-minute workout on the mat if I did 12 minutes I was too exhausted and could not work so I just dramatically increased my workout time already and I felt great
 at the end of the workout not do it at the end and so they told me this was probably release the endorphins
agreed that I could have sessions and so I came to the clinic three times a week for the next two weeks and trained tolerate it well and he then decided that I could begin training at home he arranged for you to get a home device to my belly and my back why did my 10-minute workout
 backed up a little bit cuz during the same time where I was discovering the e-stim I discovered this organization called The Institute for functional medicine they had a course on your protection which I ordered and I taught it so it's a lovely notebook of cases and audio sync sync power points with lectures that talked a lot about mitochondria so I was really fired up and I had too much longer list of vitamins and supplements that I now at it so I was I was now up the 20 things and so I was doing the Easter I had this long list of vitamins and supplements there was no dramatic difference
and I was doing all of this
 because I knew that for that progressive MS does not recover that I was doing all this in attempt to try and slow my declined even further if you're able to walk the small amount of walking I could do for a few more months
 in December in november-december I'd like to know if I should take this list of nutrients and get them for my food I am so I'm reading redesigning my food but like where do I get these 20 nutrients of the food supply so I go to my dietitian friends they don't really know I go to the College of Medicine Health Science Library they can't really help you out but the University of Google does and so by the end of December I've got this new food group so I should be stressing and still following the paleo diet but I redesign my diet into
will also become the Wahls Protocol and we'll get to that
 and that is when the magic begins
 so in my medicines with seeing this decline in this amazing recovery said this is so important you need to write a case report out of data case report so this is my tree neurologist Tree in physical therapist and Doctor Shields who is doing the e-stim she brought this up I'm going to call me back at and we got that now what I need to have you do is write a little research protocol we have you test this in other people with progressive MS
 so this is a visual image of what it looks like
 12 months
 in 2007 can't setup I'm using a wheelchair
12 months of the diet and I did the diet exercise estem and I went back to doing the daily meditation it's almost later I'm able to do a 20-mile bike ride with my family supports that really changes how I think about disease and how it would change how I practice medicine
 it is so that really shifted my focus and actually now turns out to be more or less I'm at the traumatic brain injury Clinic because I'm really focused on teaching these folks at there's a whole lot that you can do if we focus on diet and lifestyle to restore the function of your brain
 I ever talked to our patients a lot about mitochondria talk about brain talk about neurorestoration talk about neural regeneration
 and this comes down to thinking if we look at diet diets would it impact I think so too to make
Avenues of approach has its impact on human cells
 that is us and the other is the impact on our microbiota that is a bacterial and yeast and parasites single cellular organisms that live within us
 so I didn't it's going to give you some just a few references I can go on for weeks about all of this but this is just some of the teacher on casein protein and dairy and gluten one of the proteins and Grain in Ms in schizophrenia so liquid cow milk but not cheese is associated with higher rates of Ms across I think 27 countries and 29 different populations
 add antibodies to casein and gluten were more prevalent in recent on
adult long-term diagnosis of schizophrenia
 and there's also another paper today I did not include in here that makes the same observation casein and gluten increase the risk of Parkinson's
 no that's good so foods are excluded Casey and I was so dairy products and gluten grain products now mind you I've been paleo for quite a while that was not enough so excluding that had not been enough to recover but it was not until I reorganized my diet so what did I add if I paid a lot more attention to what I needed to add to make sure I was maximize nutrition for my brain in my mitochondria Bruce group I'm in on our sofa rich foods in a very specific with the Cabbage family onion family and must
family
 and just why so mushrooms mushrooms increase nerve growth factors and these are in some lab studies lion's mane mushrooms
 are they also activate natural killer cells they will Prime innate and adaptive immunity what does great thing for immune cell function and does great thing for nerve cell factor and bdnf
 Brassica which is the Cabbage family and onions improve your detoxification enzymes increase intracellular glutathione production will increase gamma-aminobutyric acid production your neural inhibitors for the brain so it's increasing your neuroprotection it improves and if you do function particularly the onion garlic family so again accident stuff
for brain and this will improve our ability to process eliminate all of those toxins that Mark told you that I'd had likely stored in my fat and contributing to my decline
 leafy greens why why I was I so keen on leafy greens so greens are great source of vitamin K1 which in your gut bacteria
 will metabolize to K2 mk-7 in your ribs or Liam
 lk2 is really important to the production of Milan and Kay to is also important in the effects of calcium from your walls in your heart valves are found a lot of vitamin D you will deposit calcium into the end of helium and the
heart valves if you have a lot of K2 you'll take it out of the end of helium out of the heart valves and into your teeth and your balls
 and you'll make more Mile and plus if you have a lot of greens are going to have a lot of crap noids and magnesium
 colored Foods in a particular flublok a really good for you but you want all of the colors
 and I'll pigments are a great marker for on the polyphenol antioxidants that are great for resuscitating again your mitochondria in quenching a free radicals but your Edition blue purple black
 are associated with improved outcomes for in terms of cognitive decline in their protection
 here's a couple of papers that looked at Blueberry powder versus Plus
people had early dementia or mild to moderate kind of Klein and there is improved performance in the placebo group versus the control group and the amount one cup of fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries
 so pretty easy to achieve from a dietary standpoint
 so the target if they'll say I've had probably considerably more than this three cups of greens three cups of deeply pigmented three cups of the sulfur which category about 6 ft tall in my VA Clinic most likely has probably had me 12 to 15 cups of vegetables everyday
 lots and lots of vegetables which I did not do as a pay lower uterus is more meat some vegetables so much more appreciative of Oregon
tell my grip on the farm we had Liberty onions every Friday if I graduated where you got a second serving it my my parents don't follow the rules
 no free industrially
 Oregon was what you ate because you didn't waste any of the animal and a third of the animal when it's slaughtered that would be classified as Oregon me
 it's an excellent source of the organ meat is a great source of enzyme Q minerals essential fatty Central fatty acids vitamins and water cycle vitamins
 take me to the bacterial when you eat greens will make it into K2 mk-7 and you will stored in your liver as K2 MK4 so live is a good source of vitamin K2
made by me or retinol
 vitamin A in Greens and vegetables in Orange vegetables is beta carotene which you'll have to convert into retinal please it's more likely that your enzymes at converted or less effective
 so this is just a little chart that lets you know that organ meat is a superfood I'm sort of illustrating that 100 G of kale versus Turkey versus liver versus heart is a security source of minerals
 and here is the true source of the fat-soluble and the water cycle vitamins
 so grass-fed meat Oregon beat wild fish at this point as like if it wasn't organic I wasn't going to eat it and if it wasn't organic did I really have live
twice a week
 intermittent fasting I tell restriction dietary restriction the longer the more time we spend without consuming Tower he's the better for mitochondria I am so I would intermittently go at least 16 hours in case like 24 hours and occasionally three days without eating food intentionally to lengthen that tie up for write a conch without food increases the number and increases the efficiency of the mitochondria
 it also by the way increases nerve growth factors
 so let's talk a little bit about the other thing that food does it seems my microbiota
 so there is emerging evidence that the microbiome is has a role in Ms from Japan that looked at 20 patients with MS and I think
controls and they saw that there was a depletion of Equestria species that is involved in the Burgatory th17 cells so
 if you have a mouse is part of stew to altered microbiota small steady suggestive but certainly supports my theory that the microbiome is a major player in Ms
 this is a another paper again that looked at the microbiota with Ms people who don't have MS and they look to add a disease severity who has a mouse who does not have a mess and were they having a flare of their symptoms
 so this is just a look at how well we are feeding our microbiologist
average American westernized is 15 G of fiber in the US government Target is a day if you follow the diet we've analyzed this and we see that you're using recipes and a week's worth of menus and in our said if we can get up to 80 g
 if you are lies hunter-gatherer societies 3D 200 250 g a day
 how much should you feed your microbiota a lot more than you are now the prettiest fairy answer
 so we're very fond of fermented foods at so we can we teach people how to make kombucha to make fermented cabbage kimchi recipe
 I will talk a lot about poop you want to poop you want to poop everyday if you're not pooping
do you need more fiber
 it was we talked about chia pudding flexi puddings resistant starch plantain flower green banana flour
 if you're pooping diarrhea soft putting stools you need to back off and you may need to eliminate the raw foods that have only cooked Foods until that week off
 so in our clinical trial these are the interventions that we used
 it'll tell you it was a quite an ordeal to get the proof we had to go it was a challenge that now the part of the reason why are we going to prove is that I was a member of the IRB has seen my Decline and then my recovery I am so they were very interested in improving the study but gave us the Restriction that he need to do what you did and let me see it as closely as you can
and so this is what I did the modified paleo diet Target vitamins and supplements for bass meditation so we do that we taught them how to do a simple self massage we gave them a home exercise program that targeted muscles of walking and we taught them how to do Easter
 the study diet
 9 cups of vegetables supposed to Target and if you were Petit register that you couldn't get your 9-cup since we didn't want people to overeat or over-consume
 then we excluded gluten dairy free also excluded eggs that's the third most common and because I had to exclude eggs cuz my own food sensitivity what I did
 to make the diet more tolerable will it people have to gluten-free starches per week so that's too small pieces
gluten free bread for a week or a half cup of rice
 twice in a week
 soap mostly vegetables and meat we talked about the importance of stopping sugar processed foods gluten dairy and eggs
 and the targeted vitamins were methyl B12 methylfolate vitamin D with a target of getting the vitamin D between 50 and 100 and a g in fish oil
 we taught them Mantra bass meditation we taught them how to do self massage
 we taught them a stretching exercise program for the Gas Rocks the quads the hamstrings in the back directors finest
 I would ever gave them an exercise program targeting the same muscle groups
 in order to be in the study they had to tolerate Eastham
 not everyone did
 because he still hurts and for some people it's too
activating for the narrow path of pain and I just couldn't do it so they could be in the study where we gave them food locks and they had to follow the diet a hundred percent for 7 days straight and they couldn't do that they cannot be in the study and so we we had a 25% of our folks could not make it through that two weeks running. We did become much more clear and what our expectations were high and so we got so that we had much greater success at people be able to enroll and make it through that run-in study
 the other thing that we had to do with we had to show that for safety money to do 20
 we were able to enroll 10 and show that people could implement it was safe. It's we got the 10 folks in
and then show that 58 of them and roll the next 10 so we have 20 data that were in the show here
 people were between cane and Walker
 and the average age was 51.52 score goes from 7:12 to take in every aspect of your life
 our biggest side effect was if you were overweight you lost weight without being hungry
 do people have skin burns to be instructed on how to properly do the Bastille
 thought we rise we change with the 8th like most Americans ate a lot of grain and few vegetables my public health folks say if they can get someone to increase their intake of vegetables buy 1 seriya day at the end of 12 months that's a homerun
 we had this tomorrow
change 1.5 to think almost eight servings a day and dad is a stunning level of success with a change of diet
 this is the change volume of Life the green and blue bars improve quality of life improved energy levels the red bars is declined to take severity scale score a two-point 3/8 and 0005 now mind you when you have only twenty no one expect you to have the testicle significance so again very gratifying. That we did so well here
 the factors associated with greater success if you have less disability shorter disease duration if you able to do more of the stuff that we asked no surprise if the family with you you're much more successful if you did the diet and what else
it was a big struggle
 add more exercise to do the better the impact on the gate or maybe you're getting better so you can do more exercise it's hard to know
 we have a study that would do it now thank you guys here for just a fatigued we're recruiting Jesse within 500 Mi of Iowa study at uiowa Health Care. Uiowa.edu
 I did this for the VA for 3 years. People with a wide variety of diseases
 we do this with group classes we had a teaching pictures I taught people in the group how to do a timeline The Matrix
 and then we had the dietitians in a group teach them how to cook and make the food same kind of diet
 we had very basic Primary Care Labs that we
that we monitored and very very basic interventions that we use
 and remarkable improvements in five metric outcomes are remarkable improvements across many disease States
 this is the best part we're going to show you some of the changes from our study and this is secondary progressive MS it takes her 121 starts a video please it takes a hundred twenty-seven seconds to get up walk a seat turn around and come down we're so concerned about her ability to walk we Chase it with a chair if you watch her feet you see that has difficulty between her toes up Dad or toes to go to gets stuck on the floor as she walks when start the other video
 so did you start the other video so what you see is about 12 months
chicken arise which are much more easily she can she can swing her like forward to pick up her toes dorsiflex much more effectively she's not able to do a little walk in the neighborhood she's far more independent she's able to climb stairs now for the first time she thinks in about 6 years which means she can visit friends extended family and can get out of the house if a tick by the way it's gone for what 5.6 down to 4.4 so big in fact on fatigue
 what about the slide here and fatigue is her biggest issue for fatigue score is 6.7 she uses two of the two walking sticks and go ahead start the next line
 three months she's able to walk without the cane for fatigue is markedly reduced
I get primary progressive MS there's no known treatment snow FDA-approved treatment people just go downhill either very very rapidly or somewhat more slowly and next start this one this lady was working a part-time fatigue is a major issue for her she uses a cane for short distances and a walker for long distances her son is living with her she's decided that she cannot live independently so when he finishes her his graduate degree she's going to go move into assisted living
 but start now after 3 months she can do this
 now that Kate looks normal to me my physical therapy friends tell me that they can tell it's still not quite normal every Teague has dropped from 5.3 to 1.4
 really quite quite quite remarkable
 about time
so it's as you sit in the chair you stand up walk 8 ft turned around come back and sit down in the chair
 so this time from the time up going back
 and then here she is
 and she can now jump
 a man should also do the specific activity
 did I really like that so I'm going to watch it twice
 so at the end of three years this is lady who would she enrolled with us struggle to drive 15 minutes
 her granddaughter had been born and lives 4 hours away so she's able to drive to go see your granddaughter 4 hours away without any problem and her son is move 6 hours away if you can drive to see your son without a problem
never really got into drugs she doesn't Josh she does do Pilates dose to weight training it's only feels like she's got her life back
 so the key thing I want I want all of you to take from this message today is this in their inventions that we use work across multiple disease States the modifiable lifestyle factors that was my tool kit I had a very basic Primary Care testing in my Clinic diet and lifestyle with expectation if you go to work with me you have to commit to doing the diet and lifestyle recommendations a hundred percent for 100 days and we had favorable impact across many diseases on fatigue mood and cognition
 the best steps get rid of sugar and get rid of processed foods
 eat vegetables lots of them
and I think this is my last slide and so we'll stop here and take questions
 thank you dr. Weil and nutrition facts
 Eminem to start with the first question cuz I think it's something you missed and your story that's critical which is how you deliver the program in a way that is inexpensive scalable and effective classes so the first class is at an introductory class where I tell my story describe the tenets of functional medicine and the intervention so gluten-free dairy-free and 9 cups of vegetables and that that's step number one then we'll talk about meditation exercise in addition
 and give people the option select
too hard I'll just stay with primary care or I am ready to do this on a percent and I'll come work with me in the group classes or I want to ease into this to call that go slow. They'll go work with a dietitian individually to the group class if they come to the group class their next visit is a farm is a 2 hours with Mae where we do a timeline and a matrix and I take it to a group I usually about 8 bucks and they're due and I teach them how to do their timeline how do their Matrix and I'll review their modifiable lifestyle factors what to do with her diet stress-reduction exercise social networks
 I'm in men are identified for them what are their highest-level points and what were likely the environmental factors that led to their organ system dysfunction
 then I hand that group
two are dieticians who run a cooking class and we give them cooked greens we give them a green smoothie and help them reimagine their relationship to food
 so that's like 4 hours then they come in every 6 to 8 weeks for what I think it was like a model sort of a recession that is run with me in the dietitian we have a 15 to 20-minute educational component labs
 then we kind of how many people we have in the room which might be a 215 and we divide up the time and so everybody gets a check in say like high and tri walls k150 today is 22 I found a gluten-free dairy-free 100% my big struggle is one of my grandkids, I get them traits and ate the whole bag before they get there and then I'm
so help me figure out what to do with my grandkids come back and we will seem to help is that Purity pure coaching about how you deal with family that doesn't want to buy it or grandkids whatever the challenges
 those you can come see us for a year
 then you graduate and then you're done the other thing you can see is forever is the skills class in the skills class people come in again we have a 15 minutes Q&A session and then we teach skills and the skills might range from what I call the resilience factors what is your life mission what is your purpose to me if you don't listen to movement Tai Chi Yoga strength training to cooking more cooking classes and I try to surprise the most popular class
was the resilience fact is the resilience Factor classes have you do with life purpose of life meaning for the physician for one of my visits with a dietitian for this is done in a group model overtime with profound results and totally transforms both the content and the delivery of healthcare which I think is very instructive for us as a way to deal with the burden of chronic disease so I think you Pioneer not only the content of how to treat disease but also the delivery model
 and are also told me once that I did this when the day was very resistant to functional medicine functional medicine without a word I can use so we called it there if it lasts and it's not like I did it with no functional medicine testing we only did things that we can just order through primary care clinics almost hosting B12 folate vitamin D levels lipids A1c
and I had to grease. The only thing so I could use work B12 plain B12 not the metal version play plain B12 B complex and fish oil I can let people go by on their own if they wanted methylfolate methyl B12 and acetyl cysteine and algae so very very basic salmon is tremendous and it's it's really testing the power of food as medicine so any other questions
 there's an online question here Terry that asked if you are have worked with any other kinds of estem such as cold laser or frequency specific microcurrent so I've worked cold laser myself I have a specific I have not work with it myself I've also worked individually with a beamer opposed electromagnetic field mice
I found that to be helpful
 but tonight you said in our clinical trial any other questions
 you touched on this a little bit
 you touched on the little bit when you said the grandkids are coming over and you ate all the trees before they got their how long do people take to recover after they could have fallen off the wagon as it were so let me touch a little bit so we've had people have dramatic results lupus are a Scleroderma mice eat humans being what we are after 6 months feel like I could indulge and a few people get by with occasional Indulgence and don't get into trouble we also find some people have an occasional Indulgence get a dramatic Flair of their disease and then it may take many weeks to get the disease
we may have to take a pulse is Medrol or some other disease-modifying therapy so I do a much more explicit recommendation that if you get response and you stop the program you're stopping disease-modifying treatment and you should expect a disease flare
 are you letting myself I want to get very clear that if I accidentally get exposed to gluten in 24 to 72 hours I'll get a flare of my face pain that is horrific that will be so horrific I cannot you know you'll see jolting I will be able to talk I may not be able to walk I'll need high-dose prednisone I may need high-dose Solu-Medrol to stop it so I now carry prednisone with me so if I get my first twinge of pain I'll be in my prednisone taper or early so I can hopefully not need that
send incredible statement that food is it disease-modifying truck
 thought you were the BB the connection with a microbiome seems incredibly interesting and just very recently coming up and also I'm four other types of diets that have been I say somewhat successful or have provided a lot of comfort to people with his like the one by dr. jelenic I believe I just wonder if but four four four patients that are all over you know the internet learning about both these approaches if you have some connections with him that you would explore house micro the microbiome is modified through the different approaches this is a question so I do have the opportunity that we've had.
all over the globe donate to the walls research lab and so in the study who are comparing the Wahls diet in a Swank. We are freezing microbiome we're freezing blood for so we'll be able to do an analysis of the changes in the microbial and we'll see what happens if you follow it looks like the diet or you follow the walls or you just doing our usual care so we'll have that will also have we're freezing DNA and RNA swivel chair gene expression as well
 so yes he's a great questions and we will be able to answer them one last question
 so just to clarify your gluten intolerance or sensitivity maybe I missed it you are not a true Celiac by definition of mistake and I are almost our colleagues is Austin it's only GI relay
so I just wanted to emphasize the fact that you have extreme outward symptoms by Expose yourself seclude incorrect I have extreme pain and in addition I will get other neurological symptoms so my most recent exposure that resulted in the face paint also had weakest of my right hand that took weeks to recover it is interesting when I was working with the MS Society to do this at the trial that we're doing the swing versus Wallside there was a request to have a crossover and we discuss when that people thought I should do a cross over the side and a lot of reasons do that they'd be very nice but there's a problem at the CLE I can't possibly do that because if one of my apostasies is that there's going to be a subset of folks who have severe symptoms of gluten and then I Cry
come over
 you know I'm going to intensely create harm and I just said no I can't do that design
 Satori there's some other questions online as well I we've got about 250 people who been watching this live stream right here through ifm and I'll be rebroadcast for the next 24 hours but they asked about what what do you do with vegan patients are vegetarian patients
 and my pill E friends give me a really hard time for being so sympathetic to vegans and vegetarians but you know how I was one for quite a while so I am quite sympathetic we do have a bye first level diet I have people use gluten-free grains of course gluten-free legumes soak them for at least six hours day that sprouting process modifies the lectins
a big problem lectins are the compounds that plants use to poison animals so we don't eat eat the plants and they're mostly target in sex but for people are genetically susceptible to seeds can make you ill there for those who have a chronic disease were somewhat more likely to have sensitivity to those selected
 that's one of the reasons to avoid seeds of legumes eat seeds and legumes soaking them for at least six hours greatly reduces the inflammatory impact of those lectins
 no I mean seats
 sew-in in people who are sensitive even pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds nuts and seeds may be a problem I don't take nuts and seeds away from most people in our diet and did my clinical trial we do
always in the clinical trial will have them either avoid the nuts and seeds or soak them for 6 hours and then we reintroduce after 12 weeks questions
 I mean I have a question you didn't mention fat the implied it but you know since he's lots of fat and I talked about the ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 ideally about three to four make a sixth every to make it 3% of a cell membrane to see the saturated fat or cholesterol so I don't view cholesterol as a problem I don't do saturated fat as a problem I think oil olive oil and any liquid oil that is liquid at room temperature should be eating cold and not heated because when you heat it you damaged
the antioxidant components and you increase the possibility of oxidizing that fat so we do want people to eat fat I was just so much information I I delete the fat out but yes we stress that it's very big so so it in their diet for Fidelity we stress at least four servings of grain everyday in less than 15 grams of saturated fat in my diet with stress all the vegetables and at least 20 grams of saturated fat every day going to be sure that there's plenty of spread between the two diet thank you thank you dr. Wallace has been really extraordinary conversation and that you really done pioneering work I think the thing that I wanted to emphasize is that most people think the functional medicine is about testing about supplements and you've been able to do this in a poor population but little resources without extensive testing or extensive
fishing using the power of food as medicine organic food so much for your time. Go out in your work thank you
