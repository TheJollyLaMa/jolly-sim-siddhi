I just mowing the lawn listening to shoot security
 oh my God he's had so much nice time with probably use the personal secretary or not the servant the personal servant man he did like all the massage him and take care of it to make sure all the little things are taken care of really intimate you have to be like right by Prop Hunt side at all times and he was talking about this morning when I my treadmill this morning at 8 to stop talking about how about pot on the plane he said we'll probably go on the plane it would almost be like you know
 you act a certain way around your children and then when you're away from your children you just sort of act a different way so I probably had acted different when he had no disciples around and so on the plane he just did his own thing when that stewardess said that you got to have to sit there like 10 and said you got to sit down stand up he was just sort of like no one was going to tell problem with you on that plane he talked to ever
buddy did engage with people he always like to look like a vaishnava sits at 8 he said he do you go to the bathroom make sure it's t lock was on nicely you make sure he'd leave the plane and with a nice Garland at the devotees have given him but he also said something really really that stuck out of my head that that was very sanguine and bury it like important for me today to hear you said you know in 1975
 he he was he was married his wife just had a baby and it was living in Hawaii and when they got to Hawaii with probably said profit I think I want to just stay with my family now and probably isn't he said he said I want to preach he said well my preachings not good and so then he said he said no problems understanding so we stay with his family goes and then the course two years later Pro
I left the planet and should be cured it was like we never had any idea that a problem how was going to leave the planet you don't think like well he's going to you're not thinking like that and this time that we get with the voters who we look up to that have been expired as that is so precious cuz devotees also leave this world and then they're only held in this world by sound so now you want to hang out with crock pot we hear it by sound only you know we hear those instructions we get to associate with them on YouTube or in our minds and our memories in a photograph but that valuable time together it's so precious it's so precious coming together with the devotees and appreciating what we have now
 and it was just like a like a wake up call for me with all the people that I cherish in my life and to not did not take it for granted you can you can see this person the other day and I hope you around
now may not be
 and I am very nice very nice and prove that I'm stupid I approve this message by Rock and there's other ones I don't approve of what I do for a r d Lane
 Rd Laing I think it's pronounced Lane but I'm really not sure that the g at the end may be silent
 what is her name before he was a Scottish psychiatrist who wrote extensively on mental illness in particular psychosis and schizophrenia and his views on the causes and treatment of psychopathological phenomenon were influenced by his study of existential philosophy and ran counter to the chemical and electroshock methods that would become psychic
Orthodoxy he was against that apparently yeah
 electric shock imagine that I mean I thought was a thing as a mental illness or do you know what we're just going to shock and the chemical thing is a big thing now
 yeah yeah I mean they said lobotomize people and that his views were going to say influenced by study of existential philosophy clearly
 is you hear some Eastern philosophy blended into things he's saying particularly in the quote that we're going to rain today it's like it's almost like we're still clueless about it about about dealing with this type of mental illness the western western medicine
it's too bad to be making my statement it's a bit is incredible and he being a part-time even quite sure they can pray be patient and it works great study
 okay is what it says
 true sanity
 entails in one or another in one way or another the dissolution of the normally go that's false self competently adjusted to our alienated social reality we just read that part again
entails in one way or another the dissolution of the normally go that false self of competently adjusted that that shot that false self Kant competently adjusted to our alienated social reality
 we have a false conception of the self that has been adjusted to our alienated social reality
 the circumstances that were in right now
 we've got a false conception of who we are in relation to this
 so-called reality that were in okay
 and through this death and rebirth
 and the eventual re-establishment of a new kind of ego functioning
 the eagle now being the servant of the Divine
 no longer is it betrayer that's pretty amazing I mean that's pretty much the whole thing right there the whole thing
Rd Laing it's like it's almost like what version of the upanishads did you read to come up with this yeah he speaks this is like the weather upanishads been talking about for Millenia here
 sometimes to be normal in this crazy world is quite abnormal
 mothers would definitely want me to look at it and I think was Christian more to that had that statement like that right to be well adjusted to a to a
 I forget how he characterized the world but is if we're well adjusted to this world we've got issues that's ever get the exact maybe someone knows that statement
 but I hear he's saying that okay truce what is true sanity not just sanity in terms of how we do here we go thank you two to be well-adjusted to profoundly 6 Society is no measure of Health
hey I think the truth is shooting for marra's job what do you think about that shooting right on the ball every time I Married an appointment down her knitting needles
 but I took a statue sanity and Tails in one way or another somehow what maybe this yogic method and maybe that yogic method write the dissolution of the normal Eva what show proper to call the false ego
 this is you know just a very common idea that you'll find throughout they don't to write that this false conception of who we are has to dissolve
 write to some method or another
 it's got to dissolve that's what yoga is all about getting past that false the false conception of Who You Are
now what he says it's so interesting it's so it's it's almost like he's going to probably books where he says that you know what's presented most widely in the western world is made unto is it going to rain on Thursday I do that once you dissolve that false ego
 there's no individuality left you don't exist as an individual anymore you you realize that you are just everything that you that there is no me and you even this whole world
 was a an illusion and there just is this Divine Light that you are he says it in a very different way he says what's consistent with the body of a doctor write that once that the default conception to self
 dissolves then he says a new kind of ego functioning arises or less a is route
am I supposed to say news is misleading it's like the original the original ego Underneath It All the original identity is revealed in that ego is now
 the servant of the Divine you realize all I was a servant of the vine no longer it's betrayer right there's like a hint or a clue to to the entire
 reason why were locked into this virtual reality with all these false ideas is somehow it's a betrayal somehow we betrayal that betrayed that source that is our
 was about to beat this going to say this very best friends of the living entity you know you turned away from in desperation desperation meets just like ignorance we desperately reach out for anything to give
an idea of self so I got the guys with beards into the guys were like into having beards or we're into like New York or New England Brewery in two like a baseball team the Patriots or the Boston Red Sox or the whatever we're into we're trying to find identity desperately something to latch on to some tribe to find sense of self all the political stuff to the huge one I'll go to different political I'm on both sides just to hear the comments and they're just like anything to hate the other side and to give yourself I did to take bolster one's own sense of identity can't we say like actually they have one good point here at the book for everything that every Democrat believes in and once I've signed up for Republican I delete everything they can't there be like can it can't they have two good things and we have three good things why does it
desperate for an identity and when and when the identity ships
 people lose their mind people I had a situation once
 when I was in shelter room shelter was getting bigger and we were on MTV in Europe does anybody remember MTV it was like a whole different thing but I knew this guy from MTV and he showed up at some big snowboarding event we did in the Alps and and I was like the guy from MTV's here and he came up to me we started talking and he and I and I said house MTV going and he goes they fired me
 and I was like off sorry what are you doing now he goes they cannot fire me I lost I lost his mind my people will not stand for it I am a nameless from MTV and if they think they can fire me my pee
I will not stand for it by people and I was thinking myself of you I don't have any people to go and hire someone new or a younger and fresher and you're his whole identity was submitted to your going to be crushed if you identify with that role because your ears about to be separated from you oh my God oh my God I seen this in spiritual circles to you know like one adopts the the false identity of what's a renunciate all right you know they have trouble living that life and then when it gets taken from that will this is how I'm known as the monk as the and now we treat take that away from me so I can make it here at you know I got to hide that's why sometimes if there is a monkey like a Swami that just can't go off following those vows
 it's just like I don't even want to be around these people anymore but it's not like I want to okay
if I'm biking and I'm driving biking biking really fast if I can't fight that fast and I can't keep my Pace I want to keep I'll just go slower but I don't say I'm just getting off the bike now but sometimes we're so in that concept of self like I am a run do you say it then if I can't do it I just like to know what I want to play at all I want I want to go back to being something just like you becomes too embarrassing or is it Sarah saying so yeah it is it's like we're not we're not the renunciate we're not the city I see one of the Swami not the guru we're not the agree hasta we are the servants where that where the tiny spiritual being or not they were able to learn a New England Patriot fan we're not that all these secondary to used to the degree that we extend our real self to be that
Zekrom EX happy some temporary pleasure in your you know people do with their gender preference is what I am and I'm lgbtq and I'm the only thing that's actually going to make you happy
 is a spirit so I'm here to serve something bigger have some little mini tribe I like motorcycles you know that's why I got a mini motorcycle tribe you like ride bicycles I like riding bicycles I love the Northeast it's beautiful here you know what I mean but it's sort of like you can have them and I'm just saying you can have a mini tribe that you belong to a temporary tribe you might have to move locations you might have to change the club you're in or or all those temporary identities that we play those were hate parents do it when their kids move out of the house some parents don't want their kids to move out of the house and they lose their mind when the kids go off and they got through refined like who am I now in real life
check with my wife and a household when my kids are grown up and they get they go through this identity crisis that empty nest syndrome cause Scuba
 you're right right you're like you've been an empty nester your whole life you just come over here but why some eggs for you that's okay and inbox how it's going to talk about like this these subtle yogic path of the dissolution of the ego and I think as we go through we can kind of considered how is my false ego dissolving at least gradually right am I moving in that right direction how am I how am I eating that process how am I
still taking the process of the dissolution of my false conception of self and you know how will that true self arise underneath it
 come again
 no one should I respect the base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Rishi the most human being today the author not stopped prior authorization in Schaumburg about 7 but it's Troublesome the heart because I love you service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transmetal songs will be established as in a revocable fact
Morgana to Miranda see again and I was born in the darkness of ignorance by teachers are open in my eyes at the torch of knowledge base and seize their load of speed-reading for female by the time can do 7 chapter 15 text 52
 so we're here we're seeing or hearing a comparison comparative study of the property Mark the path of of trying to find happiness through material prosperity and gain compared with the Liberty Marga the the path where you let go of all of the day I eat like a even the idea that I'm going to find my happiness to material gain and yesterday we're hearing about the the path of material gain and it was said that even if you do is so expertly that you ride through your rituals do the that the sacrifices that they would do
that one could rise up to higher planets and enjoy on levels that are unimaginable to us but then it's it pointed out but you know what will open into that you know is the the come down you got to come there is everything down that's the nature of the material energy that it goes up and down that is the time that the force of time strips from it it's just a high its you can stay high in the heavens time has that effect that whatever it is that you have if its material you won't have it it's even in this world we see like even cultures they've they flourished they've been successful they they they have power or they have a culture and education and then they get crushed by another
 another Army comes
another Nation tribe comes through another kingdom comes through and crushes their Kingdom the Rome gets crushed into the Ottoman Empire gets crushed what you think you're riding high and you just eventually get crushed there's no doubt and took that you come down so that yeah that's the message that this should be what do we used to have what we call those we had to have the number different than Australia at 4848 that letdown is woven into the path of material enjoyment it's it's inescapable
 okay then what's the alternative now we could never going to read about that today stay high forever for that tea that this is really a problem you can't allow this anymore don't make that tea if you don't make it he's not going to make it I've never made it
maybe after the show fun likes me a little happy Pappy after the show it's okay it's his life by the grace of his parents through the process of purification known as Garmadon so saying that is talking about these Vedic rituals Miss and there's a Vedic ritual to call you in to the certain family so that the a certain sold and it's certain womb garbage garbage garbage garbage panda
 garbage garbage on some scar at the practice of purification to draw a you do it before you have a baby
 I'm playing baby you know people just like no we got Bryce happened prize surprise thanks for that Mom thanks for letting me know
now that I was just surprised you were God's Little on the grand prize golf there's that there's supposed to be like a focus when you want a baby Focus the garbage done is the rituals to call a soul into the womb is that incredible is it such an interesting way and then end it when the Consciousness is very high for the man and the woman that attracts a certain soul and then so that's the beginning of Life what about the end of life sentence
 there are also other process up here but keishon until the end of life
 AKA the death Doula when the funeral Ceremony be it's called the unty SD Korea is performed ending purification I wonder if that is you know well involve the burning of the body generally it I think there's something like that
washing of the skull serious at the end
 that during the Bernie crushing myself go like that it's something like now you has no taken shelter this body anymore so yeah because it is also purifying for the those hat watching the body there this person is not there
 they're not there anymore not now now in the previous verse were hearing about how all of these they're called some scars or or young has these different sacrifices these different rituals use different rights rights of Passage in life house especially we're hearing about this the different sacrifices and rituals how they how they could look open up these ancient Vedic texts and say oh look you can perform these rituals for the purpose of increasing one's material enjoyment
but then it says you're going to have to come back down now and this verse is saying that there's there's rituals for birth there's rituals throughout life all the way up until death but a qualified person a person is seeing clearly recognizes that I'm not going to use these for material enjoyment there's a higher purpose for them that they do have an effect on the on the psyche right that's that's what their that's this is such an interesting thing about this Vedic culture is the Inn in our every society has its rituals right has its Rites of Passage in life and it's got its birth ceremonies and its coming-of-age ceremonies and its vomit sparge marriage ceremonies and it's ultimately its death ceremonies yeah
 in our cultural called like a wedding ceremony and there are rituals built into it that we don't even know why we do it anymore
why shouldn't the husband are we throwing Rice wife return rice white rice before the marriage this that so many things are there why are they wearing white why is he wearing a tuxedo with my white what's the Garter about I still don't get that but all of these you know they were originally happened over your head like where that come from originally have a purpose that has to do with the impression that they leave in the mind right that's that's how ritual is designed as meant to make a shift make an impression in your mind that's the purpose of it where I can you research throwing the bouquet of flowers for the bride over the head see where that came from but in this made a call to they were
 they were so attuned to this they're so
this this so well understood what they're doing and designed it so well that they called the rituals some scars which literally means mental impression so like like as we would say okay now we're going to perform the wedding ceremony they would literally be saying now we're going to perform the wedding mental impression
 right at the death mental impression it's like we're all meant to be changed by this our minds are meant to be shaped by this lettuce lettuce be shaped by this in a way that is going to be positive and Lead towards the dissolution or false eagle and the the the arising of the true self you know you can call it like an anchor to sometimes you might your parents treated you a certain way and they fed you and every time you taste that food as you get older it reminds you of home it reminds you of love it reminds you she put these impressions in the Consciousness when we start to drift away from Mexico
your marriage is getting tough but you have this some ska right to drag you back of why you were doing in the commitments you made and some higher principle there and anchor this back to Dharma basically he have those anchors you say anchors yesterday were talking about them as what was the word that means limiting principal someone's materialistic drives that's a great way to put it in there are you going to information we were dying to find out about the throwing the bouquet over that this rock and I think so cuz she was here what do you got
 things according to sheet Google G+ farther but it's
 created to bestow luck upon the guests so
 single women were desperate to catch the bouquet as marriage was the old
play to bring a woman and her family out of poverty so the single women would all like elbow their way out of each other who is seamores necessity that are romantic act over the years it's now evolved into a fun way for the bride okay well road rage on the message board says rice and ancient ritual in ancient nuptial tradition that acts as a blessing for fertility and prosperity he also says the wedding bouquet toss is it tradition that dates back to the 1300 England the bride tosses her bouquet to unmarried women during the wedding reception and whoever catches it said to be the next in line to be wed that we know that we know that
 road rage if you're trying to get Mary's job you got to do better than that obvious over here have a good vegan meatball up your sleeve okay
pretty good memes okay he's saying it's symbolic for fertility and good luck good luck is often tied to these to get you to do them get out of it but anyway let's set that aside now let's get back to where we were 53 don't know if they were still in 52, that you born in a particular family of barometers of like people that are pursuing truth in life as the Hyatt you guys. I made that there
 their principal, and why what what role will these rituals play in their life let us continue with 52
 does in due course he qualified Brahman becomes uninterested the materialistic activities and sacrifices but he offers the sensual sacrifices in full knowledge into the working senses
illuminated by the fire of knowledge so he's still doing the work but he's doing it in full now necessarily I think not necessary
 when the senses are illuminated by knowledge in other words this our senses are generally pulling us in this way or that way and ignorance right to invade Dante in in this in this Vedic philosophy
 knowledge renunciation like the two words Guiana which means knowledge and vairagya which means renunciation of Detachment they're so close these two concepts are so closely associated, like the two words are made like one compound piano vairagya I can vairagya which means the ideas that when you know when you actually see things for what they truly are when you know that you can actually let go
when I know that the objects of the senses don't Grant lasting satisfaction then I let go and so in a sense when you say the senses are illuminated with knowledge we mean that when my knowing is so complete when my Jana is so deep that my senses are no longer pulling me that we could say my senses have been illuminated by knowledge they're no longer pulling me to the objects of the senses with their false promise of filament principal
 has been you know that that these rich these these sacrifices these ritual sacrifices they are these limiting principles that are helping us keep our life straight right I'm going to get married I'm going to perform the ceremony I'm going to marry I'm going to limit my drives for sexuality to one person is a limiting principle
 and in all these rituals kind of have
they're the purpose in that kind of keeping us the narrowing our path to keep it going straight you know but when our senses are illuminated with knowledge then went since we don't need them anymore we can let go of all the rituals and so on we we can dissolve that once that knowledge has is hot enough it burns way the need to perform these rituals
 private property rights here
 in a commentary he he he says those interested in materialistic activities remain in the cycle of birth and death that the the property Mark write the path of material enjoyment property Marga or the inclination to stay in the material world to enjoy varieties of sense of gratification has been explained in the previous verse that was talking about going to the Emily planets and doing all the rituals and so I'm now in this verse it is explained that one who has perfect for medical knowledge rejects the process of elevation of our planets in except Liberty Marga in other words
a m self to go back home back to godhead right I'm not interested in the enjoyment of this world I'm interested in what's beyond that or in one sense what's beneath that I'm no longer interested in my false conception of the South I want to burn that in the fire of knowledge I want to burn the my materialistic drives in the fire of knowledge and then these rituals I can let them go go to the next stage of refinement and property rights cases this is a little difficult to understand
 but it is very easy if one takes to Krishna Consciousness seriously and tries to understand Krishna
 and we can get back to that point but there's like this idea that you know what they say at the end of the bug of agita the bug of agita is largely a a comparative study of different religious or yogurt practices but in the end Christmas has abandoned all those religions abandon all those yoga's and do one thing
 surrender unto me sarva Dharma
Buju Banton all the different religions all the different rituals all the different sacrifices and do one sacrifice just give yourself to me take shelter that route of existence in and everything's taken care of so that's app that Krishna factors like a very important factor going to hear about a very subtle yogic process of dissolving the ego and in the following versus but probably think it could be done in a very simple way if you just give yourself to Krishna wonder if we could talk to Sam script pundit and find a better way to say surrender because yesterday were talking about surrender sounds like a SWAT team has caught me and they just got put your hands up face on the ground on your knees what is it all the way ready there's another way to think of surrender also though like sometimes it in in the context of romance sweet surrender sweet surrender
that one
 or the other or is that John Denver to write
 no it's no it's no I didn't even know her name was Frankie Valli the Four Seasons yeah that's so damn hold but but but part of the surrender is is like this mood right this idea
 I've tried the property Mark lifetime after Lifetime right I've try to enjoy the things of this world turning my back on you
 resisting you now I surrender to you right
sweet surrender is I still think we should rename it you know you need you need to talk to to Kurama about that because he wants gave a thorough argument defending the middle of the militaristic Jones surrender to love again surrender could be understood in love with us because we use the word surrender like that you know
 will know his point was the way that the guards surrendered to authorities today I don't want to look at myself as some criminal we want to hear from to Quran who says you are a criminal and you have to surrender your criminal Tendencies of being self-centered more about this so far what's happened
is he saying that all the rituals that are performed got burned up in the fire of the illuminated senses once once the senses were hot with knowledge there was no they were no longer being pulled towards materialistic sense medication I was able to attend the rituals that I do dissolved into that they're no longer that's where they dissolve it now he's going to go through levels of dissolution one after the other
 band named we're levels of dissolution prog-rock band or one of those kind of weird kind of metal rap band kind of things
 it was a really big band that has a name this like that from Long Island I think they're from levels to do
 I forgot
I don't know
 the mind is always agitated by the waves of acceptance and rejection acceptance and rejection there for all the activities of the senses should be offered into the mind which should be offered into one's words than one's words should be offered into the aggregate of all alphabets which should be offered into the concise form own car own car should be offered in to the point vindu vindu vindu into the vibration of sound and that vibration into the life are
 then the living entity who is All That Remains then the living entity who is All That Remains should be placed in Bremen the Supreme this is the process of sacrifice okay I didn't get that way if I was reading this myself a be like
next thing I know that's where you have to dig and dig around anyone around this Stone I can't say that I fully understand this
 but I gave us Scooby-Doo like I've got something from the ideas that once something becomes unnecessary it dissolves into the next stage the ones that's unnecessary it dissolves into the next stage and you going to keep dissolving until all that's left is the self brummond spirit I do you know a Humber Moss me I am spirit and then we recognize that spirit in relation to the Supreme that becomes the sacrifice and other was your note The Vedas speak about all the sacrifice which is doing these rituals throwing in the throwing the key and the grain Into the Fire to achieve some materialistic purpose a Pious materialistic purpose this
saying take that idea of that ritual and this is going to become our sacrifice we're going to burn one thing after the other when we're not talking about this external sacrifice what we're talking about is an internal levels of offering one thing into the next offering one thing into the next until there's nothing left but the South so it is kind of like a metaphor in that sense when it says this is the process of sacrifice but the ideas
 we let go of the ritual because the senses were now no longer demanding the things of this world I didn't have to restrain them through ritual right you understand ritual is a way to engage the senses in a positive way because they want to run wild right but once they were illuminated by knowledge and with knowledge the renunciation the letting-go then I offered the ritual into the census it it burned out cuz the sensors were hot now right so okay fine then you're going to hit says you offer the census you let go the census
into the mind when you get that mine fully illumined with knowledge
 now you've let go of the senses and now you're you're no longer pursuing the things of this world through the senses that all you got this internal subtle sacrifice going on
 and then so you so you could let go of the senses you have offered to them to the mind
 and I used you like all the mind and offering to sound her into speech that's parts that you know I think we need a real Vedic scholar to dig into that more but we're at least two as it goes to munch right it says that now you are offering sound or speech into the Mantra in to own
 right so it's like I've let go my ritual I let go of my senses I've let go of my material mind programming and now I'm just absorbed in Montreal right and then even the muncher is kind of like deconstructed cuz you know when it says
when do you know that the arm has that little. Like which is the bend Usos kind like you compress or you dissolve the ohm down to this one point
 and then that's offered into Grumman right that's offered into till there's nothing left but spirit
 right and then you and then you exist there as your true self without all the external comes you boiled it down to finer and finer levels of existence and then it's just you and the super solid there you know end it without any not now that's one level of that's what that's that's one path of dissolution that we just watched her or you can say refinement or distill Asian of boiling down yeah now another would that can be described in another way and text 45 I'm sorry 5454 okay maybe the last one
on this path of ascent the progressive living entity enters the different worlds of fire the Sun the day the end of the day the bright fortnight
 that's when the moon is getting bigger the full moon the passing of the Sun in the north along with their presiding demigods when he answers Brahma Loca he enters then he enjoys life for many millions of years and finally his material designation comes to an end it all even after a million years he then comes to a subtle designation from which she attains the causal designation witnessing all previous States upon the annihilation of this causal State he retains his pure state in which he identifies with the Super Soul in this where the living entity becomes transcendental
 it's a whole thing so it's on the
explain this to stay with us ok Google, down from the TV now or I sort of like next what's the next one what let's just share this
 that it's saying that you attain the worlds of Fire the song the day the end of the day what and I looked at a commentary on this initial it was saying was one at eanes the deities the DD of fire the DD of the Sun the deed of the day the DD of the end of the day there DD's gods and goddesses for each of these when it says so it's saying you hurt any one after the other you going up levels in the universe what it says that you've attained the DD I don't know if that means you become the DD like you would come the Sun God and then you become you know or if it means that you're accepted by that Didi to exist on that plane but you're rising up through the levels of the universe
 one step at a time
fine until you it and ended each level you got a body that's more subtle than the one that you had before
 and eventually you give up the gross body entirely and you attain the causal body which is the subtle body
