 I got to look at it together
puzzle coming together
 what's up with you good I'm ready to get into the show
 are nugget today is from EF Schumacher Schumacher is never heard of them
 he's a fascinating man Ernst Friedrich show shumar CBE was a British statistician an economist who is best known for its proposals for human scale decentralised and appropriate Technologies in his 1995 in 1995 his 1973 book small is beautiful a study of Economics as if people mattered
 was ranked by the times literary supplement is one of the most 100 most influential books published since WWII
 in 1977 he published a guide for
perplexed as a critique of materialistic scientism and as an exploration of the nature and organization of knowledge
 you know I just had a little green icing like a fascinating man that he was some kind of refugee
 from Germany during World War Two and was being held in some kind of internment camp in England or in Great Britain
 and I he wrote a paper on economics that was just so revolutionary that what state is Maynard Keynes most important, mr. I'm not I'm not brushed up on my economic apparently had a lot to do with like Reviving the economies of both England and Germany after World War II but you know what I get from him you know you had an interest in Buddhism had an interest in Catholicism
you know deep spiritual interests and I could see you in a few was looking at the world as an economist looking at the resources and realizing that we don't have a mature approach we don't have a well-thought-out approach to life here is not sustainable is not intelligent so this quote is and it just when I thought vgr on the message board says it's eating Kenzie Kenzie and economics
 here's what he says an attitude to life which seeks fulfillment in the single-minded pursuit of wealth in short materialism does not fit into this world because it contains within itself no limiting principle while the environment in which it is placed is strictly limited we read that again
an attitude to life which seeks with filament in a single-minded pursuit of wealth in short materialism does not fit into this world because it contains within itself no limiting principle
 while the environment in which it is placed is strictly Limited
 you know we we last week I think it was said we we read this letter May was a week before I forget really read a letter from she'll probably who was writing to a disciple
 and the disciple obviously had some complaints about the circumstances in the situation that he's in the temple how things are going there who is doing what excetera right and she'll probably just the issue we just tried to take that person up to higher level than in other words it's not all about changing the environment is about how you are prepared to adapt to the environment so he said a vaishnava right about the Oggy
 is one who's able to sit down anywhere anyplace anytime you satisfied
right and I think what shoe maker is saying here
 Schumacher Schumacher
 is that what you don't like imagine if you took a bunch of people and you lock him in a room for a weekend and I don't know there were some I do bag of Doritos in their right mind if their conception was my only happiness is through eating Doritos will then there's going to be a problem in that room and resources to fight over those resources I'm an experienced suffering because of the lack of those resources and that's the world that we have because our world is driven by materialistic Paradigm right we need oil can fit to get that you know it's like we're we're if we were able to look at the world in a different way and I don't want to say the world I mean if we're able to have a different worldview
happiness is not based off of sense gratification that's attained through wealth but if we if we had a different view that was happiness is something that found within
 external things can be reduced
 write the way that he he phrase this is he said that
 there is in this is a very big with Tom ask kind of statement that he made that he said an attitude to life which seeks fulfillment through single-minded pursuit of wealth and short materialism does not fit into this world because it can because it contains within itself no limiting principle and we all can quote that verse from Bible time which says that for one who senses are uncontrolled
 or or it says that that how does it begin that arises because such a good verse for one who sends uncontrolled
that there's one who has unlimited Desires in this world can never satisfy the senses for one whose senses are uncontrolled exactly when it comes to the material realm if we don't have a self-imposed limiting principle
 then we are going to suffer and what to speak of when you put lots of people that have no material limiting principle has a lot of questions about like the idea of spiritual practices which we have so many misconceptions and so many Miss applications of like regulation and spiritual life regulation of diet regulation of sleep regulation sex you know reggae reggae
these things have often been presented to us as like just regulate or minimize otherwise you go to a dark dark place of suffering you go to hell is completely gone what where is the UN yoga it becomes clear that I'm going to place
 a limiting principle
 I'm not materialistic drives for the sake of peace of mind which will grant me the bility to enter into to bring my mind to spiritual thought right I'm going to consciously place a living principal for very important purpose as long as there's I don't place a limiting principle on my materialistic drives I will be pulled by the Wild Horses of my senses I will go through ups and downs when I cheat sense gratification I feel very good elated and when did the
loss of that or burn out of that occurs then I will go down my Consciousness will go down I will suffer because of it so the yoga says let me place a limiting principle on my materialistic drive right that's what marriage is about right I'm not going to pursue sex with unlimited I'm going to limit it to one person you know that's what you no dietary restrictions and so on and and when I go to sleep and when I wake up it's all like a science you know our strategy for how to limit my materialistic drive so that they won't interfere with my spiritual Pursuit and the interesting thing is by curbing the Passions
 you get happiness for those who want happiness and you actually get step to Liberation because it's not it's not Liberation but it's a doorstep to Liberation the first you got to regulate the census if you just want to be happy in this world
you have to regulate the census is it such and such a mousetrap it is the unrestricted sense gratification Whenever there is culture or philosophical groups coming up we got to be free and adults the senses so I call you silly people it don't you it's so silly it's like the ABCs of material existence and plan this to people is use the verse of large Italian not then I'm no gentleman the sundaram and the three the three dead ends of material existence and this one is not
 Dunham's right in that that the meaning of well well right there's no amount of material wealth that will make me feel whole
 and what happens if you get a little bit of well and then you think okay now what can I do from here
and cell
 you see even in people who have regulated income no say okay this is the house I can get or the apartment I can get this is the car I can drive and then they get an increase in that but increase their car quality they increase the square footage of their home and I mean and everything is expanding in a little bit more then they have exorbitant amount of extra well okay what should I do now you're thinking we'll what should I do maybe it's a boat maybe I should have a boat if I can get a boat were always trying to find your God in something something deep for filming satisfaction that comes with an F yeah and then there's some people who have no problem with boarding the boat so that have a boat and then they'll find it then I say okay now that I have a boat when I do it's a lot and then what else can we do but we can vacation a lot and it's an ever-expanding
 like Labyrinth that will never ends
 and it is complicated
it is complicating my life because all these things that you get an accumulate need maintenance
 and what happens is you find that you can go to the very ends of it you can have a house here and the house there and the house there is here I don't have some of the Northeast Warehouse in the Northeast Us in the European I want a house in Spain or Portugal will never and will never actually give you what you want because you're thinking with your material mind and you're thinking with your material passions the actual thing that'll make you happy is to recognize I'm a spiritual being and I need God that's it and then you then God will give you something important your karma will get some things
 and and you'll be happy with those things but there's an endless Pursuit if we without that knowledge ahead of time you'll think why
material being and success means to keep going down that path into my senses are finally satisfied it's not going to happen cuz you're not a material being a spiritual being it never and you're just going to die without a collection of tons of junk tons of stuff and you'll have people tried a trip that stuff out of your hands for there since gratification you get that yet but you get followed by people who just want your junk wish your death because they want your stuff like after you dye it is a vultures that they're just like flying around in a circle over like some animal it's dying down there in the desert to die people trying to marry you for your money for your eat you won't even know who your friends are anymore to endless Pursuit
all the time says you know like this even the children the family members can become vultures that just wait for you to die or is it historically and and we think we're being said this before we we we think we're being benevolent by giving the kids whenever they want or you know patting them so they don't have a completely worry-free life guess what you give a kid of War III life and that creates the stress that you think that helps them grow that when they when they have no worries and nothing no problems to fix your feeding their inner vulcher
 yeah I'll be there in her Swan be there in a swan give him nothing
 you know what I feel when I and I only read the Wikipedia thing about us I don't really know where am I
but it seems to me like his that he had some spiritual drive you know it turned towards Buddhism a turn towards Catholicism the deeps spiritual Essence in the wisdom from these Traditions what a what a
 what an important thing to have people with that kind of insight involved in helping direct our economies and sound like Chris imagine he's a person okay he's in England and World War 2 is just been one and he's you know and he's got a role in it and in advising the British government in terms of economics that was a time you know the forties and then especially going to the fifties words just like it seems like there was like a pink Rosy Cloud over everyone that liked materialism will satisfy a booming like
and everybody's just recognizing you know everybody you know there's plenty of employment there's plenty of money and all these new invite you know there's cars now are going to have babies ride free if you have time to kids find happiness in materialism and by the time the sixties hit in
 you know like to use for looking and saying this is not real this is a moral this is a win I want something else but here's a guy that you know early on is recognizing hey this Martian to materialism is not going to work out
 you know in an even way back then he was saying things like this is a quote of his production from local resource this is this is just like Pro pods first Canto commentaries report production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life
that's River Medical thought it says grammatical thought right there and unfortunately you know the flaw of democracy
 is that to get to get elected you need to cater to the materialistic drives of the people you need to say I'm going to satisfy your materialistic drives you can't step I'm 6 I'm going to place a limitation of limiting principal on your materialistic dry the Pet Taxi once required you know there needs to be an adult in the room and it sounds like he was an adult in the room so you know what I've been doing just after the prophet appearance day I'm just all day long yesterday me and Mara been listening to these remember to the Power Pod to videos
how to put a instead of a kind of slow when I was mowing lawns yesterday and we had a big long I was mowing yesterday and it was yes that's one great story after another bike in doing the same thing just listen to Proud pie two people glorifying and appreciating their Guru it is satisfying thing you could do for your heart and I I was just thinking I'm so happy right now I'm just so happy when I remember being a Brahma Cherry when you had no time to do anything else except here serve here champ service like that would sleep a little and then cold shower and then he chances are here cancer patients and that's all you did and as a household that you're a little bit more splayed and you dip your toes if not fully dive into a deep pool of Maya
occasionally but it's like any here can serve as much as you can't hear can't serve as much as the camera dip in Maya you know go to go to the Smash Up Derby and here she can't serve a little bit and then you know champ Camp weekend cheering like a white sheer like hands in the air like I'm ready to drive get a car you answer it maybe that would be a way for you to just vent some of those while I do it yes there you go like who's that guy in the middle just parked in peace dad mentioned that I was on
 that I was listening to a talk that my daughter gave back in 1994 where he was reading from I believe from cropley Lomita from Provo
biography and then commenting on it and hearing that recording just did things in my mind and in my heart that were so satisfying you know it was like it was almost in some ways hearing that I felt like I
 it's almost like you know there's all kind of statements about what is it that the prophet wrote that
 oh I wish I could remember the exact quote but that like
 one always lives with your Guru the guru always lives with one who's serving their orders or you know remembering them something something like that and he lives with them the other day if I was living with one and a sense I felt like I was in his present I guess that's what it was like
 I was having a hard time putting into words but imagine if there's someone who's very dear and important your life and they passed away
twenty years ago almost 25 years ago and then somehow mystically you were with them again via YouTube it wasn't you too I just listening to it but but through sound yeah that that you could associate with them again and the feeling is just as profound as if they're standing before you it was like that for me and the love that I have for my Guru in my heart was was really
 stimulated by its ToK by it and and in the particular context of his appreciation of Sheila prophet in all the previous acharya's the previous grade teachers in the lineage to hear him speak is one thing I always really admired about him if I say you know I've had different groups in my life you know I'd say two very prominent
 and they teach different things you're so I once I was
is asked to give a talk it was so everyone was pumping pumpkin Hollow Retreat that we used to do in the summer it was and I was asked to speak on my relationship with these two gurus with Charlotte small Krishna goswami with through the Radha soami and what I said was one taught through intolerance and 12 through tolerance right like Radha soami is like incredibly tolerant that's incredibly tolerant and I grew as I can credibly in tolerance for anything that interferes with the carrying out of effective you know the emotional service you know it's risk but I always have I brought your Guru of a glass of water he asked for a glass of wine I brought it to Nico's
 are you kidding me I was like how did I do this for how long after I get this wrong us look at it
because there's water dripping down the sides as like and
 hey guys I'm training you still got money inside I'm actually hit the water still a training you to act as you would act in the spiritual World serving Krishna with complete Focus clear conscience and you're just like not even thinking your work living in a world where you're thinking what you're doing
 yeah if if if Krishna if you're bringing water to Chris you would make sure it was you did to just write what animal killed right
 are you going to force you to like use your brain instead of acting like a just like some mindless kid yeah he got told me that he was training me how to
a good writer and any like horseradish in his right test radish so I went to get it at the supermarket didn't have any right to decide what were the ingredients in horseradish horseradish you see where the ingredients I got the right here goes
 with horseradish I got they didn't have any in have any ghosts are you sure they don't have any cuz yeah I'm sure he goes you stopped you stopped liking the whole world stopped any guys are you positive they had no horseradish
 I realize how much at the time I'm just a Speculator I was like no I just didn't see any horseradish and therefore I didn't ask I didn't go to the front desk when is your horseradish coming do you have any if you actually not have any or I'm at just being lazy and I didn't see any and I just think is good enough and I realized no I'm not absolutely sure and he just stopped and he goes
you're Speculator do you understand you're a Speculator you know he had a way of trying to like her ring out all the disqualification to serve that is within you it was never do that no he wouldn't put you on the spot like that he would ask are you in another way I remember once a similar thing I swear
 I had actually I was a very new devoted new disciple of his and I had arranged for him to come to Atlanta
 to speak to a to a group of dramatized
 so which was kind of like a far-out things like me like affecting his whole schedule and everything it was like a big deal
 and he arrived in the evening and it was very special and it one pointed question came up of his meal I forget the exact thing but what was going on
he says he said he asked about his meal and when we can be ready very specific about his meal and I I said at a certain point I said well you know we can make pores or I was giving an excuse about the cooking and the circumstances something and I mention poor he's excuses and speculation didn't fly with him and poor he's are like you know kind of like a a flatbread that's like deep-fried yeah and and he said and then he got in that mood where she's like going to wring out whatever disqualification is in it right so he said he said how long would it take you to make that it was a challenge because I said it like it wasn't a difficult thing you know and and he said how long would it take you to do that and I just kind of casual like you casually said yeah there's nothing the supermarket I can I cash you said 10 minutes
 have you set your cap for a good luck said okay go
gather the ingredients you know it was like okay go
 and I remember right then there was a lady devotee who is like going to take care of the cooking she just stepped in to save my life. I was about to collapse a complete idiot you know that I would come in like I like 40 minutes later with like a poorly prepared. I'll make those toys in 10 minutes or 5 minutes somehow they're already ready to get his on the thing is with the dough is ready to be rolled out talking about this hearing that hearing his voice and hearing him speak in that context yeah it was feeling just washed all over me and I continue doing it yesterday just even just
like I said I can just ride my bike and plug in those headphones and listen to that and it's just like the other day is we want to be corrected by people who actually care about us you think about tomorrow. He gave me the double barrel shotgun a lot but I always felt loved he also gave me tons of love and it wasn't this weird abusive you know you're you're getting abused by a parent I did never felt that way I always felt that actually loves me you act so you need to call yourself to be part of the family I'm going to help you do that yeah that's what it felt like yeah it in Tripoli a bat age of my life 22 years old that's what I needed I needed it a father to be on top of me and sand down my rough edges and big time they have time
going to be corrected we want to be corrected by people who care about us and it's right we live for that otherwise we never would ever grow we want to become capable of Christmas of service to Krishna what time cuz this all started for me talking about the joy of listening to siddhanta prabhu's remembrances of sure the Power Pod which is wonderful go to YouTube and listen to it today on your down time I listen to
 emunah Sister yesterday Jana Ki jaane KI but joyful things to say about it. Here we go or not getting out of here, then I listen to Swami's drive and text mommy's it was so good what about your people
criticize like these leaders within like to make mistakes and even certain leaders became very corrupted in different ways that may be there yeah but so many but even then
 you know it's okay they fell victim to tell losing it and what does speak of these great Souls who really didn't to just really gave their lives entirely and their people whose minds are just so prone to find out to criticise criticize it cuz it makes them because it has a psychological effect which makes them feel righteous and I would like a warrior for truth or something like that it's it's so sad the sick all right let's go into the box on the right now in the most Christian that I'm sure that I wrote them David some to do before he started my jog what time which is every means of Conquest bunch of operates pecola base and see if the Supreme Lord Narayan unto
Henry see the Super Bowl human being and two others are swapped to the goddess of learning disability Assa Dave the author not stop radiation about racial Nature Box Theater Bubba can I sticky the regular attend some classes in the Bog of Tom and by rendering Services of your devotees all that is troublesome to your heart and loving service to the Supreme Lord we praise we transmit the songs will be established as an irrevocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge base and seized after Lotus feet I love this entire culture were part of what I do I really do love everything about it until I saw the video that you posted
 that customary goswami was speaking about about the
the man that dresses up like Lord Shiva and comes to the festival in Korea if you missed our Monday interview with Chris tomorrow at goswami he talked about a local man who has his service reenacts the past I'm addressing like Shiba and tries to get in to see Krishna mother your soda would chase them away and then finally Christian everytime I get chased away Christian would cry
 and then they realize that this man who's coming to the temples actually Lord Shiva so this local man every year dresses like Shiva and accept past I'm not being allowed cuz because Kristen's mother has got snakes all over him and show him the price again it looks so crazy but I know that story it's such a beautiful
open and I sent it to go stupid I said this is my retirement fund in OKC. You look like a very joyful man didn't he is beautiful I love this culture goddesses and reenact pastimes okay we're on Canta 7 chapter 15 text 40 + 49
 quick a quick recap liquor store in his wrapping everything up Narda and speaking to you just your headset he sang essentially there to pass to life and even to pass given in The Vedic literature you're pursuing
 materialistic gratification and that's called property right prover t-pro materialistic engagement
the other path is called nivruti anti and materialistic engagement to the property because
 this is a path of Pious way to pursue materialism which will help you take a step forward now we're going to hear about that property Mark the path of materialistic engagement materialistic in a healthy way but in it somebody the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifice is known as ugly hotra fire sacrificing or the darsha yagya.
 Oh okay I thought you were Moss the full month Yaya write for months by the Soma as the moon sacrifice or all symptoms
by the killing of animals in the burning of many valuables especially foodgrains all for the Fulfillment of the material desires and creation of anxiety that they did that all over the world to they've always sacrificed animals and all that is always there something like this or something like this religion must have been one at one time or passed around the world cuz you hear about South America this happening in the Middle East with this was happening there in the Bible yeah
 okay performing such sacrifices worshipping Vice by Dave and Performing the ceremony of belly piranha which all supposedly constitute the goal of life as well as constructing temples for demigods building resting houses and Gardens works are coming up right you take a while so there's like a public
drinking fountain we need that right Garden where people can sit in peace for the establishing booths for distribution of food a booth and Performing activities and public welfare these are all symptoms caused by attachment to material desires okay doing good to get a good result exactly why I want to enjoy this material world in my path for doing that efficiently
 ineffectively is to be good in this world do the rituals that expressed gratitude towards the gods I'll give of my well so that I'll receive even more back I got a ten times back in the next life of a teenager that does something like hey Dad I cleaned out the car for you thank you and your tires looks pretty nice thanks a lot and I vacuumed out the trunk too
appreciate that he's like can I borrow the car Dad right it's like I'm doing some work I'm doing some stuff but I want something to return it's not fully voice somebody volved it seemed like you didn't leave the money on the car from you try to get the money through satisfying you through action that's why it's called the past that, he did actions to get reactions sometimes there's like kids let's stay with his teenage example sometimes you could have just like what I can't use the car what what's a big deal to our car know it's my car can I allow you to use it it's my insurance I paid for the main in Taipei for the gas stuff like that so when you're just taking it upon yourself that's full-blown materialism when you're playing this bartering game with the higher authority that's called karma yoga I got a really nice one the other day my son called me on John Marston he's like hey Dad happy job nice to me first thing in my mind was what is this kid want which I don't mind
haven't you must be happy. What are you doing tomorrow that little conversation as I can I get you something you need something to goes I just wanted to say happy John miles to me and I was like that's the right thing without any ulterior motive okay so yes and so we might hear this versus a you-know-what not only have I never heard of any of these rituals I never going to perform it is this at all relevant to me
 but the fact is is very relevant nardis speaking to someone within the context of the beta culture and he's pointing out as courses as of yesterday frame in this so that we will not misunderstand his broader message across all the way to kill literature that what's taught in the early Vedas right through the four Vedas about what's that's called the karmic under the karma division of Yasir Dave's works
that deal with do good work get good pleasing results enjoy the world he's saying that that leads to anxiety
 and we may not be doing all these rituals but we may have that attitude if our attitude is that the goal of this life is to enjoy the things of this world and let me perform action so that I get the right results for the enjoyment of this world that that is a Formula that is a recipe for anxiety it does not deliver he's saying that the depravity Mark will not deliver is trying to get it weathers to the detailed Vedic presentation or just are totally loose Western adaptation or Western Adam good things should be good do good be good you know it's all got to be tied in with bhakti or else it's just good in the material world you'll get some good result
lose that result yeah yeah I'll try to read 12 please to 50 and 51 yd or can you just hear what oblation is of ghee and food grains like barley and sesame are offering the sacrifice they turn into Celestial smoke with carries 12 successively higher planetary systems like the kingdoms of do ma03 Krishna paksha sheenam and ultimately the Moon the Moon the moon's of Heaven that's what they say there's kind of a metaphor being used to that like okay there's smoke when you do this rich in a sense that smoke is you see the Smoke Rise in a sense we will rise also to these high or planetary my toes were great enjoyment will be there if we make this life a life where we engaged to sacrifice I gave that whole analogy of like okay I've got more money and I got a bigger house and I got a nicer car and I got a bigger house again and I change my neighborhood
it's even bigger and now I'm getting a boat and now I'm getting another car and then I'm going to get a motorcycle and it it it it just keeps expanding but guess what it expands for one who knows and one is a little bit more metaphysically incline it explains the higher planets and the Beta start this whole thing where you can expand this the higher planets think I'm tired of refined sense of gratification you know okay of property Mart
 I'm trying to enjoy the material as you're saying it's always expanding where's the path of Liberty mark means on the materialistic level reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing right it's it's it's very interesting
 okay I wonder how much sense of gratification can you like what's the address
what is it like cuz we've only had really dull grow sense gratification that ends like in material sex like okay that's it that's the highest what is it what's the saying that the beauty of the women in the heaven that Heavenly damsels it must be all he likes right makes the most beautiful women of the earth appear like frogs what does it have to be with a man give you one example of what is that mean they all love you all all these Heavenly damsels like love me or like how they want me is what is at the sense gratification of this world is women
 what is your strength
 no but like I said
what is the matter with this guy mirror
 take a deep breath.
 They said they'll be coming to the Krishna Consciousness even your son stratification is better like we eat in such incredible foodz I from different cultures around India where you get these like refined people cooking of these boots are never right there I've never tasted anything like this and then you have like some Sublime happiness I was like where is it go from here for the census
 Costa bird women what you need to have senses that are capable of experiencing more and then
can experience the more subtle body of ultimate laid some type of mental concoction anyway since it is like hear music like you know we might hear some music and then you go to like sometimes people go to a concert of a band that just like that band means everything to them in them and they hear that music music is so elated that the guy that was the best moment of my life like that right there or musicians in the band where your grooving like a drum circle you're just sort of dancing that could be sort of it something you could be but you know what I'm saying what I'm saying is let's say someone does that here on the Earth a planet we go to the Coldplay concert or whatever it is right and then we're like what this is but that would appear
just totally pale
 compare to the experience that you would hear when you heard the music of the gandharvas in the heavens that you feel like such a Sublime musical experience that you just could not put it into words and it just would be a feeling of joy
 I did that would that would just make all the things of this world seem variance and it would be like almost like stepping out of like a black and white World until full you know multicolored Sensational kind of experience to something way way way way VIA however the performers of sacrifice descend again to Earth meaning
 you come down from it you come down from the high but I were talking about going to the heavens but then you come down then however the performance of the sacrifice to send again to the Earth to become absorbed
creepers vegetables and food grains these are eaten by different living entities and turned into semen which is injected into email bodies what
 pull yourself together
