Yoga
 rich
 alright I love you yes I do sir when you observe your mind this is a nugget from. Yes it is I'm a the shop and you took it from my message board
you know it sounds like an Eckhart Tolle Eckhart all I think is really how your pecker totally I think it's how you know it's not all
 but anyway a lot of people say stuff like this but I just thought it was worth talking about I'm claiming all Anonymous quotes you can do that I don't know if anyone else is going to buy into it though they will once I put my name on to it and post it it's mine and then people are going to start saying that rock enough said that when you observe your mind you become aware not only of the thought
 but also of yourself
 and the witness of the thought
 right yeah you know when I was when I was a brand-new devotees someone said I asked the question how do you know you're not your mind cuz Greeks would say the mind is the self yeah are you sure at least some I'm sure there were
lot of Greeks that means a lot of creeps out there
 Rutherford I knew that was going to happen
 see if you got them
 sorry we lost forever but yeah so let's let's let's take a look at this song again I'm back I've been here you were frozen totally froze out alright the idea was that a lot of a lot of Greeks I don't know who the school of Greek thought was the self or the soul is the mind so I asked a question of us need to go see how do you know you're not the mind and the answer that was because you can observe your mind you can change your mind your mind can be depressed and then you can say you know what no I'm not going to I have so many good things going on my life I'm going to I'm going to flip my mind so there's an i
play the noticing we say the eye is the self the mind is a thing that I have is that tangible like my beard or my ear but it's tangible I can I can observe it by just seeing how my mind felt yesterday or have my mind feels now and I woke up or how my mind feels you know when I when I'm sad
 so what's an observable thing in a lot of ways and because of that I can I can sense myself as distinct from it and that is a big
 that could really help you when you feel like you know what I'm not these thoughts I'm not my mind and I'm not going to let Pete's lot and sometimes I thought want us thoughts become we've started thinking I am depressed I am sad or I've been I've been condemned now that I know those are your thoughts
and you can change those immediately and that's a practice
 Yeah you know the word that goes around a lot nowadays is mindfulness right and you know people are I guess they use that in different ways but I think in general you could just say mindfulness like the awareness of our internal States as opposed to like being carried by them unaware of them you know like like you said I'm depressed are you depressed or are you
 is your mind currently going through state of depression right and end so that you know if I'm getting if I'm unaware
 of my internal space I'm just being carried by them well that's kind of like the common experience sure the more thoughtful person to mindful person is kind of just observing old depression is passing through my mind 00 excitement is passing through my my
all right on in and it's it's actually very liberating is just saying you know and you can get there anytime you want at any moment just by pausing for a second and asking yourself where is my mind right now and then observing it you know in immediately you're in that mine. Aid and in you in your kind of approaching self-realization you know that you at least on one level you realizing this is me now you know rather than just being dragged by my mind being carried by my mind you don't be my thoughts and then you take it's still different to to the next level you you you be aware of your thoughts you watch your thoughts Observatory
 without even wishing it was different without beer without you no anxiety without you know you just say oh I see that thing over there that mind
 it's depressed right now that are thing over there that mind is bored right now that thing that mine's is
angry right now you know it just and feeling your separateness from it it's it's it's it's a beginning of of being liberated from his power over you yet Laura being upset without judgment because what's going to happen when you're coming compound pain is like I'm depressed I hate myself because I'm depressed this is horrible how I'm depressed in the office when you start getting angry at it don't don't take it personal it's not you it's just like your windows are dirty I'm horrible because my windows are dirty
 there's an out it's not you and now what can we do to tweak it or just observe it what can we do about the notice it when you notice your windows are dirty that's the first step of cleaning the windows don't say anything about cleaning windows by the way okay
 you are you interested or just a little dirty noticed it but I haven't cleaned them
I'm back we had this we had a nugget that was someone's kid came home and told them like what year did they said what you learn in school today on the Tardis said like what if I said like the mind is like a fish bowl or something in your thoughts are the fish are your emotions of the fifth should they're always moving around and it's a lot of something like that Dena and it was like yeah and the parents are. Oh my God schools are like a lot different than they were mine you know it's right what is it why didn't we learn this as children why do we learn that we're not the mind that the mind is something observe that it has he starts the past my daughter be psychologically to be so good for us yeah I'm not angry but my mind is going through state of anger right now that gives me the opportunity to teach it to kind of from that point too kind of understanding and let it go I was out that age of Aquarius
you know I really think because kids grow up with parents they're not in natural even devotees but this is what a communist this, now the Mind where the soul is different than the body of the spirit has given the body the mind is something we can change its observable it's not you and kids grow up with that you don't animals are beings we should respect being it's a whole new generation then it was in the 60s and the 70s hippie is were open to that or alternative people now it's like this is commonplace
 thank you honey thank you
 archery keep it moving then not to get political at all this isn't a political but Trump's vice-president that he just pay
married to Hindu whose name is Usha and he became a vegetarian and they had an Indian wedding
 I thought that was interesting
 okay The Message Board I've just wondering where it came from was like 280 squirrels to say no it was that someone from like Middle America to buy sprezza degree candidates and the other vice presidential candidate is Indian
 outcome of Harris, Harris okay
Baby Alive Lily goes to the squirrel okay I saw the most beautiful little baby squirrel yesterday cuz see what you would have loved it was a baby squirrel just eating something I sat down in the park in the squirrels are coming out I think the people in the park they feed the squirrels outside cuz he's got you're coming up to I didn't have anything to feed them they're coming up to me like expecting something more standoffish standoffish standoffish here okay let's get into a cubed

 Canto 7 chapter 13 test 14 14 or 13 13
 we talked about their 12:13 yesterday but we can read it again as I remember talking about the kaveri river
 one of the Holy rivers of India should woman read that again that's our x 13
song about the kaveri
 test 12 and 13 talk about the kaveri am I looking to the right shaft here where are you today at the are you on the right track around yourself 713-2377 13:12
 so I'm sending we're at 12 on 13 now 12 and 13 or 1 verse not in mine
 Canta 7 chapter 13 text 23
 12:00 that's what's going on I'm looking at 13 chat forget it I was all the way around to fixing my bed it is usually my bad makes me feel better about myself all right once went out touring the universe with some of the
confidential Associates remember we talked about.
 Mara now it's marriage bad thank God it's your guys bad today but everybody's wrong button
 oberammergau
 where are we
 because you was talking about him being fat and
 covered all that
 19 your honor appears learning expert and intelligent in every way we talked about the python man there's a guy there's a bird in like dirt he's got a big belly doesn't look saintly he's like unkempt is laying on the ground yet more a lot more I sees this person to be very saintly most of us won't recognize my saintly we recommended as like a derelict
maybe an alcoholic a drunkard and a homeless person and I'm going to say it anymore in person the person who let you kill a person who raps listen to house music laying on the street I'm here must make them feel much better to be called that house try yes anyway my point is doesn't look the same person who started asking him questions and so now he's saying to this they called the python man your honor appears learn it expert intelligent in every way you can speak very well saying things that are pleasing to the heart cultured person here you see the people in general are engaged in fruit of activities right yet you are lying here in active and it just lying
 how is this guy saintly
Tony continue to serve as the narrator on the saintly person was best question by prolonged Mirage the king of the deities who was captivated by this shower of neck Terry Edwards and I replied to the inquisitive balad Mirage with a smiling face this is what the saintly Brahmin said there's a beautiful prince like Olan he's walking down and he sees the man covered like like like like like laying on the ground that has this Vision starts offering these almost like prayers and appreciation and then this Mansura Smiles laying on the ground and he starts speaking very beautifully here's what he says
 oh best of the demon race right cuz prologue was born a race of demons who is recognized by Advanced and civilized men you are
where are the different stages of life because of your inherent transcendental eyes interest with which you can see a man's character and dust milk clearly the results of acceptance and rejection of things as they are
 say that again
 the tax was talking to a lot of you are aware of the different stages of Life why we just went went through all the different stages of life you're aware of the different stages of life because you because of your inherent Transit until eyes with which you can see a man's character and dust still clearly the results of acceptance and rejection of things as they are you know so in the early in that context 19 show property he said in his commentary that prolonged Maharaj studied the bodily features of the saintly person
 and through the Saints physiognomy is about
monogamy math isn't ugly I think it means like his his bodily
 things you can look on his face he could read his face in there I caught up in her knitting it's not my America
 you should see the selection of shrub Adam scars we have in the gift shop it's quite beautiful the art of discovering temperament and character from outward appearance or an art also the facial features held to show qualities of mine or character by their configuration or expression that is a Vedic signs to face reading ever hear that it's almost like palm reading but you look at her face and the different markings on the face tell you something about the character Monica Spurlock study the violin features of the saintly person this with real property he says in through the same
physiognomy physiology physiognomy let me help you busy talking to me busy Alchemy physiognomy Collide Mirage could understand that he was intelligent and expert although he was lying down not doing anything besides them up and so now this this person is saying you have these in here in transit at the lies you understand who I am everybody else is walking past me and they're thinking I'm a complete idiot that's why I tell you sometimes that you think I'm a complete idiot now that you think I'm an idiot but I'm actually very very busy and you have these you can understand your recognizing who I am because you have these inherent eyes with which you can see a man's character and no and us know clearly the results
of acceptance and rejection of things as they are so this
 he says a devoted by prolonged Mirage can understand the minds of others
 because his pure Vision in devotional service at the volume by prolonged Mirage can understand another man's character without difficulty
 I was thinking that
 you know
 a person that actually does like work through the layers of their mind you know a person that does spend time with the mind and and
 go through all the layers in in in uncover the self you know they're looking at the patterns the mind they're examining the mind looking at the patterns might be serving like we talked about earlier right yeah and when you go through it you kind of begin to understand everything that's asked journal to who you read your true character is and what the false
you know granted we're all like different but in another sense we're kind of all the same sure you know we have the same kind of insecurities and you don't even even the
 the people that are posing and it that made appears the most confident and straw are really struggling with exact same kind of insecurities you know commonly
 I may be responding to them in different ways
 and so a yogi that's examining the mind and depth and then and then kind of conquering it in the sense that like overcoming it and in and then experience their self still be able to look at other people
 it kind of size them up you know even by the look in their face what is speak of their words are the behavior you know so I think A lot's kind of got those kind of eyes you know the eyes of Yogi would have
 they can you know one who's got that
they kind of overcome their own programming and then they come in and so they have a certain Purity you know it's like pure Consciousness and they can recognize up your Consciousness to someone else so prolonged saw him lying on the ground
 he said this guy is not I've met people like this you just say I want to see a picture of the person okay this person's buy some of that kind of thing yeah it's a city council kind of had it sucking on the Swami has I was going to say my girl had it you know that he could size you up so quick it was like a crazy person and I don't want to be around my behalf in my situation all right
 text 22 Ryan the Supreme personality of godhead who is full of opulence is is predominant within the core of your heart because of your being a devotee
these drives away all the darkness of ignorance as the sun drives away the darkness of the universe
 my dear King this is a I'm not going to say slow down thank you how do I how do I express around with you tell me how you should say something like there's an interesting point here look it up if you don't mind before that goes sound condescending Mary Pause
 okay but okay so some interesting stuff here right now Ryan
 who is falling all actions is predominant within the core of your heart right like we all have Narayan and in are the in the in the core Bahama Breeze predominant like your thoughts your feelings your desires are centered around Ryan
the property rights this and then uses this word Buck the a Cable cable I gave a lot you're only bhakti yeah cable music pure right without any mixture of anything complete complete bought these unadulterated bhakti that's what's going on in your heart proper lights only to the devotee does the Lord give instructions always see he said okay let's go back here Narayan
 I was following options is predominate within the core of your heart because of your being a devotee he always drives away all the darkness of ignorance as the sun drives away the darkness of the universe oh you are able to see me you have these in her eyes
 because your heart is just predominated by Lord Narayan
 nnn because of that purity
I am because of his instructions like you can actually hear him right it's like he's there and everyone's heart but it wasn't for dominate everyone's heart he's he asks you have to ask him predominant my heart you have to beg and predominately my heart otherwise our hardest lightest adulterated by so many other desires and fears and ideas and but only one like you clear all that out can you really hear his voice will speak to you and you'll understand I'll look in the face of that man lying on the ground understand though he's no ordinary man you know he's right there in our town assets of prophet racist in the concerts is only to the devotees
 does the Lord give instructions by which to advance further and further in devotional service
 two others
 devotees the Lord gives instructions according to the manner of their surrender
very very interesting
 what do you think we're going to find that it just makes me to the realization I had this morning when she really say she woke up this morning and you know Krishna woke me up do we have this talk conversation was it before the show started before the show started I can't remember yesterday I felt like sometimes I wake up early I was like I want to go back to bed but I was like no Krishna woke me up but I didn't wake you up that looks just like you know a noise woke you up you need some more sleep sleeping and then I get into have started me out and I was like nothing I was Krishna Krishna watch me to get up and start getting the holy name so I was sitting there with my job and I've been struggling with Joppa lately so I'm going to go I'm going to get really focused today and then I started thinking like a twelve-step person where you know if that person sometimes gets so overwhelmed by
defeat that the Himalayan feet up I got to stop alcohol I got to stop whatever the you struggle with in the 12-step program so the same one day at a time one day at a time today
 I will not drink alcohol and then sometimes I'll even say stuff like this hour I will wear this moment right so my thing today was I'm going to I'm not going I'm going to Champ Wunderground today the rest can go but today I will chant one good round and after you do that rag like okay one good one good round that's all you got to do today one good round
 thank you.
okay one good round is not a good way to look at it though it is a good way I think of even has one good Mantra one good Mantra and then the next picture yeah you could
 one good thing about when I try to change out but you see this is why I say clickers really not the same as the Beats I don't have the clicker I'm not clicker you like the clicker you said don't let us know we're talking about if you ever been to a nightclub and they're like there's a the bouncers like licking people so some devotees use these clickers because I don't know maybe they're driving or they're walking around and they don't have a bead bags or they just click click click click click click click click click if you ever see a devotee walk around the clicker that's what they're doing they don't work in the nightclub chanting japa your goal is to get to 17,000 whatever it is it is it 1728 or something like that and I don't even know I don't even know the click click
 you used to do that
I think of it like this cuz it's like one bead
 there's kind of a pause and then the next speed but it is like I think of it like when you chant that munch I think of it like riding the name right
 start writing the Mantra as if you wrote on a chalkboard yeah and you want to ride it is beautifully and nicely as you can some people have good handwriting they can do it really nice there's some devotees who do this write the name of that write the name that is in there I thought I knew a lady who wrote 16 rounds of job at every day as well as Channel 16 rounds wow that's got to take a long time I know and I went into a room and she had like books and books and books of the holy name and then the handwriting and it's a thing it's not going to make it up at the thing she write 16 rounds every day and then she has to eat
can't think of her name right now but the older lady from from chowpatty who helps you get you to take the ladies out to buy sorry I kind of think it starts the pit right I can't remember if she does that crazy I know cuz I wanted to Ruben's house I went to all these books she's like wow that's pretty impressive people there on that were enchanting job I think it's like a chant one inside One Beat is like you're riding the Munch as beautiful as you can on a chalkboard
 then you erase it
 can you do it again with the same concentration right same deep concentration so each bead is like kind of been 16 rounds a long time
maybe one round maybe one rounds even still that would take a long time 64 Rapids okay Lee B team right now I don't know what the tie-in rug another what is what I was talking about was this day even go back to the property that krishna's for the devotee for the one that's eager for for the one that's calling for for the one that has made Krista predominant in their heart by consciously removing everything else clearing out making room for me got to make room for no this one down there make some room for Christian in your heart clear up clear out the Clutter
 it was my brother I like how you're throwing out takeaways Into The Ether call on him and then and then he'll instruct you and so it says you're only a maybe that was it be
Christian woke you up this morning
 so only the devotees only to the devotees does the Lord give instructions by which to advance further and further devotional service if you want to advance further in your spiritual connection to one more time then you do it now he's only he's only giving some people those instructions why won't you give everyone those instructions we shouldn't we all get that uses note to others to the non devotees he gives a whole different set of instructions the others interesting are the non devotees the Lord gives instructions according to the manner of their surrender
 interesting that's what I was saying and he said he and his not only zebras
Trucking and how to pursue them
 that should be on the headlines of the New York Times right now Christian will reciprocate with all your desires does that make you think of a pug and a dumpster dive of a jungle hum mama
 Bart my Bonte minutiae part 2 everyone follows my Pathos and up Rita
 in all respects in all respects so what does that mean and how can everybody be following Christmas Past it's like some people seem to be going one way some people seem to be going another way let us hear the commentary on it rubbing on the commentary of 11:11 thought the pop back quick but
I got it I don't know where you got it I've got it set up tell her you were going to send me up okay I wanted to just discuss this before you go to that this idea
 what what is saying is that
 Christus simultaneously very eager for us to turn to him
 right we hear it we see if I can bring a bag of time Rita yeah Goku Mara this this character he goes to the entire universe and Beyond the university climbs all the different layers of existence in the cosmos and he finally answered back and glow covering diamond and Christian is Leal in the spiritual realm and when Christmas season what did you do right now
 racism is beautiful and Grace Breaking Bad one Embrace Christian the embrace you have you ever read it in that scene
 I never read the breha bog of time Rita
I'm saying that I'm not shaming you I said I just asked you a question is a whole another type of course I had to I had no he's like I had no intention to shame you stream my new name is Josh dersch a boo the book what happens or not this Krishna
 you know when they meet what time it is
 evening I'll tell you if it's a shame you don't know anything about wearing in the thing that you didn't read no but if you turn to your right right look at the wall
just painting right there what was Christian wearing back here my home to we both have the same pain Christian bother I'm returning from from spending the day with the cows and go over downhill hurting the cows this vision is considered the Perfection of the eyes I thought you wanted me to look at me okay I'm with you I'm on your lap right now okay will be on my lap and like paying attention to me you'd rather than like everything else, so go Kumar you know he's climbed all the devotee of Krishnan that's going through all the scar on such a journey such a journey through the cosmos and now he's back in Clover. He wakes he appears and glow, David and Chris the first thing he sees is this Perfection of the eyes Krishna
call Rob
 returning home from Government Hill in the evening the sun setting beautiful Sun is setting
 the cows are all behind him in the Cowboys Christmas playing his flute is it's the most beautiful the gopis they cherish this Vision they wait all day every day for Christian to return so they can catch a glimpse of him
 it's just it's an eternal Lila that goes on that just drowns the residence of a diving in the ocean of bliss to see this Vision in Kokomo to seeing it after such a long journey and and then Krista comes up and Kristen races and speak sweet words to him he wants us to turn back to him you know he's waiting not only that run with them what happens here with me
 you're Frozen Christian will not reveal it to rug
so then Kristen brace isn't right did you hear me up so so so he sees his vision Goku Marcy's his vision of Kristen returning
 it's the most beautiful Vision imaginable and then Krista comes up and I asked her saying Krishna want he's eager for us to turn to him he's so either he embraced Goku more with the deepest affection spoke the Swedish words to him and he was in such Bliss enjoy so overwhelmed that go Kumar was back that he fainted Christian is painted on the ground and everybody came up like what's going on who's this stranger what did he do to Krishna was honor describe what happens that it's mind-blowing but the point is Krishna is very eager
return to his whole heart is at the same time simultaneously he's very accommodating to our free will to choose not to turn to him
 so he's he He Loves Us on a very deep emotional level it's almost like how to be a good parent his buddies like a very wise parent it is sometimes you see a pair of imposing their love like what are you doing when you coming home are you going to come visit me it's Christmas the time what are you doing Christmas in the kid hitting you you don't love me but you don't love me it's like you want to be intimately connected with me I'm here for you but if you want to do your own thing that's okay to like to the point of you never have to call me if you don't want to call me don't ever have to call me if you want to call me yeah and we can develop this relationship deeper and deeper in deep cuz he understand in what
Real Love is a can't be pushed you know what we should write the Krishna conscious book of how to deal with teenagers and like completely parallel to Krishna and the devotees in Maya wanting to return home to Krishna perfect parallel world for the abrahamic Western mine to understand why because we're used to the jealous God who gives you one chance to submit and then he's going to condemn you for ever for the cinemas directing your affections that's horrible I don't want to think of God like that if you want to enjoy my energy
 without me in the picture
 okay
 an abrahamic version also it's it's it's like and there's a
stop running and you got to do it before you die I'm a drunk I'm alcoholic I get into Christ or Allah and then all of a sudden I fall back into my my get back in the drinking and living like a sloth and then I'll just get a second but the whole thing is ticking ticking ticking till the time of death is a game show Beat the Clock it's like Beat the Clock sorry you lost go to hell you lost eternally wait a second
 as I know you had your chance you had your chance you had your at 58th or 48th or 38th why does he get 98 years to beat the clock and I got 38 years doesn't matter if she's 8 years old and 8 years to beat the clock even know about the clock
it's a very good now so we're talking about these two facets of Krishna on the one hand he's detached and if you're saying I want to enjoy your energy without you don't call don't text leave me alone I want to wander around in your world of energy give me the car I want to take off for the house and he said okay I will I will I will even instruct you how to do that from within the heart but there's the other side of this and come back I'm ready I'm waiting for you waiting here patiently and it means a lot to me now sorry girl he just shared from the bring a bag with some Rita and one more shot her throughout he's so you didn't try to look at your to check this out he says Krishna said to go for Kumar
oh now I understand and I read this nice room is important Krishna set to Global Kumar when they met why did you stay away to contact just to make sure people understand what we're eating here go Kumar is a character in the book three head Bob with him Rita who's searching for the love of his hearty searching for the god of his heart any searching on Earth then he moves up to the higher planetary systems in the universe at every step he's going to like all kinds of things you know then it goes up into the higher your volume dropped this to everyone saying your volume drop him speak a little louder maybe he goes to the different layers of the spiritual realm he even guessed at work and he sees Chris and he's like
 so good but it's still not right he needs to be in Randolph and we're Christians love with the greys
Tennessee so after he takes the role of Indra takes the role of her mama like this was a very long journey that he took together
 and right now he arrives he sees Krishna come with the cows Christian braces and faints comes back up and then starts to say this to let me read it check your mic because people are still saying it's bad Christian said to go become are when they met stay away why have you been lit imagine yourself going back to the spiritual realm for the first time face to parking you smells really good when he hugs you to me so I can imagine it's like they don't smell well they don't smell good they smell like them and it smells good
Krishna Krishna saying to you
 Abu why did you stay away
 why have you been living away from home for so long how is it possible for you how could you bear my separation
 you left me and you have been passing lives after lives without me that wasn't killed that was just love and do not listen how he scares a little bit here still I know that trouble you took to return to me I know the trouble you took that returned to me you searched for me everywhere and went to bag from house to house and you were chastised by many ridiculed by many you shed tears for me I know all these things I was with you and now after great trouble you have again
come back to me oh my God my beautiful read it everyday right now boo it's one of these things like it is like the Fibonacci spiral of the mother and a teenager it's like you can move out sometimes a kid moves out prematurely when they're sixteen or when a 14 or something like that and the parents you know you want to love you want respect but finally they have to do what they have to do and you can but there are hardships and sometimes there's real hardships and sometimes it takes some make some really bad choices and that's us in the material world sometimes you make some good choices
 successful and sometimes we're on the streets but Krishna is patiently waiting for us to refine and perfect our.
and then the whole thing seems like a dream and Krishna you know what scripture does he looks you in the eye he holds you by the hand and he says we'll come back out we never got to the point that it will get there we'll we'll pick up next Monday everybody chair in the paintings of it now thank you
 it's a beautiful painting both of them look at that painting that Ben yavilah put up on the board name of Lutheran me my shared
 and then there's been nothing but pain. How dare you put water in my
so it's a tearjerker
