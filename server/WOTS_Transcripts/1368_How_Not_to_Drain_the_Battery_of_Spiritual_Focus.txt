 all magana to Miranda Co Op metal base and sees at their load of speed reading for the srimad bhagavatam Canto 7 chapter 13
seven right now what's going on here
 are you going to wear with hotspot on
 I mean what's going on in the Bog of town it was from the Bible's have no idea what they should I do have a dress if you haven't talked about what they don't talk about a walk we also heard about the realizations yesterday right that they're the mood in the insights that they were cultivating yeah what all these regulations have been for that was to see Christian providing everything and to become very peaceful in mind to become the friend of everyone to find your happiness within but now we're going to go back like this which can go a little bit of back to what they're not supposed to do so that they can have that kind of peaceful mind and in you know we should keep in mind that
 these are instructions Memphis in yossi's right the final stage of
you wander with me you've done all your social responsibility so I don't want to hear any arguments about what what about being socially responsible they've done that their whole life that they're in this is socially responsible because if we need some people wandering around with Heather totally clear that can tell us some stories and give us some perspective you know to sing us a little song 6:00 your time with family okay well I said we travel along singing a song but something's always happen whenever we were together I don't even know I was feeling happy when we're saying and it's all okay it's not exactly that but he was more what they need not to do it
music
 is that yes this is first in Yahtzee and no we're not all meant exactly follow these regulations but
 a lot of them to apply or or we have to take the essence of them and apply them in a way that's appropriate in our stage of Life yeah there's some basic archetypes out there but it may not be your your life exactly we're taking the essence we hear from it and hero that's the archetype how can I apply this to my life
 yeah I was going to text seven literature that is useless waste of time and it would know what type of literature that is plenty of it out there plenty of it out there literally right cuz sometimes you'll just say read just read reading is good for you reading is fundamental
 that was that was a
phrase there was pushing number that reading is fundamental
 raise mental reading can be Tomasek
 now we're jocic tommaso jocic Tomasek
 and septic literature accidental that is useless waste of time and other words literature without spiritual benefit should be rejected
 what you not become a professional teacher as a means of earning a livelihood oh no I hope the owners out there listening as a teacher who was again this is forcing these professional the meaning of spiritual teacher professional it doesn't say teacher in the first proposed, adding that in there cuz I think he's thinking that she might be prone to that
 okay
 nor should one indulgent argument
and counter-arguments point-counterpoint it's almost like more
 relevant today then is previously get online and gets sucked in that Whirlpool of arguing with people on Facebook even among spiritualist is ridiculous Facebook is over it's Dad it's just like I'm not going to do that anymore go back and forth if it needs to it's ridiculous what that that's what you just said okay no one should take shelter of any cause or faction in or should one Nordstrom's nor should one take shelter Vinny pause or faction okay so three things here are mentioned that the sea on C should not engage in these are things you know how much time left in this life
 has as you know worn down to a
power window and I'm very Focus out all all mine
 social responsibilities have been met my kids are raised in my wife's been taking care of my you know whatever I was I was I was trying to do something good for the world through my occupation maybe I was a doctor in and I gave my life to caring for the health of others may be in whatever that occupation was I contributed to society and Society has collectively
 giving me the green light you know to say okay now you go for it right now now you start really you know a lot of our practice in this world spiritually it means I have we need to have one foot in the spiritual realm I need to be thinking of my fundamental
 nature my maternal spiritual nature what's beyond all this temporary game that we're living in but I've also had one foot in the temporary game you know
being responsible and end in that room now we're saying start to take that foot out of out of the temporal realm and start to situate your Consciousness deeply in the Eternal realm start to let go of things in and the here's was going to help you do that just stop reading stuff that's you know books that are on the terms for all three things that he said okay cuz I think there's some really wish we had a Assassin's Creed correspondent with us on it on the day of your calling maybe you should start studying take 12 years to really get it down and you don't have many probably but first it says I might have less than you and it could go either way the interesting one of your mother's like 90
 77 right now but I don't think we go by her mother's side Dewey with death
 I sure enough
well you've already you've already lived much longer than your father so it seems like you're going to have it my probably. I'll text you before his father died at 60 you're such a big family and you're on the youngest kids all right okay okay first one is asset shastri shoe
 okay temporary literature true or a sub but yeah but I also like to look at that way any books shastras and he's any books on in permanent subjects the asset be good books but now at this phase of your life especially at this season of your life now drill into the Eternal truths okay then and then we could go on and on about that but but I think the third one is the one that we we probably should fluff out the most but then the next one was
it's it's his Nepal Nepal bhaji beta jeeva kannan NAPA NAPA gva to Geva come now property out of this thing about
 Ernie said earning a living as a teacher cuz I think it might be natural that ass in Yahtzee go that route
 but really if I'm understanding correctly like gevo you know was referring to life
 Napa gva2 jeeva jeeva, don't live by making a living I think is if I understand it right that's what it's saying you know don't live by making a living like another words
 don't maintain yourself by an occupation anymore
 how are you going to get fed how are you going to find shelter that is going to come to you and we're about to hear the story about to break into the story about the python man you going to Taylor's trade all this
 so so that's all so you know making a living in this world going out finding an employer starting a business to all these different things even being a teacher
taking time to students taking on all of their you know Bike by taking them out of your student take on responsibility take on a lot of their energy
 you maybe you've done that already in your life now you're going to not even worried about any of that doing there that there is that final stage of Sydney Oscar they give up the students in the ostrom's and they leave even that as well I guess this is where I think I've seen the post like GBA to Geva, don't make a living don't live by making a living and the next one is wahda wahda wahda wahda wahda wahda Dums
 Vada
 dahi Vada Vada breakfast time anyone that doesn't know what is a vodka or what and what a little Savory donut kind of thing
yeah dude Savory Donuts South Indian Delight so good on the right right yeah okay so vitamins like a thesis or proposition or the argument or doctrine my evado and sovata vitamins at the end this is just me trying to extrapolate with my lack of Sanskrit grammar but it's I think it may be saying like don't be an argue or of arguments until you have the GPA to Geva, you got the Bottom Bottoms that that we shouldn't be caught up in the tenancy there's
 there's a tendency in US sometimes the most intelligent people often times off to you as your ego as well to should give a great intelligence I give you great looks or if you have great wealth that manifest in your ego great
teligence also we see this in all circles doesn't have to be political circles doesn't have to be you know within what Subs on the hobby or in like mixed martial arts or art or music critics but you see it. Where you be at least think we'd see it which is spiritual circles and they argue over like some technical detail raging arguments like offending others in the process like missing the forest from the trees like so I'm always shocked by it and if you look at it and is this happens now on Facebook or on comments of sometimes YouTube lectures or something like that or
 you want to get sucked into it and you just can't go there you just can't go there because you risk making an offense
and often times it's not the platform to have a philosophical discussion anyway on social media important but it is part of a so problematic about offending each other others or even if you do it in a way that's not exactly offending another but the way that it absorbs your mind the loops that it'll put your mind through
 there's no point is it's like it's taking all of this it's sucking your energy sucking your battery of like spiritual focus and a big-time way he can do it in such a powerful way it so it's really is the argumentative attitude that one really has to guard against for-profit shares this in the commentary says one should not concern myself with the conclusions of various logicians and philosophers of course as soon as the state of course those who preach you know like there's something good to do
sharing the teachings of bhakti it's a philosophy its counters other philosophies and other philosophies attempt to counter it so probably best he's he's saying there's of course for those who preach sometimes the need to argue with the contentions of opponents but as much as possible once you to void the argumentative attitude it's also sharpening your when you're like debating someone on spiritual topics like you're debating in an atheist and agnostic or something first of all it doesn't have to be a debate it can be a discussion second of all its sharpens your spiritual intelligence and it helps you understand the difference between spirit and matter and sometimes I remember as a new devotee sometimes you'd meet someone who's a little bit more intelligent than you and they bring up a point like I'm I never thought about that that's actually a good point and then you'd bring that back to someone who has a little bit better understanding of the philosophy and you're like now I get that
because I think it's important in our early stages of bhakti is today you and to argue just to play around and and and feel this philosophy out and it tests the pressure that the world will put on in your own doubts will put on it we have to get rid of all our doubts by going through every little nook and cranny of the philosophy and there's certain things that you might have enough faith in that you'll say you know what I don't get this but I'm going to put it on hold for now because I do get the substantial amount of it this is making me move forward in small steps powered thinking like David Hume
 damn who says truth Springs from argument amongst friends argument without the argumentative attitude right it's like we're not trying to tear each other down
we're taking an idea and it kind of is you say we're testing it together right you know it's it's a beautiful word how I put friend because oftentimes you'll see these YouTube clips of Ben Shapiro brushes woke student you know what I mean like that like the blasted him that he blasted him it's like we don't want to blast people we don't want to rush them we wouldn't we want them to when they walk away from that we want to be like I feel enlightened now and there's no delicate way to do that where you can actually win win the debate so to speak but empower the other person is from Deep humility you are thinking like Sydney J Harris
 is Sydney J Harris do I have no idea who it is
says I've got this ready I am so ready for Sydney the most important thing in an argument next to being right is to leave an escape hatch for your opponent so that he can gracefully swing over to your side without too much apparent loss of face sure interesting right is arguing with out the argumentative attitude yeah but you know what you say or not it's funny because sometimes I'll I'll I'll click on one of those you know like Ben Shapiro is walks sometimes he does demolish them but you know this is the thing a person change to that person be like that touched my heart but but even so sometimes I actually see nobody got crushed at all like that was a really good conversation is like a human who ever made the thumbnail and the title just is
putting the clickbait there because they think that that's what people want even they got something better than that and you didn't advertise it that way because you know people have Minds where they just want to see you. How is intelligent conversation back and forth on your chart Saint Rita the biography of Sri chaitanya that also lays out in such you know I've obviously been listening to some audible books are going there on some Monk
 that's down the road right now. That was got it download it
 chaitanya charge Marissa Avila
 okay is it free or you going to pay for it on Audible it was a gift I don't know if you have to pay for
I listen to YouTube and listen to treat on your blog about in YouTube all the time and cuz I got YouTube premium I download it so I can listen to take Tanya back about all the time now. It is so good and even you can listen to it you can listen to while you're riding the bike because it's not like listening to music and you can't hear anything it's like so I'm listening to cheat on you charge me to do that now Audie Lila
 it's a lot of technical stuff I know I stood truthfully I really was too much for me nobody recognized go back again go back again went when I was back when a long time ago is a barometer is like 19
 90
 two or something like that I read the entire cheat on your charging return is Summer right I was living in this cabin going out and do my
service in in in the mornings and I have a lot of time to read I read the whole sheet on each artery to which is 17 volumes you know back when your books around with you but I don't think I've read it through since then you know I've certainly read from you yeah but going through it now and and you know like I ever see those memes where like they show that
 the comedian with a big beard Zach Galifianakis in it either like him and he's thinking and like all of the calculations yes I'm here and commentaries and it's like all this stuff is just exploding my head is like a leaking more sense now everything is making perfect sense in the depth in the the Brilliance of Sheila prophet in it's really the Brilliance of Shield prop presenting the Brilliance of the six goswami is in a
Christmas card goes for me is how these brilliant thinkers presented vedanta is just so masterful so you're saying that if this season of your life what you read in a 30 years ago it was just too hard to digest even though you've read it and you had faith in it you went forward with your life but it's but it's better now. Making more sense and there are books are AR books that I've read 30 years ago I was like you know what I don't get this one I'm just going to put it on the shelf that looks like that and I got a feeling if I go back to breed them now they'll be a whole different accidents and that's exactly what happened around and it's like alluding to something like I know exactly what he's a Looney Tune out everything spinning together you know so like before I was understanding it and getting my Foundation
 now I feel like I'm understanding on a whole nother level and it is it's giving me the bill
to maybe to explain it more deeply but there's an argument in the chase on your charts and Rita Avila very important argument we're in the did the Dynamics that we're discussing here become really play out and that's the argument between SRI chaitanya and thus the my body synopsis in Varanasi prakashananda saraswoti sometimes we see buckie always getting really caught up in this people like takes your profile very multifaceted person but leave it on the Swami
 he's got many sides to him he's got the heart of the Thunderbolts side he's got the sauce has a rose side he's got the you know that the de super conservative side he's got the very liberal side you know
I was on a I spoke on the spindle panel yesterday at at least a great time in grade five teachers K through 12 most of my high school teachers who were presenting religion you know in their in their classrooms it it's open to K through 12 teachers okay and and they come for a three-week interface immersion they come to New York City from all over the country and in the comfort Interfaith immersion in and they bring on a take them to different temples and churches and synagogues Etc mosques and they bring in different panels and different speakers to present all the different world religions were there
 are there great I mean it is an Interfaith thing so people are coming with a certain openness open mind do you get paid I did get paid
send a message to let you know I would have done it if I didn't get paid in the cic might accept that donation but they're not getting them they're not you know and then they would maybe even give it away you know or whatever but in any case you're supposed to give it to the sunniest okay so why did I bring that up what we talkin about your help up there and help you just said something so it's something understanding things that conversation between the senior season
 I forgot to point out that way it'll come back up it'll come back I'll let me let it go back to this conversation with my buddy cianci's
such a fashion, it all came back good so we're talkin about property to Malta faster the person he's got this conservative side he's he's proper often speaks on the level of promoting traditional gender roles he definitely does that right sure and and that's the kind of thing that a lot of people don't even want to hear that like even you begin to talk like that that you've been rejected and I don't even want to hear anything else you have to say yeah but we also saw him probably his life he kind of broke gender roles and broke Hindu tradition or expanded it or whatever you want to say because one person asked in and there's a whole panel of Hindu people
 one person asked our women are there any Hindu groups are women allowed to become priests and write down the road no no no no no and they were saying but they can do this and they can do that but when it came to me and said she'll probably Pie when he brought the teacher
bat eBay Toronto to do you know to the Western world and it you know not only I said your question could be made more broad the question is not just can women be brahmanist can people not born in Hindu Family Promise can people not born in Brahman of families become Brahman is all of those are controversial subjects within the Hindu tradition drop I broke them all or Yvonne call bro he went to the sacred texts and found that these Traditions are not essential and actually that each of something far more Central that these things are based on someone's marriage based on one's quality is based on one's Behavior
 and interpretations are meant to serve a higher purpose sure that's why we have Traditions but my point was I was apparently profit is so conservative but I was the only one sitting in the saying yes in the international Society for Krishna Consciousness propagate Brahmin initiation he ordained women priests which is you know
other groups of property I want says he's very concerned I know since he sits radical you know what I want to say was according to our mindsets we appreciate different facets of Shield probhud some people
 what they love about problem is his abrasive
 attacking argumentative side
 you know they did they take a thrilling that and in almost like that's all they see is like that was kind of like a small part of what he was but like there's so much more crucial problem was and how he dealt with people
 and in this conversation was SRI chaitanya when he speaking to these synopsis The my body synopsis in one sense this is the greatest philosophical opponent of Krishna bhakti and it's a debate that's been going on for centuries
but when she cheat on you and then we get Krishna himself to, demonstrate how to deal with it
 and went straight to Tiny spoke to the my body so nice if he was not argumentative at all he was practically the my buddies had to pull out of him
 why do you do the things you do do they eat in walk in there and bust up their meeting and said you're all a bunch of idiots and you know he just did is kirtan in there like your ass in Yahtzee
 but you don't comment and studied the vedanta sutras with us and you sing these songs dancing like you are a Sentimental materialist we don't get it and then he began to speak and he spoke to them with sweet words and he spoke to them with humility you know my group called me a fool what do I know
 you know I'm glad he explained vedanta to me in this way
and they all became so touched by the way that he spoke and I was hearing this at through the cheats on your charger with you through here in this audible sheet on each other right now I just want to draw attention to one point of that and if there's a verse out of a Lila to Tony Chargin read a chapter 7 text 99
 so that after hearing Lord Street to 20 mph all the my very soon as he's removed their minds were changed and that's they spoke with pleasing words this is where argument is meant to go right like someone can actually change
 I usually nobody changes even if it woke student gets smashed and walks away unchanged in a large part because of the way that it was done so already cuz the person was out to smash them out to crush them put in the commentary to this property rights and in this is how much it take to hard he says the original purpose of the my buddy cianci's
Banaras Varanasi and meeting with your 10 your mama people was to defeat his personal conception of God
 she just sent him a Happy Poo however as a preacher turn the minds of the my buddy cianci's they were melted
 are the sweet words of should you take a Whopper bun and that's became friendly and spoke to him also and sweet words not for now probably going to bring this home is going to say simerly all preachers will have to meet opponents but they should not make them more and then we'll call they are already enemies here human enemies of Krishna right they were enemies of the conception that God has a personal form they were already enemies and if we talked with them harshly or impolitely
 they're empty will merely increase we should never follow in the footsteps of loyalty to the makapuu enjoy each other's happy with start with bowling by the Sharia we saw this happen with the digvijay you know if these people are coming
I'm going to educate you right and how did he do it he sat with Starbuck going to go to try said nothing cuz he have 7 days and then why are you answering asking a question because it is very gently and very sweetly dissected everything cuz said it back to him
 and same thing with with the degree dry Pond it. You just said I will I don't know anything I'm just a child just you please you please find Mother ganga glorify mother gun that he whipped off 100 vs. glorifying mother ganga everyone was shocked and learn cheat on with his genius
 listen to 100 versus kicked out the tiny little faults thing credible it we are also impressed you did screw up
here and he liked the fact that he could remember the little detailed mess up right by the digvijaya it was like it made made the dickweed I realize this person's actually really isn't the time I'm actually defeated the fact that he could remember a nuanced detail of 100 versus that just came out of my mouth
 and correct him and show where he was off now it was impressive he didn't embarrass him I mean he felt embarrassed you had a hard day tomorrow night you is and you know what this reminds me of these before but I think it's important because again we need to guard against this argumentative attitude right we met if there's nothing wrong and in the exchange of ideas and putting ideas to the test through argument right but it's the argumentative attitude that's going to suck our battery
not allow our minds to have those space that it needs I think this might be crazy or directly talking to you today okay you don't argue don't argue with what I just said so these are around there called the four steps to arguing intelligently
 from Daniel C Dennett I think he's like a contemporary philosopher someone contemporary
 how to compose a successful critic critical commentary I had to argue with someone
 and this is the one that I think is most maybe most important it's so good
 you should attempt to Rick's press your targets position so clearly
 vividly
and fairly
 that your target says thanks I wish I thought of putting it that way
 this is how you have this is how two people can have a constructive argument right you don't eat a lot of these arguments they're not even trying to defeat the person's point they're just trying to defeat the person ever so they sold their strawman arguments are never getting to the the the Central Point that's being argued but let me express to you your belief
 illustrate to that I understood exactly what it is that you're arguing for if we each just did that we would understand each other so much better you know let me in and that's going to require something that we don't always like to do listening not using name calling asking some questions that aren't hostile but our two men to help deepen your understanding your position that they
so you should attempt to repress your targets position so clearly and vividly
 I am fairly fairly that your target is thank you I wish I was able to explain it as well as you suggested you should list any points of agreement especially if they're not matters of general or widespread agreement okay this is what we agree on what words were saying on the same ground as far as this goes in that goes in this other thing of our only the screen is on this point you should mention anything that you have learned from your target okay I didn't know that that that's what you believe before that's you know what that makes things more clear now is that what we talked about and only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism
 I like it all right on it so we did we got three things in that verse
that we're not getting our mind caught up in in permanent subject books books just not send for us it means more than books nowadays write a lot more often times more than not its other types of media that were downloading into our brain we don't have the patience of the books in the nation for book we're going to look back at a time when people used to read
 all right and then the senior she's not making a living by making a living and he's also not becoming an argument of arguments next text Sonia she was not present allurements of material benefits to gather disciples Nora Nora should unnecessarily read many books or give discourse as a means of livelihood you must never attempt to increase material opulence has necessarily unnecessarily
more things right you more things alluring disciples
 what's the percent of lower men sperm that are benefits to gather many disciples were you can get Rich's you can make things appear out of your hands probably talks about this gold gold or I suppose you're all kind of alarm is set for the city a city in India that has shown such respect
 that it's not too difficult maybe they kind of get your following is not interested in that there's no I'm not trying to squeeze some enjoyment about being seen as the big lie spiritual leader no interest in that unnecessarily read many books are give discourses you know the truth is simple. We don't need to I was I saw an interview were saying it was a devotee
 they had some brilliant insights
 in a
some really brilliant insights but I also felt
 that they were trying to impress the Audience by how much they knew you know any kind of just for me it was just kind of like taking the essential thing of this person really had to offer it was almost like I had to dig through a lot of stuff to get it you know I could have easily not listen to the whole thing just cuz
 it's like why you trying to impress me I just feeling like that you know it wasn't and it was you know now you know why I'm says we shouldn't read too many books right it's what that means that's why not reading a lot of books you know because I was like for us we see that
 great acciari
like there's so much within this tradition the tradition of a Dante there is a mountain of literature to read out there and that are you know explaining the different nuances of it and debating the the nuances of it
 we feel fortunate that we've had excellent predecessors who taken it all and boil it down for us to the essential information that we need and it that that that essential information will nurse you like crazy and it'll give you the ability to do what the books are meant to help you do is practice it right to actually develop that peaceful mind to actually become the front of everyone to actually feel the presence of God in your heart and see God providing everything that's what we need to do and reading a billion bucks isn't going to help that reading one book could help us do that you know so we all have different services in different aptitudes and different Tendencies but guard against
 just reading like crazy would read it
purpose don't lose the purpose don't you to keep the main thing the main thing of the Man-Thing there's a lot of great spiritual books out there the bottom of time is the main thing you said it differently and keep the main thing the main thing you had a new one for the medicine do major and minor thing there you go it don't major and minor things exactly did you use that one and so so that's important and then
 you know there's a word here since the word for the third one a rump on a Rumba on proper translate that are kind of like what's the word that you use the kind of cheese is it out
 a saying
 oh by the way we skipped an important part of the last one not be coming not taking shelter of any cause or faction
write a book on now but he said he must never attempt to increase material Oculus senses unnecessarily and
 I think was vicious. Chakravarthi Taco he mentions like this means taking a big projects and in the comments writing prompt says you know special for the seniority this is like creating huge temples and things like that you know becoming the resident Guru so you know what your seniority may be done those kind of things previous in your life and now you're minimizing everything it's all getting this all going internal we need people that are wandering around that if mine's really clear free from the anxieties free from the pressures free from the distractions that I'm running a big project is going to create in the mind
 okay that's fine
 a peaceful equipoise person who's back
advance in spiritual consciousness does not need to accept the symbols of a city a city such as that redundant or coming down below there's a walk the sick ass in the water pot for the first time that you ever saw her own faults found me first time ever saw us in the icy was in the Lower East Side I turned around the corner just standing there holding a giant staff to me I was like this is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life and why is it I was 18 internet why is it a big orange stick around while I dress like that and why is he have that that haircut why we remember a peaceful equipoise although I did say that the first time I ever met devotees of Lord Krishna was in the Danbury Connecticut YMCA in eighth grade books
and I went up to I didn't know what they were they're all wearing sarees
 I said what are you guys and they said to me all I remember is they said they were vegetarians and back then
 it must have been like 1980 or 79 I was like what is a vegetarian and why does it what does it have to do with wearing that outfit that you have but she was just like she's really just you know we don't eat me I was like I couldn't even understand what that means you don't eat meat that's how different culture was back then I was like what do you eat and I guess you was trying to humor me she said we like lots of wonderful things like cookies and pie and ice cream I was like an eighth grade I was like this is insane if you are you are insane there like I usually do
don't know about that she didn't know maybe she said hurry Christian I pray for this kid I think that's the only reason why you're here right now right now you know what isn't it crazy that I meant
 already continuing you didn't finish this one there so they can accept the symbols of the staff in the coming down with a begging Bowl
 they may sometimes except those symbols and sometimes reject them external is not essential that verse it'll be Cliffhanger for today cuz that's the opening of the door
 to where we go tomorrow we're here about one such sanyasi one person who had this Consciousness had this incredible Detachment have the same super simple life and had this deep deep realizations but didn't have the symbols of the seniority like the staff in the bag and Bowl lying on the ground like a python
tomorrow.
