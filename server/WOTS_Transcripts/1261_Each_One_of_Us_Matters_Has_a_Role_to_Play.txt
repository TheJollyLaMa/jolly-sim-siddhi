 unbelievable. You know the story about Hanuman and go downhill good story I can I'm not sure if now is the time for it you sound like you want to tell it that's the impression I think it's what you want to do

 okay I did I did an interview
crg Recovery Group by the other day
 the other day yeah some of your addictions you won't tell us which wild gets dark it gets Munich the dark places I've never been addicted to anything we want recovery but I want a person who's already recovered
 alright nugget
 I got a nugget for you and we we talked about him doing a Jane Goodall nugget yesterday but we got sidetracked and now we'll go back to Jane Goodall today
 spiritual lady she sees the being and beings
 I like to go to material list is they don't see the bee
and beings Rockin off I don't see the being and beings I got it
 what is Jane Goodall have to tell us today each one of us matters has a role to play and makes a difference each one of us must take responsibility for our own lives and above all show respect and love for for living things around us especially each other and the gorillas gorillas
 especially each other
 let's see if we got the same algorithm struggle
 I don't think we do sometimes you see the same stuff but I just saw some algorithm were it had like some lady had her little baby by a window in the Gorillaz on the other side of the way
and then the gorilla was that, let me go get my baby in the gorilla ran and got nits baby and brought it up and brought it right up to the window and showing it to the lady and
 kissing a little gorilla have you seen that my what are you talkin about I just told you what I'm talkin about I saw a little video clip in my algorithms Oh I thought you meant our internal algorithm don't think we're talking about the thinking about the same Instagram I don't think I saw that
 I just had to just the emotions since it's similar feelings in the connection of course that was a big thing for Jane Goodall but perhaps we should focus on this nugget for today.
but why don't you go first
 a couple things here in one says it just sounds kind of like a fuel good thing you know that go everybody has a role to play and you know but there's truth in that and it's really important truth but she brought it to showing respect and love for living things around us especially each other and that again it kind of gets to the essence of of spiritual
 vision or spiritual realization right again that I am not turned off even like necessarily turned on turned on or turned off to you because of your externals your body gender
 erase your species even I'm feeling a connection to you in one sense of spiritual Oneness although we're individuals eternally
I feel my spiritual Oneness that is really important and the role that we play some of us are going to be playing quote on quote big rolls
 and some of us are going to be playing quote on quote little rolls
 those are also external is superficial considerations but the important thing is that we do have an idea of what our role is you know what how do I move to this world in such a way where I'm responsible
 and where my awareness is rising up to that level where I am developing love and respect for every living being in the beginning with the origin of all life and then I don't have to necessarily worry about whether my role is you know I'm not Taylor Swift
the biggest star in the world
 why he's not Taylor Swift and the main thing is is it's actually not so much how much we accomplished but really is how how much of our self we give you know how much do we are you could say like how much do we hold on to her not hold onto you do for in selfishness and how much do we let go and make my soul like even you may have
 you know like you know it's an unusually find a single mother working hard to support her kids in the whole life becomes a life of sacrifice you know and and maybe she doesn't a computer doesn't doesn't become a recognized widely Forge
maybe her the realm of her sacrifice and her contemplation and her service is going to be in the small the small Arena
 but if it's done selflessly and if it's done with with that respect and love that is just as purifying and just as pleasing in bhakti to Krishnan in into all the charges in our line all the great teachers you know that selfless sacrifice is just as we speak
 famous story about this would be what is it what am I thinking if these algorithms are connected at story illustrates that I don't know what you're thinking of who are you and who I had another to know each other but we are really on board with it and it didn't play out so do we even know each other in the little squirrel
a little squirrel would you like to tell that story we're going to
 are good story to tell when they were building a bridge
 they're building a bridge to Lanka all the monkeys and bears who could carry very quite big boulders started throwing these big stones in the earth squirrel and little squirrel was pretty little pebbles no no bigger than an egg corn and you you wanted to help me do anything through it in the in the sea that assist to build a bridge to go rescue lady Caesar
 and the monkeys in the bear started saying hey come on he couldn't be here going to be here though your lifetimes those tiny little Pebbles are you doing what are you doing here and Lord Ram should wait a second don't you understand he's doing the best he can you do something like because he's giving his all he's contributing just as much as you are
and you're giving your all he's giving his all it means you're both giving equally have a little and then they say after that he rubbed them on the back you've heard that before
 no that's where you got the stripes on the back the three stripes that like in India at the little squirrels all had have these three white stripes down their back
 I have a little something from she'll probably this is a letter to a disciple
 1972 it is not the result of the work that we want now that's so much was he like he took the last 12 years of his life he was just circling the globe he was opening temples and opening you know starting farms and Community translating books in it in China
Stoners night of movement about the All Around the Globe and it engages and start establishing temples in India again come back to India and then it said he was trying to engage thousands of people in a mission but but still he's he's taking his time to write a letter to one of his disciples or it says it's not the result of the work that we want
 if only we sincerely preach to one person a day that is sufficient never mind big big programs
 so my request to you is that you do not be bothered by these things Krishna does not like to see his sincere devotees suffer or become frustrated depressed he will not stand by idly in such a case Krista has some plan for you
 listen to this right this right here Krishna has some plan for you always thinking that way and very soon he will prove
everything to your heart's desire
 and I kind of like it
 by the way I thought we were going to go to this algorithm from the first Canto second chapter cuz it was talking about everyone has a role to play and the role must involve love so so when we talk about
 what's the best thermos for Lucy top home some salad
 I wish one is looking forward to the one that says without love the highest the highest Dharma is
 B ocean that's what she done for the pleasure of
 but I'll go with him you talk to me direct it towards sent never directed to a sensor location one of those one of those but not that one
call occupational Gage Miss are certainly meant for ultimate Liberation there's never a game
 not that one either station on TV is a person performs according to his own position only so much useless labor yes that one door must be news to top Pumas UNAM this structure and I could talk to you right now not a diet, TV cable just being responsible it's not just showing up and doing your duty we all have a duty in this world but it's doing your duty where they're actually is affection and love for the people in your life
 and in this case in the Bog time says for God that's when he first said are we in the same algorithm achoo I thought okay he's going to say this purse I know it we think they'll like being is Diva to this world my squirrel
 was it was a squirrel and 17 out of squirrel right
I wasn't really if I didn't think mine was a squirrel I thought mine was it all that was the message board Jane Goodall was for chimps not gorillas bother you but you're a little bit of resentment getting correct on that you live to be okay to be corrected I live to be corrected you know there's a way we can connect and listen to Close Your Eyes Forever Grammy okay I sent it over and thinking for real it has to do with everyone having a role to play
 they come to you no more time just drop it to me
I don't have it
 I think we're not in hell I will have about this I will give you him send it with a hint of verbalize the hint it has to do with the bug of agita in the role to play Bhagavad Gita
 I don't know the myth the legend
 11th chapter look at me or America's Got It Mary Muir
 we're not connecting either but that's good that's good that is important know this
Krishna tells Arjuna there for joining the fight prepared to fight and win Glory conquer your enemies enjoying the enjoy and enjoy the flourishing Kingdom he says they're already put to death by my Arrangement and you
 oh savyasachi can be but an instrument in the fight no prop hunt in the commentary to this process of your socks and you know what sub you such a person ambidextrous I think that's what means ambidextrous you can fight with both hands have a right to see says they were first one who can shoot arrows right expertly in the field
 the sergeant is address as an expert Warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies just become an instrument this word in the mid timatim this word is also very significant the whole world is moving according to the supply on the plan of the Supreme personality of got it.
do not have sufficient knowledge to think that nature is moving without a plan it all manifestations are but accidental formations
 there are many so-called scientist to suggest that perhaps it was like this or maybe like that but there's no question of perhaps and maybe there's there's a specific plan being carried out in the material world
 what is this what is this plan is Cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditions soles to go back home that's a guy that's a promise and like the world moves for the for the liberation of all the living beings
 and we all have a role to play in that you know we all have a role in a minute maybe a very apparently tiny roll or maybe like a various large role sometimes I see some of the Renaissance seen this man touched you know how many lies has he changed its all so we're also seeing a very tiny way to
sometimes you're a man or a woman who has just like a very soft heart a loving heart a spiritually connected but they don't appear to have much influence you have to have a child or they have someone has massive things you never know yet you know I remember I think it was some
 it was a long time ago I think I might have been a I I heard an interview with some musicians May banjo strong but I really don't remember so long ago
 and they're asking do you think songs can change the world
 people write songs in them
 and whoever was answered well if they may not change the world but you know they changed people they touch people and people can change the world you know and I think yes so it's so it's so true you know Arjuna was meant to be this big hero and he was asked to do the service in this battle because that's what he was expert at that's what you know he had a natural
and I was his role but any role even if it's the little squirrel whatever it is let's find our contribution in bhakti
 and let's connect wholeheartedly and let's give as full heartedly as we can and that will be perfect for us and perfectly pleasing to Krishna and you know it'll be perfect in whoever we can serve with that as well sometimes it's just being a mother and father of one person sometimes it's being just a good friend to someone you don't trying to do that as as well as you can sometime you know I was speaking with Sarah today and he was talking about some of the some of the frustrating
 some of the frustrating things people go through in spiritual organizations it could be very disappointing sometimes you know it's it's it's so hard on on any level to manage
in the world and nowadays in in a spiritual society would like that expectations are so high you are comely disappointed
 and and you know we just we could we got to the point of conversation once like you do you do what you can to bring good and good energy into the negative energy you know and it and if you can't do it in a big way there's no point in just wallowing and complaining you just try to do it even if it's just a small way you know but you try to contribute in some way that's positive and I will have that role play
 makes you lose faith in people doesn't it it makes me lose faith in the material world that's that's what it is you know it makes me lose faith in this place in this age is a place where we can manipulated in you know I was talking with my wife gets pretty the other day and she's just you know
she's just reading bond with her so she's like she's like Nina taking care of her mother and cooking and just being her caretakers you know that she's really ideal for that
 which is not doing that she's like she's got the study set up like she got this little stand that the book goes on and she's got a notebook over there she does it all in hand you know she doesn't use the computer she writes by hand and she was just were talking about like the creation you know in a second can't do in the third Canto and you know that they are we saw when we were studying that years ago now years ago
 how Lord Vermont
 who's the original being right like he grows in a person's Vishnu and then the first next person that comes from that Divine Creator is Vermont
 and I'll promote you know is confused the first it's dark ec6 down he meditates
 here's the information
needs to hear you know and he begins to go into deep meditation and in that meditation to connect with Tom you know he heard about what time in a condensed form
 and dumb
 with that information he was able to begin the creation and you know a large part of that is populating the Universe on behalf of Vishnu
 and the first of the who were the first people created
 Morris has his son's the four Kumar's right and he has his expectation as soon as you say that you know what do you say we're going to trade in your expectations or appreciation for my can I even appreciate appreciate him and trade it
he's got he's singing okay these poor sons they're going to help me in this Mission and helped me populate the universe and they just they all take one look at the material energy right they're feeling about they're really deeply spiritual and really in touch and they realize this whole thing is is like a powerful illusory realm that were in I don't think it's wise for us to grow up and get into sex and get into family life and get into you know this kind of industrial on a hard life are you kidding it's horrible they say we're going to stay a little five year olds
 and that's it in Vermont like but I'm ordering you as your father to assist me in this holy work now Step Up
 and they're like no and then what happens if he becomes frustrated disappointed he becomes angry you know and then from
from third eye is between his eyes if you get Lord Shiva
 end
 you know what happens with Lord Shiva is also problematic and then
 you know that he experienced his frustration is pointment beer anger
 even humiliation you know and he's the bean
 that has the who is the most expert at manipulating the things of this world you know he's the one that actually has the power to do it we what can we manipulated so tiny and he's got so much ability to make adjustments in this world and still he's going through all of those negative emotions and negative disappointing frustrating experience is so yes this world if you do I lose my I don't lose my faith in people I lose
my face in that this world is a suitable place
 to provide not to experience
 happiness but you provide as happens that happiness comes on a spiritual level whether it's in this illusory realm or in the realm of reality
 there was a good one
 all right that's good

I stayed with his answers but then they but they think after some time they got him
 I got him properly indoctrinated and I think they speak to that here
 and they said they going to whack him with a stick if he doesn't listen
 I was never whacked with a stick in school but I did have my friend got jacked up by the principal and thrown against the wall for the principal School principal is the leader of the school know I said your father was was a teacher in the school as any of my father yeah they had to be weird just got to be tough Elementary School my father was a teacher my high school
yeah it was it awkward
 it was a little awkward it was yeah after some time the teachers Sunday and America thought that provide was sufficiently educated in the Diplomatic Affairs of pacifying public leaders appeasing them by giving the lucrative posts dividing and ruling over them and punish punishing them in cases of Disobedience then one day after his mother had personally wash the boy and dressed him nicely was sufficient ornaments they presented in before his father Ben re-educated
 when hiranyakashipu so that his child had fallen at his feet and was now offering a base and sees as an affectionate father he immediately began
showering blessings upon the child and embraced him with both arms a father naturally feels happy to embrace his son and her any cuz you pookie I'm very happy in this way
 Denard is talking to you to steer my my dear you to steer around you cash a post-dated prologue on his lap and began smelling his head that's something people do in their kids sniff of their heads wash your hair with baby shampoo with affectionate ears gliding down from his eyes and moistening the child's smiling face he spoke to his son as follows okay now remember we're going to sit there for questions as to provide in this chapter
 first one was from her in a cockapoo which was basically what was your favorite thing you learned at school today yeah second one was from the his teacher saying where did you learn all this crazy stuff that you can talk
here comes the third question from Iranian High School more or less the same question is the first one but in each one of these questions
 Blood start speaking mind-blowing stuff what are you laughing at
 I have a great squirrel here I forgot to tell you what I did today me and Mara we want to know hard time. Seuss's Naruto Sakura secret cave cooked never heard about this place could prank or even above us there it's in those people's house you can just got to go into their house and you got to say can we go to the secret cave and their hits hits hits Please and they bring us to this like little caged room and you open this creaky door and then climb down these very narrow stairs into a little room in the basement floor it says a big deal
I just locked it up unless I was thinking the same. They locked us down there they could have been a little altar and it's under there has a must have built the house right on top of his high school is that what you doing down there
 she had a little talk a little piece okay okay all right 20 take a pass bro that's already cuz you put said I'm going to take you to that the cave my dear message I got a message from your goswami friend there
 from Mario swimming yeah he said oh please come and run that comes and we will go to all the B let's dance together
 still he just sent email
at the same time
 he just sent you a message
 all right my dear Pearl on my dear son a long-lived one
 for so much time you have heard many things from your teachers now please repeat to me whatever you think is the best of that knowledge and what is he thinking like wasn't don't do that my math math was really good I think even he was looking more for that like those four things like first you try to bribe me into this and then if not then they get the stick and I think he wanted to hear that,
 I wasn't thinking that but okay I said 11 in this the longest commentary and she'll probably books I think
 Freemason
prolonged Mirage price to do the Sansbury brother tomorrow night. I'm going to bed and I want to read one line at a time or smaller number
 archana mundhinam decision, nobody like you said but I was just doing it for memory oh okay well that's that's a maybe if you read it it would be yes for the thing you learned hearing and Shay
shravan a to them about the transit at the holy name in form and qualities and paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Vishnu remembering them serving the Lotus feet of the Lord offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia offer that that's arch in them the Lord mundhinam becoming his servant doxium considering the Lord ones best friend suck your thumb and surrendering everything onto him and other words serving him with the body-mind of words, Nevada them
 these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service one who has dedicated his life to the service of Sri Krishna through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person or he has a choir
complete knowledge of thought about that and I don't think he liked it and I liked it at all that is not what you wanted to hear but these are the nine that these are commonly known as the nine processes of body processes of
 appear devotional service and what exactly does that mean we can get into it but you know like
 their worldly acts we have to do in this world right like you're a father in a $0.01 that's like a worldly responsibility that you have sure now some people are just fathers and has absolutely nothing to do with bakhtiar devotional service they acted the action of being a father isn't inherently
 related to Bucky but you can be a few can take the role of a father and fill that role with meditation on Krishna
and then that role takes on the nature of bhakti pray like if you're seeing your children as children of God and your response really care for them and on behalf of God now you've taken to Worley activity and you've instilled it with the nature of body through you were members of Krishna as you do it
 but there are certain activities that you you don't have to invest them with foxy they are by Nature invested with body right and so that's that is Dee's nine different processes and so when we say someone practices bhakti yoga you know like sometimes I think in the western like yoga world
 the ideas of what these things really mean kind of get really water down so that I'm into the eyebot to yoga but bhakti Vinyasa
but really the box of Yogi
 they have established in and they said in intention to have established in their mind their goal and that goal is to Chief Krishna Prema pure love for God
 to the practice is about it and it means that they do these practices some of these practices at least one of these practices
 as part of their that you know as their practice you know so like particular shrub and I'm hearing and it cured him chanting you know these are things at the buck to Yogi does that strong yoga may not to like yeah he may not to a Karma Yogi may not two but the box of yogis do these things right they hear the pastimes of Christian the bog with time they chant the names of Krishna on their japa mala you know a secluded meditation or
kirtan you know like it in a communal meditation
 they smart them they meditate on the pastimes of Krishna and remember them how to say what I did because it's such a long power cord but I just took a little made it to a clip little nuggets yeah yeah yeah
 so let's start with Troublesome cities are some of the things are probably Mansions struggling means Hearing in Baton
 is considered one of the most important processes of hearing Schumann box him is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name and therefore the chanting and hearing a true and Bob and Tom
 are Transit Dental full of Melos so this is standard if we want to practice bhakti we should know that this is my daily practice like you know someone tried to Centerstone
show me to do an option of the do in front of your mother doing put your heart into like those are standard facets of that practice hearing Bob Atomic particular hearing from the sacred text Abby come sit in central part of it now for kirtan improper share some of this
 the hearing of the holy name has been described above now let us try to understand the chanting of the Holy Name which is the second item in the consecutive order it is recommended that such chanting be performed loudly in the time nor the money says that without without shame he began traveling all over the world Jenny the Holy Name Of The Lord simerly SRI chaitanya mahaprabhu has advised to not a piece and he chained to a piece of each new not a Mane na Mana Dana keertana sidari
 a devotee, can very peacefully Chan
Holy Name Of The Lord by behaving more company than the grass be more tolerant like a tree
 in offering respect to everyone without expecting honor from anyone else
 such qualifications make it easier to chant the Holy Name Of The Lord the process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone
 even if one is physically unfit
 classified lower than others
 devoid of material qualifications check
 or not at all elevated in terms of Pi Psych tivities the chanting the holy name is beneficial
 an aristocratic birth in advance that nope and advanced education nope beautiful bodily features nope well nope and similar is
surprise activities are all unnecessary or dance fitness spiritual life for one can very easily Advanced simply by changing the Holy Name
 it is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age Kali Yuga people are generally short-lived check extremely bad here have to check checks and inclined to accept methods
 of devotion service that are not bona fide very interesting right there's just so many you know Miss representations of of it out there there's a lot out there
 moreover they are always disturbed by material conditions and they are mostly unfortunate
 under the circumstances the performance of other processes such as yoga doing these elaborate rituals Donna
giving a charity Papa performing austerities Crea a different yogic processes for purification sacrifices charity and someone are not at all possible, saying you guys cannot be Yogi's you guys you know being being the ritual brahmins won't help you just take these names I just need to accept these names and meditate in the hear this holding you so that was troubling him and then character question on the message board what if a person's death pachuta asks questions death they can't do that one you can feel that vibration though you don't even death people can
 that's happening by Brayden you
 or they could do that they could do with the other one they can do the it is said suck him but you know then what we can say so you can just changing your mind also chance Island
what if they never heard the Holy Name
 X-Men figure it out after the hell I don't know what it's like to hear that that if you never liked if you never heard any sounds how do you understand what sounds sound like I think you would have to feel the vibration with your body
 you know and then you meditate on this vibration suppose I did tell them to worship a deity that can't hear
 what if they can't see all the Sign Language sign language what if they couldn't see
 Helen Keller did it she didn't you just got a chance at them they're chanting at them I would take your hand if this happen to run out to take your hand and what they have known that you just pour some water on them
okay alright let's pull it back in okay alright the next one
 it's called Smart in America has remembering remembering that you know we say remembering but
 we might think more if it means like meditating right like bringing your mind to something to an object of focus David Harbour Road according to different relationships with the Supreme person of the godhead
 there there are varieties of Nam on a tandem Channing of the holy name and US according to different relationships he's Mellows and it Mellows there are five kinds of remembering now he is now he's speaking about smart them as like these really yogic meditational practices so he says this
 there are as follows a conducting Research into the war
Tickler form of the Lord Lee concentrate in the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mines activities of thinking feeling and willing from all other subjects that's like a very strong yogic kind of idea
 see concentrating on a particular form of the Lord this is called meditation
 we hear descriptions of that kind of thing like in the third can't over business form is describing your bringing your mind to the feet and then The Shins in the new you know you're moving different all the different features
 D concentrating one's mind continuously on the form of the Lord this is called Drew Vaughn a pretty or perfect meditation like your mind stays there for a very long time and he Awakening A likening for concentration upon a particular form this is called somebody or trance
 it sounds like a different levels of depth of focus
but then this is what probably now probably shows this in this is kind of more like one box of Yogi say Samara in and it seems like to me this is more Watauga mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance therefore sumati transfer can be possible in five different ways in terms of one's relationship in which one
 probably says that mental concentration bring him in mind
 the Christmas Past Times as I read about in these books
 in particular circumstances and what I understand that to mean is one way that is coming down as Christian does different pastimes as different parts different times of the day
 in the morning he wakes up and he does this and then he goes and does that and then you know in at the different times of the day we know what he's doing so there are you Okies that's it and during those different parts of the day then meditate I'm a Christian does it though
so perhaps that's what properties alluding to
 maybe it was just a looting to you remember particular Pastime and Krishna stealing the close of the gold be stealing butter you know leaving brindavan or playing with the Cowboys
 that's what I always look at it tomorrow night in particular circumstances that's the phrase that I'm on King and I
 so I think that also might mean is that also could be a reference to different Russ's right yeah how how Christian is with his Cowherd friends how he is with the coward girls how he is with his parents in a sunnyway remembering Christmas Past Times smart is a very beautiful Rich it's it's a practice that requires greater Purity otherwise have difficulty focusing the mind but it's very beautiful rich
and it's one that's as we begin to advance her mind starts to go there naturally
 I will run out of time we're out of baby we stopping to pick a part of Saving him when we on tomorrow
 yeah tomorrow we're off tomorrow the day after tomorrow afternoon after 10 at our earlier time but hanger
 it's the nine process of bhakti cliffhanger hey Mara what do you got for us today how come we remember The Bob & Tom the course of the day
 I got some stuff to do
 move through the world in a responsible way showing love and respect for all the whole nugget itself giving your all whether you're a little squirrel or Hanuman
have at this time he'll have some squirrels are actually not a distract distracted. Squirrel sorry I'm just going to take my squirrel now so I had to go to the bathroom we put down the mountain. I'll let you know
 best place to me that's right.
 Forgive me rug and I forgive me Mara I have done wrong on everybody on the I want everybody unzoom to repeat after me
X rocking off the music by their contributions to find their contribution and doctor and give wholeheartedly
 okay that's being instrument and Christmas fight
 who's faith in the material world providing us happiness
 it's not going to do it we don't need a high birth or Good Karma to advance and spiritual life just chance
