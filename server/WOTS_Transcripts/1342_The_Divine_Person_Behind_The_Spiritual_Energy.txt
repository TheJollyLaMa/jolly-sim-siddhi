a little a little a little more bodies when I sign on a bus and went to the beautiful Springs and waterfalls I just posted some pictures where we swam cooled off and then we went to the Ancients Village walled city of Volterra and spent the day they're on a Museum tour eating we found a plant-based restaurant as soon as we got there so about 20 of us went right there this sleepy little village we just that place and he's the owner would like all my god really give us that vegan mozzarella sir
 and it was really cool you know what it was they built this Cafe with it what was it called the name of the cafe
 we can't remember but if you're involved
that was
 anyway it would they had they had a glass floor and underneath the floor they showed how that you know when you when you renovate the building they found a whole archaeological dig underneath them so there was like a well dating back before Jesus we saw another Museum same kind of restaurant in Tuscany so that it was just like you go see how we found this thing and then they put a hold on there a renovation for 2 years as the Arctic or Gala just came in he's like we knew it was all they found all these Roman coins while you're digging it was like a dream come true for me imagine that I was saying this all the time when we going to the Museum of this beat all the end of the day and into the ground pulling out all different types of stuff you just don't know anything about it but other than that it's like totally everything
it's what they call the point where they call the coin.
 See what I mean what do they call I don't know what I called to ask me a question if you do not know the answer to no but I admit that I don't know it you're saying that you do you see how that was at we just called the Roman coins is heading west people and holding a retreat for the LA Rafi otra at Veda yoga in Los Angeles to La rathyatra Lord jagannath is a particular deity of Krishna this Festival originated in Hungary in odisha in the East India thousand
I don't even know the beginning of time is one of these ancient temples and then probably brought that Festival to the west and we just went to the New York rathyatra and for those who were there for the first time their minds were blown loan and then if you've never been there my favorite is New York and l.a. actually it does you to pay me to your favorites in America and actually know what you're like these ones in Florida they do on the beach or wanting to be a sort of like spring break people don't know what's all the kids from Alachua pull in the car everybody's like it s my teenage son was there a sort of like girls in bikinis guys in the election in a swim shorts Lord jagannath I was like this like a teenager devoting his dream come true for card through the sand and jumping in the water when it gets too hot anyway I always going to be great it's right along it goes from Dogtown what we know is Dogtown

 never going to bring a lot of real life three dimensional human not that you are not that but you're not that right now for us but let's get your hot ass down here from Norway just met your harness in person but he's been showing up live on Zoom but he's got a whole interesting little backstory to get to say Yohannes yes last year after the retreat when me and McKelly and Mara and my little boy were eating dinner at a restaurant in San cassiano right up the road and walked in this Backpacker welcome it was our what was your store did you come I can't remember it refresh my memory what happened well I was interested in bhakti from a distance so I thought I'd come here to see the museum Target me a tour and then by chance my Airbnb was 1 minute away from where he ended up getting dinner that night so I just ambushed you
when I walked in you didn't know we were there though I just felt our exit window and that's one of those moments in life we like I could go for it or I could just not to anyone. I went for it luckily I know I'm here that's so cool did I invite you to sit with us and eat I know sorry I was like we're having dinner so please leave us I know you're a very sweet I was great to get up here it's good and yeah but what happened after you went back how did you get more into it well I took that as a sign to sort of start listening more regularly get I was like 300 episodes behind at that point I think 300 episodes behind not bad considering we have 1,300 episodes well I didn't stop in the beginning but I was that far ahead of the beginning
 twin early
2021 I think they're just running 300 behind and then I found this speed up function in my podcast app without speeding up you I was yours way to speed him up to slow you down okay so what's your deal now you're going to say this group I am who's in college and people organized this whole thing is a whole Machinery running for you and you can just show up it's amazing the great Souls that are behind that another facet of our community of people who create all these things organized all these things and do all these things worst injury she roupa Linda Linda Linda is helping a bunch of Bahari then of course
 that those who are creating the holy web platform which was
labor of love to help support this community it's really sort of grow when we have accountability of a community morning already dropped will talk you spoke yesterday morning in the morning good morning son. Good morning sound good at what you do with that it's already exists on the platform that's the kind of thing that you got when you is nothing that we're going to be pumping out loud and new okay so there's our push for come join our community it's a monthly contribution we subsist on your mercy so yes was going to say to that, right
everything cost a fortune to Norway maybe they can you hear your beautiful man the conquest what should I prepare for the Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you to shoot most human being until mother starts walk to the goddess of learning and destroy the velocity of the author now that's definitely a show about race Unity hamburger that's all that is troublesome to the heart would become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transmittal songs we establish as in a revocable fact
Jonathan genis Lucaya he said they're loaded feat reading for the Shema Bob and Tom can't do 7 chapter 10th x 48 I got it right here so we could just give it up on if you want okay let me whether a Jeffrey Epstein have a shell
 are you ready so we're we're back in the bottom of time where is the end of a long conversation is it and it's a n
maybe I should have done that maybe I should have kept you alive over here and I'm think I'm listening to you okay for the injectors well if we lured to string a Dave has been an end and a lot has been going back and forth who's who it was discussing that is disgusted with you this year has to me so now they're just wrapping up that conversation and we've heard so much of the glories of plaud this this section is the way of the author of all the great Vedic literature be on the show in the Bible time now I'm going to I'm going to make everything very clear if you were missed it confused about read all these books and couldn't quite understand where does it all go I'm telling you right now goes to Divine love to go to the body and in order to show you how special it is I want to narrate the story about SRI Prasad great great little soul right
 now that that's done
you might be thinking o
 play provide really is amazing I wish I were more like that I don't know if I can ever be like that I don't know if if Krishna will ever see me like that I don't know if I can ever come to the level it could be I could bring it down a little bit right sure sometimes a great yeah I'm so bad that happens with people since it's so understanding the mind of of unisteer now nod is going to speak to him and say all that you pawned of us you're very special here you're right up there with pride in some ways
 they're even more special because you know this new appeared to Claude for a moment they have some discussion and then he was gone not that he wasn't always in my heart so that's there too but Krishna stayed with the pontiff has all that he would come and visit them
stay with her good friend is it not only the friend he related with them intimately and many many different ways even be called me like a servant of them so this is a famous verse actually did the verses that were going to be reading coming up and it's just showing something about the nature of God do the Bobby Thompson explained that we can understand God and in three ways there's the impersonal all-pervasive energy of God is everywhere but if you but that's that's kind of like God not showing everything right like holding back his whole essence of there's some
 all this coming from one dance or your closet and I used to go to my father's closet okay
I just wonder about the next birth
 the essence of a person like that son of it to get essence of what turned out to be the close of the being by the scent of the being other property being so that the impersonal feature that you don't see God face to face you see God in his Essence innocent the non personal energy all-pervasive energy of God but it says but you can know God more intimately when you understand that he experienced in the form of Lord Vishnu and he enters the soul of every living being any others that you can every atom the energize is everything ties it all together that's part of his brother and his partner, but still in it but that's still not the full picture that says he hasn't revealed in the hole is also
but he Reveals His whole self is Buncombe honest as soon as Krishna himself is so is a boy in a beautiful boy you can love him and any variety of ways that that that that bag of bond forms of the very personal form is most special a lot of times people have it I kind of like you can call an issue a hangout but you know fear fear I did that I don't want to be dependent on any person if I'm depending on the energy that's spelled that way I can live with that but another person I don't know why because we have so many mixed up experiences with people with people with authorities as we are and sometimes with the church leaders which school teachers which older brothers are nutty uncle's or something like that so we have some Authority issues when I finally get to a place of self-governance that I was like no I don't trust higher authority have you been home to retina
 tell me earlier I've been hurting like us to buy
I'm sorry but so any case now we're going to hear that when you get to know Krishna he's not all at all that you fear it's none of that you have to worry about that Christian is all love is a matter of everything in all those relationships were you were searching for that love and got disappointed you going to find it right here cuz he he responds to you in such a loving woman and you were going to see how hard is going to think about you should think about Krista in your own life think about all the ways that he's shown his love to you in a little while I drive was you your family is very very special that's what you say Krishna is that unconditional love that you want sometimes you project that another person we expect people to love us like we want Christian to Louis we have that desire for unconditional love it's it's natural natural but that's most reposed in a higher source sometimes we find people who can actually really be good for us they're really good people in our in our life
But ultimately the material world will let everybody down because we're all fallible we don't know what each other are thinking if we also get sick and die sometimes people get sick and die in if you like that one am I supposed to do my partner died and they died that's a very common thing there's a name for that someone looked it up on the message board please with your partner dies then you can share like a little later and he's like I've got nothing sometimes we've been together for many many decades ya ever see me people that been together for decades and take a look like each other that's weird is pining for that too is probably there for that when we get into the gym like their dogs are there pets 2
 okay have you ever seen this verse from the human body with him but you just hear all of you are fond of us
call Janice families with youth in case you are extremely fortunate for the Supreme personality of godhead Krishna lives in your Palace just like a human being like an orange like anyone else would imagine if Krishna like lived in your guest room.
 And we make crystal you're leaving your sandals around again
 what a Christian is like clean and orderly if he's a little like you know I have a feeling there would be running around doing a lot if that were the case you can't get mad at him but sometimes those are very intimate with him do any Ashley because there's a little flavor in the knee relishes that is little flavor in downstairs I want to take a tour and get a little tour of the downstairs paintings is there some of these paintings I just want to burst into tears God
 is Krishna related
the pond has young lady with your opening relating with Conte and it's just like it makes you want to cry your eyes out let's do that painting to her sleeping crying a little bit she lives in your Palace just like a human being great saintly persons know this very well and therefore it constantly visit this house great Souls like nor do these these higher beings they want to come and visit, but it's not like I'm just visiting some ordinary politician right like a fancy house like if there's something very special and spiritual like you like this Monday Music Museum so you know you're like a big deal and you're like
okay now the next verse this is an important one is Krishna himself or we talked about that a bomb trace of spiritual energy that some people think that's beyond any person that comes from me before I just got of the Jungle yeah but actually that's comes from Krishna the impersonal up Ramon is Krishna himself because Krista is the source in this right there at the Bremen do heat for Tisha and the basis on the source of that it is comes for me he is the origin of the transit of the Bliss sought by great with Steely persons cuz there's some concepts of you I'll go buy you just want the Bliss you want the light you want the right not a person is also not a person is it
cereal pulled in different directions and where we get how we get involved we can pull by your senses by our tongue by our belly our genitals are pulling us around but we want to be free from the poles we just want some peace Christmas a source of that we think people are the problem is not exactly people's is how we understand those people how we relate to people over the commentary
 well alright be a sober mind is Krista himself because Krishna is the source the impersonal Ramon he is the origin of the transit at the Bliss sought by great saintly persons yet he the Supreme person is your most dear friend and constant well-wisher and is intimately related to you as the son of your maternal uncle
cousins indeed he is always like your body and soul he is worship Ebola yet he acts as your servant and sometimes as your spiritual Master how did he is a servant of the pound of this
 do you draw The Chariot so that's the one that's in the messenger they become a messenger like how he tried to eat try to establish peace so they wouldn't get into a stretcher War he practically begged you to show us just one piece it'll be good so we became a messenger boy became the envoy for the pontiff has traveled long distances to go get out of their message and then he became the spiritual master and then he became the guru
who started their Guru but they always looked at him well in the back of a kid I used to go to a bar to know that's a lot of times I've been treating you like a friend yeah okay so it's so he's saying not only do you have an intimate connection with him you have an intimate family connection with them not not only do you have an internet connection but he has as his servant but he serves you as if he were your servant he loves you so much he wants to taste what if what it tastes like to serve those he loves and he loves you so much she becomes your messenger email Dr your chariot Hilton Orrington but I think about how special that is it becomes good attentive attentive friend and he demonstrates that in that those stores in the Mahabharat how is a very attentive friend of drippity attentive attentive friend of you this year and attentive friend of beamer
he carries Joe Patti's shoes on her on his head so it must be the commentary there is always a difference of opinion about the absolute truth right this is this difference of opinion exist in truth in all spiritual traditions and here is it at here they are one class of transcendentalist concludes that the absolute truth is impersonal when you get to the end there's no person behind it there's just this Divine energy my light and another class concludes the absolute truth is a person give me a hug
 in Bhagavad Gita the absolute truth is accepted as the Supreme person indeed the Supreme person himself Lord Krishna instruction the bug of agita Rama know he put this top, top hat together
my partial manifestation and there is no true Superior to me that's that's the same some of my name Krishna the Supreme personality of God had acted as the Supreme friend and relative of the pain of us and sometimes he even acted as their servant by carrying a letter from the part of us to Trina rostra Andrea because Christina was the well-wisher the part of us he also acted as a guru by becoming the spiritual master of Arjuna or June accepted Krishna spiritual master
 and Krishna sometimes chastised him the Lord said while speaking learning words your morning for that which is not worthy of grief the Lord also said
Bishop Brady Arjuna Howard easom. He's come upon you such was the initial relationship between the pain of us and Krishna the same way a devotee of the Lord is always with Krishna through thick and through thin his way of life is Krishna this is the statement of the authority extra dollar that money that's interesting way to praise his way of life is Krishna the center of the entire life isn't tension goes that way it's hard to close that weighs his actions go that way his words they all go to digging in her heels and saying yeah Krishna has no in personal for me just have an impersonal form but the impersonal is the source comes from the personal in the same way the sunlight comes from the sun Globe right right right now it's not uncommon to see probably sit in the he said there's two different people have 22 different ideas some believe the absolute truth is impersonal
some believe the absolute truth is a person that has the bug of agita says that the absolute truth is a person get when you get to the when you take it to the final and you find a person that now it's not uncommon if you read other books that are less direct same author Beyonce bright same Sage compiling this this Timeless wisdom
 if you read certain books it'll feel more like no the impersonal comes at the end to see a drive at this one that's because he was explaining it to people that that that appeals to write he's giving spirit has two people with that idea appeals to because there is some type of benefit as opposed to being a complete materialist yes and so that we find it within what we know as Hinduism it's not the sort of black and white there's a Nuance versions of our spiritual life the grossest of the grossest example of existing amateur world's a materialist is I'm the center everything around
to fulfill my ego and my senses to please meet is good everything is going to take me away from that pleasure is bad and so then in the 12th chapter starts talking about little bits of sacrifice to take you out of the center right and I think we get this as adults as we especially if you have children you start to realize okay it's not about me and then I'll just it's all about me and then you get married you realize okay it's not all about me and even if you can override your partner's I know you you better serve me and that's what it said to do better serve me that all the second pop out a couple of kids and you realize okay now it's really not about me and you start like having to maintain its the idea of sacrifice means I am no longer the center I'm giving back to something bigger than myself maybe it's a small as a partnership babies as small as a family may be smart of a village or town or a city and then in the ultimate big way we realize that we are constantly sacrificing and there's a payoff we get something
I can return good good karma we feel better about ourselves we feel more talk to people about about you. The time of death what means relatively materialistic person that you know my family family is very important you know because if sacrifice for something bigger than themselves expanded their field of concern themselves to broader and then within Hinduism there's always interesting metaphysical ways to climb ladders out of even of this world there's ways to get a payoff certain demigods to get some mystical tricks in our bag of tricks or or two of worship some planets to sort of counteract some malevolent planet or malevolent Karma that you have Spectrum which is an aspect of someone's Bad Karma and there's a thing about worshiping God for something that is idea of like worshiping
show me the absolute truth in an impersonal way to free myself from a sensual experience that has a beginning and an end and so then and they're saying but if you want. And basically all of the bay to see if these things are completely otherworldly bargaining for pleasure
 but this one piranha is Imola piranha the Spotless piranha the bog of a time and then when you read the Bhagavad Gita now to be able to make it actually fully blossomed you fully understand all people can appreciate that all different spiritual Traditions but once you read it with the by what time you get off I get where this whole thing is going and this is why it's called the final conclusion or the cream of the crop because there is nothing there except pure Prema love of God
could hear that Applause back there and he was my mic only picks up things up close but yet so so a lot a lot of people that we were discussing earlier just stay with her I know you were exhausted yourself but they feel and maybe because they want to feel this that any manifestation of personality is just some temporary material programming in a mind but it for dumb humans that need a personality so yes it's so so all of that is artificial all of that is temporary all of it is illusion it actually doesn't actually exist because all that exists is spiritual energy and and so if you want we get to real true spirituality there's no personality left
 what's the bug of agita says what Christian saying about we get there what we're reading about what time is that there's a fall
ego that's that's programming in the mines but there's actually a real person a real Eagle real self that's individual has its own free will and has that Free Will eternally has it individuality Charlie that we are not our existences isn't just some illusory unexplainable painful kind of play of that one spiritual energy that comes around and suffers for a very long time and then stopped suffering it's saying that no no no the Destin let's just even it doesn't there's not a soundlogic to that but there's a very sound-like Dodger to the edge of the we are all individuals Sparks we are individual I'm always me you always you make sense when we enter into the virtual reality of this world it's just like we took on an avatar and we began to identify with that Avatar right we had a
we got a body with its senses and then programming within the mind and we begin to play that role behind it is still a person that's us and so yoga becomes the practice by which we uncover the true self on Monday dress ourselves from the costumes we've been wearing easy on Andres TV show it sometimes you take a take on the role of Clan of the characters of the show or a movie then start acting like I Tony Soprano or something something like that you get attracted by some
 thing that they have some Persona I need to take that on you want to be like that crazy person on the show that's why you got to be careful what shows you watch and see some it should be some like parameters and what shows you can make I'm I'm Into You Want to censor
I think there should be like this when he's real creepy movies censored sensor them I just feel like they're giving creepy people creepy ideas so now you're the judge here you decide what we can and can't do with my sensor you people might say this podcast I know I would I would say that the bog latam be the judge and I don't have to step out I can be on the board of directors if they want but
 but it's also property quoted to versus from both of you get to hear one was the one we discussed earlier brumbelow he printed out I come from the Brahma on the basis of that it comes from a very interesting purse right where he says it all things are strong upon me as pearls are strong upon a threat than enjoying my server me dump Rotom Sutra money
Eva to all the pearls that look like they're all together magically floating around someone's neck but actually there's An Invisible Thread holding them all together Krishna is Invisible Thread there must be we can look at that in a there must be a thread Blues holding them all together it's interesting cuz you see we were to talk about this this morning you see this beautiful gigantic 10ft Garuda and Vishnu sculpture you see this massive 16 x 16 ft painting it's like a little wherever there is a Creator a creation there is an intelligent Source behind it who's planning things out and holding it together we can't see that Creator I don't know who painted that I don't know who carved that but somebody did it we can infer that okay so Chris is saying you can buy by seeing order in the universe you can
strong together and I am the one that streams it together and then he says there is no truth Superior to me and this goes that this is this is not just this is a very is hamstrung a very specific idea right that's taught that the idea that okay if I'm in it if I believe that the highest thing is impersonal I might say okay your worship of Krishna that will help you..... OK Google stop playing your little butt cute little sweet little bit of a Barclays things worshiping God but ultimately eaten you express emotion especially if their particular emotional person but when you want to come to real truth it's not bad at all and you'll find that all form is illusion including your sweet Little Krishna
idea you use Krishna to get to that place where is Chris when I get there but no it's a horribly bothered to get to be fine Christian said there's no truth Superior to me that's not like I'm a stepping stone I'm not your stepping stone is that's what I say I'm not your Stepping Stones a very spiritual song I'm not it's not like you worship me and then you let me go and then you find was beyond me which is in person know it's the other way around flip it the impersonal comes from me you can you can you can advance from in personal understanding to Parma understanding ultimately to the personal form of God knows that's that's the that's the progression that goes and if you think about it just think about it just think about it I have been thinking at least this time for love if you just go deep within your own heart you're going to find it you're going to go deeper and try I'm going City come back out
, the kangaroo thing that Direction with you a couple weeks back to remember that me and the naked eye with a few days to let me in the house you can carry a gun in a cave with the kangaroo okay I was going to say there's this video of this guy he's inside his house and he's got big sliding glass doors and a huge kangaroo comes up and puts his claw up against the glass that Clause oh yeah I'm serious looking dead and by stray lien people who don't have Australian yes it would seem that powerful creatures yeah so it's you they're scary he's standing up on his hind legs and he puts his law up against the women
 yeah you look at that I would think
but now the person under Sito he's calling from me he needs help because I say help me and so you eat followed the kangaroo and then he founded the baby the Joey Joey Joey stuck down in some kind of deep crevice and they didn't have like the arms or the grip Lobster close took the little arms from the little Joey and just hold it wasn't easy pulled it out of that crevice and in the kangaroos were so touched by this that group over there and every day that remember basically be great to be accepted into a little
forever grateful now that right there is inside the heart of every living being that the depreciation of love that call for love it's their it's not Arthur that's take take, I totally agree take comfort in the fact that that's not illusion that that's actually real now how it's playing out make may have been warped through your mind but Underneath It All it's real animals that are like they're abandoned by their mother and then like there they just like that left with a tiger two tigers bite to eat in there like instead of a girl I click said it's like a sickness but I think I shared it with you and I know that that's how people become raised by the wolves
 we had a whole episode about Raised by Wolves didn't we I don't think I'll have some but I share this with you before the wolf goes out to bring home bring food home for the babies and if they bring enough home and they bring a human baby home as well then if they're already full by the time it comes to the human baby then did they leave
therefore now if he's given you no end of a baby come from they go to the village and it find it the wolf eats takes a human baby the wolf takes a human baby to feed the young Pope it doesn't kill it or does can I was going to wait to kill it to the moment that the eat it but now the children did the Young are already full and in this is a thing and this is why India is the place where most it's true all these feral children found in India want to tell you why I want to share with you the secret share with me or wisdom told it to you before but it didn't it didn't register so it's okay because I've been looking at the message board how do I have I missed out on this
 okay and so the mothers it's a thing it's a felon that oil and then starts to lick the baby right and went after she's been licking that baby for enough time she starts to Associated relate relate relate to it as if it's
baby okay and that's how human a baby's got raised by the wolves
 why is that so funny Barrel thing you always say if you Google feral children India is the land of feral now you know what children wolves are they the only one that we spend enough time with this number now is the time we move on I'm sorry you revealed all we know on the subject now we could do some research tomorrow about feral feral children raised by various is Gabby monkeys raising humans
