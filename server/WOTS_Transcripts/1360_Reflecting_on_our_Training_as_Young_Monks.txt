 alright that sounds great ready for the Nugget I'm ready are you
the Nugget of the day who's it from
 it is from your friend in mine Peter Hollens do you know that he's a best-selling author and human psychology and behavior researcher
 yeah here's what he has to say today
 or whatever you're being out of this for whatever goal you want to achieve there is discomfort there's discomfort along that path self-disciplined drives you through this discomfort and allows you to achieve and attain it's an essential component of Mastery and nothing great is ever accomplished without it
 welcome discomfort now you got to welcome and right never heard of it there's the pain of discipline or the pain of regret okay I asked the same thing a little bit more concise
but it is true you got to suffer anyway and and the pain of regret that is like compound interest paid if we from the karmic Viewpoint of we say I'm due a certain amount of suffering will then I may as well use that suffering towards a goal and voluntarily accept it right rather than just like let it come in some meaningless or less meaningful way yeah yeah
 got some realizations reading what we're reading about with him right now which is
 nardis instructions to you to steer on the brahmacharya Ostrom on how do you know especially the young man in The Vedic tradition get strained
 you and I didn't get it like at 8 years olds or 10 years old or 12 years old like someone would get it
 like you're going back in that tradition
we got it at about 20 years old 21 years old it's kicked in and when we lived it especially through our twenties but the more as I hear those instructions I just think back on that or not we're hitting some some some like
 you either we're reaching these latter are is in our life now you know what's with you and I are pushing sixty now and her head so he's pushing it is it is it like you can you look back at these times now that they're more in the distant past past and you got it and so you don't think about them necessarily as much and if this is making me think about those times and really at this stage of my life
 you know I think anyone almost anyone could paint a picture of any time in their life and in with a view of victimization or you know whatever Injustice is my TV. I think either of us could do that if we want to
honestly all you got to do is focus on it all you got to do is look at the grains of wood on the desk I could blow this up in my mind and see pictures and it turns out that I could write a book of how we've been mistreated this afternoon and I almost really I almost feel like if I would have had that knowledge in that training back then where the hell in my life being now I feel such gratitude for it and
 more than any you know this idea that hey
 in order to accomplish any to make sense your life grade to develop better character to make this life
successful in meaningful is going to require self-discipline if I think that 2 my youth before that before we enter the roundabouts to yoga maybe Sports we got a little bit of that in I can't really think of a teacher but you know that was helping me understand that in my life clearly I don't want to say nobody was but I don't remember it it was certainly there are no deep Impressions left but when we got to those you know what did you turn to charge twenties in in this world about the yogurt we enter that world about the yoga in a in a full-immersion we're really Shone like we're given such a vision of them
 a practitioners that we're doing it in their own life and have knowledge that we were that was new to us that gave us such drive that we were eager to embrace whatever discomforts were there with the real clear understanding of the Ben
it gave us that he said self-discipline drives you through this discomfort we voluntarily accepted a lot of discomfort but it was it almost became fun and it became very meaningful and we all need that in our life somehow you know
 yeah yeah yeah it's coming anyway it was we voluntarily today anyway and just come for the material material life exist I was just thinking how
 whatever we're going through
 there is it
 what we what better be funny right now
happy man sad and a sad man happy what makes a man happy their attitude 3 words 3 words it will pass it will pass the temporary nature of material have a beautiful this isn't everything is going on Grey to my life is so this it will pass to see a beautiful flower and you like it's going to be going to be dead soon I am just everything of this world passes makes me a little sad and then of course you're going through some intense suffering you stub your toe when you got shot in the leg you're going through some pain it will pass
 you might die but it might die it will pass yeah and so on and so on
to really be successful at what we're talking about is you can't live in that you can't live in that sensation we we understand what you're saying that's going to pass yeah there there's something guy called I see what you were going to your work for accepting austerity or of self-discipline so then you got to choose then you got to choose your disciplines
 what would you say to someone that says you know I'm not 20 years old and in with no responsibilities and able to fully immerse myself in this I never went through your ashram experience your Bromwich our experience I'm 45 years old or whatever and is there a way to kind of bring that element into my life voluntarily accepting discomfort applying self discipline
any thoughts on that like to have them I incorporate that has millions of ways has a household would have something to put in your life first of all you have to compartmentalize some private time for your physical health your mental health your spiritual health and you have to manage your whole household are you kidding this like the most self discipline
 let let let me be more clear please it is it's everybody's life is going to involve challenges
 but
 there's something to saying like
 fruits in order to directly
 elevate my spiritual understanding
 what can I voluntarily accept
 into my life that would help stimulate that
what what kind what kind of self-discipline are austerity could it could directly influence that
 cuz everybody's got to go and you know take care of their car and you know keep their home and do the things I need to do this cuz I'm not saying those things they do need to be seen in relation to it nobody someone wanted something special private time with you and your reading you and your journaling you and you're chanting but it's it's it's a private thing that in can be challenging even yeah yeah yeah I always say when you get when you get good at that you expand a little bit more and that's exactly where I was about to go over there and then you can spend and what you get good at morning you go to evening
 see what I was going to say even just waking up earlier right now
like I think almost anyone could say if I woke up one hour earlier in the morning and really use that time well it would dramatically affect my life and and purse to our spiritual practitioner like it would really fat meister's like I'm you know we have a tendency to lie around in bed we have Tennessee to stay up late wasting time and therefore not having a hard time getting out of bed there's a moment when your when you wake up where you can just think I could just lie around longer why not and right there if there's a choice I'd like to accept it so it's like that damn snooze button it's like them way to start your day with and you could end and you could and then later in the day you might feel that you were going to say that there's something either there's what was itself is when our regret ya later and later on if you don't choose the pain of pulling your Tomasek
body out of that bed
 you you might later in the day feel the regret of my time just said bye I had no time for my spiritual practice and if I would have gotten out of bed I would have had a really good hour that I wish I had now
 yeah you know what I struggle with
 what is wrong with her I struggle with sometimes like or appropriate things I have to use my phone or I have to use Instagram even cuz for a business stuff wrapped answer messages on Instagram for people writing me about programs at 10 they take what they compartmentalize like okay phone you go over here you get in a locked box or something I'm going to use you with this time of day and that's it yes but even that's hard because sometimes you need it
the certain things nowadays certain things are fast faster moving although I do have a lot of friends who are like these Flip Flip Flip phone people do you get a lot of people are like armor types that are just like I'm not playing the game I'm a flip phone until majan if you were flip phone guy and you did your Social Media stuff like you know yeah a little bit a little bit here in a little bit there but you did you didn't have a concert in your pocket all day it's it's nice and he's flipped especially I'm dealing you know sometimes when you're dealing with kids and you're trying to like arrange a playdate and it's sort of very time-sensitive and I'm dealing with a flip phone mom and she's I was like damn I need her now she's not on her phone that's a problem. It's a beautiful Freedom you get maybe I should be a flip phone Dad maybe that should about it I should be a flip for I could see you as a flip phone her I couldn't see Linda Lynn
what does a flip phone or you know I definitely use a flip phone I definitely use it at times of the day if it is convenient to check this out and do that or search for that you know I do things like the bicycles in New York City or tied at now everything to get tied into you know like if I do it it's really Insidious we were like all thank God it's all tied together and now we're like oh my God I felt I had the kids all tied together
 worldwide any case all the more reason why we got to try to very intentionally
 find where we need to push ourselves that extra step take on a little austerity make it real make it meaningful well there's the accountability of say this many times like we started this podcast for the number one reason I needed accountability for I want to read the bug with him everyday I don't want the the bog of a tie
as a decoration on my shelf I want it active active-active relationship but I'm 58 years old I want to read the bottom of Tom a few more times front-to-back I want to read the Tri-County Church Rita front to back when we get a many times over before I die these are you know this is the fabric of who we are and I should be able to go through this on a regular basis
 so we end we had with with with with the wishmas ages Community have accountability which is wonderful you know we have accountability and then with our Sage groups we have accountability which by the way I'm getting more and more positive feedback the time so that's accountability you're saying we need personal accountability when we are alone and hey don't hit snooze get up right now don't me and her off into the darkness that at night
put that time aside
 anyway that that's what happened I've been working on writing down stories in Krishna Leela been working on that so I brought my book upstairs at the computer upstairs and put them type it all out and I've got right onto YouTube and went right to motorcycle reviews and it was like I was like I woke up in the middle of the night like what I hear a motorcycle review I just lost 45 minutes of my life and in your something like that right when you get once you start scrolling like that you know what cha Fuji who is one of our age group leader she does she does or one of our Spanish age groups she shared this this goes right to a drug and I thought you were sharing regarding that regret that one feels when they don't apply self-discipline she shares from the psychiatric study It quotes when the when the exam
all this information the investigators found that people who are genetically predisposed people if they're imposing that on this but they write people who are genetically predisposed to getting up 1 hour earlier in the morning
 compared with the later risers had a 23% lower risk of depression
 yeah but it just seemed right like I didn't waste my day what does he know that that feeling of regret you know I'm not accomplishments meaning for me because the world is eating up all the rest of my time and I haven't had the self-discipline to to carve out some time for what I feel is most important
 that's when the Harvard Health. Harvard.edu mind and mood / waking up one hour earlier than usual May reduce depression
weird weird I note Hammer videos bird say that again
 you're you're you're lagging a little today Rowena
 how is not only lag and he's freezing up on us like a microburst rainstorm here do is that what it is and it screws up with the internet so anyway we are in the Shoot-Out by what time are you ready for I'm running some writing on the musketeer on that I'm driving to those two mom gave him so that's what time we have something to do with the area before he's trying to shoot my dog with Tom witches are very needs a conquest when should I pre-set for a base and sees to the Supreme Lord and Ryan and Jen are in a ride we see the super most human being a terrorist watch list of learning disability office today of the author not stop radiation about Reese you need somebody to talk to you about a nice turkey
but regular Technician classes in the Bible time and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the heart becomes the Supreme Lord who is raised will be established as in a revocable fact home again at the Melendez as my teachers are open in my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I have to grab a since he's at their Lotus feet with Tom Canto 7 chapter tel-twelve text
 or text form is it for 3 to finish three yesterday so we should be on for
 explore
 tearing couch grass in his hand couch grass
up pampas grass is an auspicious grass that I'm going to get in India you can get Cuccia grass mats ever have one of those yeah I want us out on them for sure nice to have one when I get Pooja 270 grass mat
 I wonder what the Latin name for Coosa grass is but anyway it should auspicious grass like a large grass
 like an ornamental grass I think being call alright Karen Cuccia grass in his hand the brahmacharya should dress regularly regularly with a belt of straw
 I never do that is in the ashram belt of straw and with deerskin garments and have to do that to it was actually frowned upon your skin Carmen, right people want to have to meet you should wear matted hair that would have been cool
we could have been more attractive if we were all dreading Distributing are books in the airport with with dreadlocks I would have bought one box game
 the desert would have attracted
 I'm going to fix it cuz you be okay with dreadlocks and Buckskin and a grass belt I would have bought one ever told me I was like you recommend this book I'll take it only picture you with my Frozen doll or know what is the alternate names that says burning bush Mexican firewood Fireweed mock Cypress Summer Cypress, and Keisha Mexican Fireweed
say something else to me like
 we hate our grades directly for livestock feed give me planning for soil erosion control and buy remediation of some contaminated sites is used in some Asian cultures for food and in some parts of Europe and Asia is planning for making brooms
 okay all right but as a whole nother thing going on in the traditional datacontext right it's always their uses belts the priests make a little ring out of couch grass when they're doing their ritual you know I'm one finger interesting and their mats are made out of crucial grass to considered important you know to to use that I think Matt and then a deer skin when you sit down to do your meditation or maybe chapter and think I think we should maybe mention there
 okay so he's just dressed in the deerskin and the couch Grass Valley
it also makes me think like there's different standards applied in different ways it's so many different ways they're thoughtful but we need to be careful not to like say this is the way and the only way this is one recommendation because there's a Pastime in the cheat on a chart in Rito right where who was it was it on
 one of the future X Associates appears one day and a deerskin
 really yeah and entreated Tanya actually looks away from him and says that can was it, none to pray for some reason that names in my mind that I may be wrong about that but it lets you say was he says that cannot be permitted to pour tea that I see because that he would never be wearing a deerskin you know you can look it up will get that go get to the banner
 so he frowned upon a time you frowned upon it upon it for at least for that person I thought bringing it back
it could be brought back here we go bring it back
 okay the brahmacharya should go out in the morning and the evening to collect them so that you didn't used to the matted hair but I don't think you read the whole rest now and I think I broke into laughter and yes you were mad at hair carry a rod and a water pot and be decorated with a sacred thread as recommended in the shastri's who's got a little begging bowl or water pot you know like people always carry water out there nowadays I did that when we were kids everyone's got some water he's just as good a drinking fountain or something if he owes you kidding they can beg with that little pot that can carry water to going on a long walk because you know there weren't so many water sources for drinking water back then to you know like if you're going on a long journey
 from another bar to thank you that's who it was from another
she was the one I was wearing the deerskin okay you got the message and I switched it up next day.
 Okay less controversial Garb yes
 if I would try
 Roundtree collect arms he should offer already collect on the spiritual Master want to read the whole sentence the barometer I should go out in the morning and the evening to collect arms and he should offer all that he collects to disperse the master with a kind of cult is this yeah he should eat only if order to take Blue by the spiritual Master this is the anti called Network would be all over there if the spiritual Master does not give us order that sends against our descent to you know you're not your
breaking it all up and people won't be able to put it together
 you should eat only if ordered to take food with a spiritual Master otherwise if this person Master does not give this order he may sometimes have to fast interesting interesting yeah you know that that would be so criticize right now
 people just don't understand I live this life I actually live this life like literally I live this life but I didn't just do it morning and in the evening I did it all day but you know and you know that the whole idea of like Hari Krishna devotees going on stopping people and selling books so you know in so many ways on one hand you know I totally get it where people see a card why are they creating such a nuisance
 yeah and I think it's so many people have done it's been sitting in sensitively without sensitivity and so therefore devel
that it from the very beginning there was a real effort to walk out and and represent yourself represent a tradition rather than just be a Salesman you know it in in a sense of competition got blended into it as well that wasn't always so healthy but on the other hand my memories of my own personal experience with it and I did it for 13 years right for 13 years I go out every day sometimes when you know like right now in this city is so hot is a crazy hot now you know yes crazy hot and I hate it I hate part of New York City I think I don't want me to hear that is hot but it's the stone gets hotter than yeah yeah yeah yeah but but but you know what we used to go out all summer and sell these books and like we used to do it in huge Park concert parking lots UV walk with
cars that are baking hot with burning hot engines in them you don't you just be like a hundred a hundred degree day would feel like 115 degrees you can do is shower and we would take on that austerity but we really we really felt like like this that we're going out on behalf of the guru who we had such respect for and we would collect downs but I text him like my Guru never saw a dime of what I collected right it was it was all just dumb there that like if someone to say look what they're doing I had to go out and collect his money and give it all away
 we were basically whatever we collected kind of just covered our basic expenses like built into the cost of the book
 right like likes the bottom of the Box fast-food with printed book
 and they would sell it for twice the printing cost to to us
and we would try to collect twice that we would average like twice that although we just asked for a donation but whatever went to the back to the BB&T to pay for half of that went to projects like my poor you know like building beautiful spiritual projects we felt great about that you know we felt like it was selfless service will put my foot it was selfish yes but my point is it wasn't like we felt we were being
 abused her manipulated or anything like that we we loved it and and we made enough to cover our basic living expenses go to India once a year and and everything else went to these projects if you were to feel abused or manipulated or bitter now
 it's like that's your problem if you really would be with the wrong attitude
if you go I've given so much if that was your attitude you did it in the wrong attitude in the first place I'm going to say you did something cuz sometimes you hear people who sacrifice and they have the bitterness to them it's like yeah it was saver treated like say but don't treat it like you want all these things in return for it or it's not savor
 like you know really my feelings aren't as are saying earlier entirely the opposite I felt like it was such a way to live this traditional life wears a simple brahmacharya you know you're sleeping on the floor you're the you know you're traveling around you you practically own nothing and you go out on the street and you meet people
 and
 you are with humility
 kind of present something to the end then you tolerate what comes back at you look sometimes
sometimes people would greet me like
 they just thought what I was doing was the most wonderful thing but I was like how you just this is what you do when they think I've been looking for this book I've been looking for this or look at your lifestyle this is amazing and other people to be like you are the devil or The Biggest Loser I've ever met you would get all of this you get people that were being sweet to you you get people to be incredibly impolite or even cruel to you and it would give you the ideal form in which the practice even mind that whatever comes at me today I accept in my service to God and it and I do it on behalf of my Guru I do not have a shield prop I do and we have all the great Saints in our tradition it was just a wonderful incredible in you do it everyday I have to do that for years
 it's it's a very powerful Young
yeah if you do that in the right Consciousness you're free you're you evolve if you do it and if you're holding onto any type of bitterness undone all the good you've done
 yeah it's a tellarite to the board that he says I can appeal brought in so much money we didn't know what where it went that was not even our duty to know where it went and wasn't our responsibility I responsible while doing a selfless activity and if you did that at work and whoever he was in charge of that loot their job was to take that and use it use it for something wonderful use it for something Wonder but but I really did know where it all went and and I was in honesty there was no one there was no there was no creepy Guru at the top that was like enjoying luxuries from it it just that didn't exist it was
 well spent
continuing on yes the Brahma cherry or one who has not accepted the gray house to ashram fan. I think I skipped a should be quite well behaved or collect more than necessary right oftentimes householders you can't do this because you don't have a house you have a small apartment so you cannot collect more than necessary there's nowhere to put anything in your house everything is
 I don't even know where you put your stuff you must have no stuff we talked about I got cabinets every moment I got a basement
elector a Brahma Cherry the superintendent in both of my buildings have commented that when they walk into our apartment they said all while there's space in here because everybody else stuff she crammed over collecting with them right now so you can cram it if you want if you have space you filled with junk that's just how it is, he must always be active an expert fully believing in the instructions of the spiritual Master the shastras bully controlling a census he should associate only as much as necessary with women or those controlled by women a lot to talk about the men here yes who are generally voice yeah boy so who were who were generally driven by their lower Passions
 that's part of being a man it's not just like I feel like being a man part of being a man is being embodied in
Mal Beast male meat puppet that we're driving around in which is now driven from the belly down okay that is the propulsion of this machine I mean if you think about this you're an 8 year old boy
 you're getting trained by a man or men that you admire write for their knowledge for the peacefulness for their compassion for their self discipline
 for the wisdom and you're being trained that you're going to do what you going to get married down the road there's time for that don't worry about that that's all going to be taken care of when you get there but for now
 let's keep your mind focused on learning you know like we were having girlfriends when we like how old do you like you got it you know it's like
 I think I was like in sixth grade when I had my first girlfriend right so that would May
I had a girlfriend since kindergarten at like 11 years old or some girlfriends since kindergarten you her name if you want what is her name was searching up the side young lady on Instagram post about who knows grade of my existence of a girlfriend this verse is probably going to you know that the trigger a lot of ideas but think about it carefully right we grew up not only having like thinking all I need to have a girlfriend now at a very young age but then also just being fed constantly non-stop movies and television shows and music that representing us ideas about love and sexuality and so on
 that
 where is very unhealthy Actually I don't even know how I learned anything in school
pornography that any kid just has it like you know just like we're yet so here was and I did like we want to train you to be a good man we want to train you to be self-disciplined we want to change it to be spiritual and compassionate and knowledgeable and we're going to spend this time with it and you're not going to have to think about sexuality right we're going to limit your your association with girls and we're going to keep it very simple now it's like going on vacation from your mind cuz my all of that you're mine doesn't need all that right now I'm just going to share with you every waking moment of my of my elementary junior high and high school was how can I get with a girl how can I be with the girls we're going to Colonial Williamsburg how can I get with a girl how can I see the girl everything every learning experience was tied with how can I be with a gun and your and your your
 sensible
and it is tied to it I love her if I don't have one what are people going to think of me if I don't if I don't have them this cool enough for attracting enough that I'm at my status is going down
 it was it was a breath when I first heard that idea of sense control it but Imma Try was like oh that would be interesting what am I going to even think about then because there's something else I think about your they opened it up doesn't it always thinking propensity that said this this connection between boys and girls are men and women is very important is very meaningful it should be it should be going into very thoughtfully
 and what the way we got brought up is with I just run wild and we're going to pump you full of like crazy information that she's going to get you all kind of confused and depressed and anxious and and Disturbed and distracted from
what's valuable in life right now at this time and end and when it comes time for you to sexuality will be part of your life connection with the opposite sex will be an important part of your life you're going to go into that as of as a as a virtuous well-disciplined young man like yeah of course of course we should be doing that everything I can to the sex game to it's like you've Enter the Matrix that's the beginning of your blind
 all right we're also said you should be well behaved and gentle rain. You are so am I ruined and I'm basically.
Rob broken were all ruined we just accept that but well behaved and gentle this means you need to learn how to be sensitive to others you need to learn how to get you need to learn to care about not not just because living in your own bubble we're all you care about is your own experience shut up mom I want to watch TV now you need to learn to really care about others to respect others you should not eat or collect more than necessary I were learning when we look at the Brahma tries like saying that your party Temple right there have like 80 brahmacharya is living in this relatively small space where do you sleep you sleep there on that place on the floor with like 30 other guys yea it's like where do you keep your stuff you got this little box of a closet anything you own fits in that box otherwise you don't own it
 Daddy it's quite unbelievable and they bring in young men from the high
level universities in the differences with them is
 they were doing this stuff sort of like it's part of Indian culture to be a little self-control easier for them in the dirt bags that we were in the west they didn't grow up with their husbands culture because their culture was informed by text exactly like the ones are reading their families over generation families in America we don't even have families
 we become like the parents often times to our parents often times you know it in India Hindu Dharma it still have an altar in their house they have pictures of the grandparents on their altar right Bart give me a formal portrait
yeah Benny Avila did it with your parents European do
 thumbs up
 no no, it's okay it's not like that anymore though yeah I know it also mentions that they must be active an expert
 the Promontory active an expert what is what you do like you take it you get taste like getting trained of them by my girl right
 it was like he was intolerant towards what would be the act at the opposite of expert towards like laziness law confidence in confidence and competence hey where the hell is your head at get it straight we've got important work to do and in your your your wandering around like a lost clown
get your ear. Like that kind of like pressure was that her head like a Grace because he was like in order to serve my boo I had to become confident
 why are you commenting we needed as like 22 year old boy really needed it yeah I was incompetent your groupset sent you to my group just to get this here is like you go to come out Krishna goswami you spend the summer with him and we'll see what you look like when you come back to Camp Hill Team Six of the hairy krishnas expert you got to be seriously determined to get your act together
 and it's fully believing in the instructions of of the spiritual master in the Shasha of these sacred texts you know really learning them understanding them strengthening your faith in them understanding letting them learn
how to let them guide
 your your your decision-making you know as you move through the day as you move through your your years in your life just keeps going with stuff for going to run out of time okay
 well behaved fix a burn from a cherry or one who has not accepted the Greyhound to us how much Richard leavoy has passion means
 we have to ask mom is like to have a griot to have a home and okay I'm a married life family law, cherry or one was not accepted the Family Life must rigidly avoid talking with women or about women you know why that's very very interesting percent literally just finish it so powerful that they eat they may have to take even the mind of a Sania a member of the renowned sort of life let me just share this with you when I was a Brahma Cherry it was hard enough to stop and gauging
sexual activity that that was that was a hard discipline to do if you've been engaging in it anything like that no girls nothing that cannot with yourself nothing you did it end in so then you started to realize that you can't even
 if you want to maintain that celibacy you can't talk about sex and a big part of being a boy I can't speak up for women here but is talking about sexual encounters that was what we did in the locker room in the football team or with your friend ever and I remember when I became a devotee that language I had nothing might mine on devoted friends I've nothing to talk to them about cuz that's all we talked about was like I don't have it in people that I had nothing to say to any more cuz I wasn't going to talk like that anymore and I realized like this is occupying so much of my conversation
so much my relationships have to do with me just talkin about girls and they woke me up to where my conscience was was at the following exactly the point that you're making
 if it's definitely triggering for us to hear that oh they shouldn't talk about women what the hell but if you actually I know what it means if you actually took the if you just took the the average if you if you could take a teenager in hot Mike mm
 a nod a teenage boy and how to make them and then take and then headed out all that they said talking about girls
 they would say nothing you know what island what do you mean take a day's yeah the other talking at it out
call Dad and then examine it for quality
