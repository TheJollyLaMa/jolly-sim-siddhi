Mara your factory recovery meetings at 12 and 9 p.m. eastern Time online and then went back to Recovery Group meetings in person and Maya Park actually in Nashville
 yeah and I think there's still one space left for the wisdom of the sages or treat over Memorial Day weekend
 one spot left right jump on that you know is really nice way to cure time they closing here to atone for all the people came to the save a retreat and the kids showed up so my son and his friend they picked up the Redundant and they're 17 and then my daughter's boyfriend came he played cartels and just to see these kids to sit down the kirtan like pros and you know this is what they're doing in the Teenage life I just sit in and I can tell you everybody that was there we were all of our hearts were like touched by watching them just sit there
rock this keertana was so like beautiful to witness
 it is good you hoping all right so let's dive into life here today I've got a good nugget
 it's from one of your friends in mind Anonymous you might know him
 and this is what it is we don't see things as they are
 we see them as we are see things as they are we see right we lose something in our subjectivity
 we don't see things as they are we see things as we are you know what this reminds me of when I was a brahmacharya
 you don't know what a barometer is like a it's like a celibate student and for guys
22 years old 23 years old try to be celibate and culture today considered one is very difficult
 and I remember I would have people come up to me and say you're lying you're you're completely they just couldn't believe it
 I just did it didn't fit within the realm of even possibility for a young man under 20 Steven do that because we have this idea of what the world is like
 and
 inbox see what happens if we find we meet people that are just not acting like the rest of the world and we start to think oh wow
 you can do that you can behave like that you can act like that you can talk like that you can think like that this is what you can do in your spare time and when those things are either suck dick or should have sent back when they are either in the mode of goodness
find goodness or out-of-this-world goodness it becomes incredibly attractive
 and that's what sort of it perhaps that is why we're all here today someone's reached in to our hearts and touched our hearts and then we just really want to sort of raised the bar in our life and our spiritual life I really think it's important on a regular basis to sort of as well when we wake up a good ritual is to just sort of meditate on those people that have come into our life in person could been through a book as a relaxer or something people that have reached into her life touched our hearts and said and give us a give us a chance to
 an option to upgrade our choices and that's one of the what we do in the morning when we do prayers to our teacher so it's given us a new Option almost like a new lease on life
 I think my back is
where are you going with this well it's actually you know it's unknown the origin of this that I read one article where they were researching this trying to find out you know where was first used and it's like all over the place. It's others have claimed it and
 is some that happened to our pictures the same for you and there we go okay I'm sorry so
 the idea you know if we look at this from the yogurt perspective this this idea we don't see things as they are we see them as we are you do we get frustrated I think it's in a why don't you see the way that I see it how could you see it that way you know why can't you see what I'm seeing you know but what do you always understand that every one of us is proceeding through the faculty of the mind right as it senses are like
the plug-in devices into the computer the mind and we don't look straight at the world we look at the world through the mind and through the senses and the mind is programmed with all kinds of
 all kinds of dispositional kind of predispositions you know like this dislikes and fears and untrusting more trusting attachments you know we've it all gets filtered through that and everybody's mind is programmed a little bit differently
 and so everybody seeing things a little bit differently your and then the question becomes you know
 are any of us in the truth is like the most important thing we could do is scrub our mind yeah rub the lens the question is what are the conditions for perceiving truth
like how this is kind of what the yogis are doing right there saying like Okay we all have these
 Disney's conditionings and envy suffer because of them you know because the demand is programmed to respond favorably to certain external stimuli and unfavorably to other external I wonder if I could experiment with my mind of one if I could reset it I wonder if I could set it in such a way where it cream ain't even no matter what the external stimuli is it on the OB to call that summertime you don't even mind in this and in our their practices that I can do or their disciplines that I could perform that will help me
 help help me cease to be
 I guess you could say a victim of or like you know under the control of this conditioning that's in my mind you know what could I do
you know that's kind of weird
 like when when facts about the Swami prabhupada when he would speak about Bhagavad Gita and srimad bhagwat Tom and in these practices about the yoga he he didn't like so much to call them religion often he was kind of speak that he was calling science and I or yoga that that we're doing some experiments here with with our perception and seeing how they can be trusted like like if you take something like the for regular two principles that are in a growing out of baggage, and proper kind of he use these as if you wanted to be his student is this is serious disciple
 then add your initiation you know ceremony at the ritual that you perform the right that you would pass through you would take a vow to follow these principles you know that were that had to do with your diet you know that it be what I had to do with compassion let's say that
compassionate diet
 had to do with your regulation you do sexually
 had to do with intoxication in your regulation of that or your urine
 what's the word I'm looking for a ride it was at the lab station that you have standing from that and gambling as well
 and so say all we have these religious rules we have to follow it, Lee you know you and I as we receive religious rules as we're going up there wasn't really an explanation if we weren't taught that these these are like part of an experiment on your Consciousness that to hear it hear the ideas no no these are these are conditions for truth perception but these are these are these are part of that experiments so we can see if we can get you beyond the condition of your mind so you can perceive
fruits and not just see things as your mind is programmed to see them it's almost like you got a house wash the windows down it just wash your windows it's springtime wash your windows it's not like it's a good thing it's what you do when you have a house it's what you do when you have Windows and so that it's the it's not even like this weird unique experiment it's just like let's just not let everything fall to pieces if you got a property if you got an apartment I've got a home and get a lawn you got to maintain it or it starts to like and she was at entropy want to start a life takes over itself in trapeze with his father's heart starts to fall apart
 and so we have there's got to be some maintenance so even those sanders Crock-Pot game it's not like that's like these huge things you got to do it's like what you do when you have a mind what you do when you have a body you got to clean the Consciousness are you going to see things wrong we don't want our bodies in mines and
thoughts to go on autopilot because if we don't do the the cleansing of the conscious is guess what someone else is going to program the Consciousness for us it's happening all the time go get hacked the computer I'll get her either either we carefully choose the files that we want to download and we carefully you know maintain the files on a computer and we put in through the anti-virus software you know you know regularly that's we have that choice or we are we open ourselves up to be enacted every moment what's a malware of the Mind
 so you know where we're reading Baba Tom where
 this mess I'm believable Avengers to place where Lord Vishnu manifests his half man half lion and and took out the demon that was harassing everyone harassing their very lives but everyone you know so we get in like this Universal perspective of what just happened people from this planet or relating
in that way and people from this Intergalactic species and saying you know it looking at it from another perspective in and you get all these different perspectives they're kind of mostly what we're hearing a worldly perspectives like perspectives through my temporary identity and bought a few of them in particular next chapter where it's all provided you know it's it'll be all provides prayers those are coming from another
 up an entirely different perspective not like at this relative perspective of you know what I'm on this planet and I have these responsibilities and it was you know when I enjoy these certain things in life and the demon Renny koshy poo had denied me all these things and now you said all that straight so I'm grateful to you that's like is coming it's a perspective this, it's a worldly perspective it's a it's a it's a specific World temporary
Monday and what's Encino perspective and we operate on that level we have to learn how to operate well on the 11th but there's also this
 you know level that's if that's beyond all those considerations and provide he's on that level where he's Beyond those cuz he's not going to come forward and say I was getting harassed by my father made life really tough thank you now life is better and I'll see you later like that which is something you will like what you get from a lot of these other prayers that were here
 you're good I was great that's a great quote I'm going to use it with a steel I can put my name on it I don't see things as they are as we are Rockin off 2024
 Rockin off from home to munch I'm going to even say it was part of my book and it wasn't
do I cure time this week at Jai yoga and Albany Albany is Dustin Amex place the other Jawga local come on down
 that's going to make a great sauce and a beautiful family
 I'm going to see them come around a bit more you know wrapped up in life right now but yeah I'm going to go up there they can come down here they came down to the farm and we'll do a retreat or something here
 alright let's dive into this sweet nectar huniepop what do you say
 I don't call it that but any of the text Harry and Honeypot for boo
 neck hair and I've never said that word I wasn't the body I would never say next herion now I say it all the time
 there I am the Mesquite Diner.
the area before he's out of the srimad bhagwat time which is a very means of Conquest one should offer respectful a base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan don't you know and Ryan Reese you the Super Bowl team and learning at the show the office today of the author not stop write a regular tennis class in the back of Tom and by rendering a service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with Transit at the songs will be established as in a revocable fact is born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open my eyes to the port side of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet
 beautiful she might block me Tom Canto 7 8:47 and this is
1318
 hey did you see the
 Northern Lights no
 you can't see New York City everybody seen the news and if anybody saw that put it up in the message board because they're out the northern lights are out and I think it was a clear night yesterday too I'm just too lazy to stay up to 2 in the morning to do it
 they're out there
 yeah here we go text 47 the inhabitants are so was kept having is all these different beings from different planets are offering prayers so we went through so many different beings on other planets some people call them aliens some but they're like in this these cases that are higher beings
maybe I'll beings may be all beings from other planets are higher beings
 maybe but these are the inhabitants of Naga loka's so these are and meanwhile the Vishnu Avatar
 nursing home on the Stringer is sitting on a throne
 but he's kind of like you just killed her when you catch Uber is kind of like his
 entirely spiritual
 anger of love
 is still in him and he said no but everybody is he still hot you know and everybody's kind of coming up a little bit shy a little bit a little bit and weary in offering different prayers
 sure if you've ever known someone is lost their cool and they get it back under control is sort of like that I sort of like the Hellcat they're still there still coming out of its everyone's a little intimidated but they're offering these prayers and Naga
Anagha Loke there's
 there's people that look like nagas do not I just said I'm just going to have to say that
 Naga is a snake when they were standing there they're in a full-on snake form or do you think they would like a human like you know I've seen them in two different forms like with half snake half human bodies I don't know if they have a yeah I don't know truthfully
 it's interesting the most simple hiranyakashipu took away all the jewels on our hoods that they say that in these Woods are snakes yeah they have jewels on the hoods
 I did that just answered a question I guess I guess so the most simple-minded I should put took away all the jewels on our hoods and all our beautiful wives
 now since his chest has been pierced by your nails you are the source of all pleasures to our wives that sweet together offer respect labason sisu even higher beings from other planets were tortured by
cashew Pooh and so now that everyone's feeling great relief. He has appeared for that in the string of David's appeared and and just giving safety
 in Willits again everybody's looking at it from a different perspective right it's like some like some I have just witness with a saw
 this is battle in this is manifestation first of of Vishnu in this wild incredibly beautiful on insanely powerful in an incredibly intense the angry for him you know it's like that's pretty wonderous and butt and then you know seeing deeper into it that this is a manifestation of love and I mean I think we all feel a little long and you know there's like another kind of real phenomenon going out do you know Tik-Tok
whatever phenomenon going on now you know where they give you pricing it whatever I see my new too I guess but you ever see those things would like to set up this thing where they put like a child
 in like a park sitting sitting next to like a stranger like like a Robert I love Robert Childs or real child a child and then they have someone come up and begin to ask the child like come with me you know like you know I'll take you to your mother or whatever like I made you a like a sting operation it's not exactly a sting it's more like because of the person that's posing as like the potential child abuser okay is
 is it an actor
 and the child 2:10 and so they're just trying to see what's going to be the reaction to
Ocean City next to the child when a stranger comes up to the child that they don't know oh oh yeah yeah and begins to try to take the child away and then and then the child says something like
 it says something to indicate that you know they don't know the person you've been punked bright and the end then the person sitting next to a child you know, something awakens in them
 like how there's something very dangerous going on here and then they turn to the name of the actor in the state are they turn to the child so do you know this person in this house is now and then they jelly stand up at that point you know they stand up from the bench and they kind of getting a face to get between the child in the in the person and they end up in the person say no I know their parents or something like that you know right and end and then you begin to see that the person start to get more angry and they could that you start to see like that they begin to manifest a certain Baba where can I get started for a protective anger bear
like hey you better step off right now and I'm going to call the police I'm going to let you know I'm going to do this I'm going to do that and it's really kind of highlighting it is kind of like these videos are kind of glorifying the person's reaction right like okay look at this is a good thing a person standing up and protecting an innocent person but let's observe it let's appreciate it when we just saw the ultimate manifestation of that here you know where the shrink a day just took my point is is that the the deeper back to Yogi's
 do you know have a deeper understanding more more deep than these residents of Naga Loca
 they're looking they're the from their perspective watches happens when we saw the most magnificent a wonder is demonstration or display of a particular Flavor of Love that God has for his devotee wow
that's that's one perspective the nagas do not on that level
 their perspective is you know what this team and came and took away our or Jewels or Jewels or why when or why you restored it thank you you know so Bob and Tom is always kind of juxtaposing these deeply devotional perspectives with Vedic perspective appreciating God you know it's Aveda perspective but it's from a rose from a material point of view and nuanced point of view yeah but I'd say it's like you know if a crew to point for you you know that all they can appreciate it I know I don't want it all but what they're expressing hear what sounds like they just want their wives for sex they might have just like the comfort of their partner but I'm still a ways from their own kind of somewhat narrow
perspectives that they're saying oh grade you gave me back the things that I lost thank you right you know the things of this world that I lost thank you even though what they just saw was something that the the deeper sages will meditate on and write books about into you know it comment on his home because it's so profoundly spiritual lose everything they'll lose everything just to have that Vision in there okay to be able to really perceive it clearly there to really understand what's going on
 yeah that's a great point would it be like to go to Nada Loca
 and is not a local 14 sounds like a whole series of planets I don't know that the answer to that
 what are you know the names of the lower planets
found them I guess I can remember them at all I can think of off the top of my head but is one NADA Loca but one of them because there's like a discs or seven planetary systems but I don't think one is not. But if it is that means planets of these sneaky people I wonder if she's on other on other planets within this universe and then you got to wonder are they exactly like us or do they have four fingers or do they have a different shade of Santa simply a maroon maroon skin ever wonder like that but you know what are we need to humanoid so I haven't answered your question no Naga Locos not like one of the planetary systems okay so which one particular plan on going down from the earth level from
or Loca okay what you love or I'll tell her Loca vida loca loca loca loca loca loca how tall is the bottom of the barrel that's when you say go to hell and you're really angry that's where you mean go there
 and there's a lot of planets within those locusts steals our Grace is asking is
 is Pat allocco nagaloka the same cachet Shazam there I think Chase is actually below part of the local if I understand correctly it's not actually they're on the level about the local be below it
 if I'm remembering correctly okay very little interest in Squirrel we did it we did the Naga now the maannews another monitor
 do you know the the human head there humans
what are the origins of the human species these are big-time leaders kind of likes Universal leaders for extremely long periods of time just look at this planet like soil and we've been seated we've been seated by the mono's and print shop at ease and they're from higher planets in this business chest just like a garden but we didn't grow from this Earth we're all from outer space probably all different planets and mushrooms an octopus or from a completely different planet or sure let's go continue
 well that's just one second just a little bit more about the minors if I don't like within the day of Burma or the luck you know the life of Vermont
 they're 14 different models come and go oh good you did a little research on this one but I think that's sweet
welcome time there's 14 Manos who's also a huge chunks of time whatever 25 presidents of the United States write something like that yeah that's were talking about you within a day that was intense and I believe there's sound level of universal destruction and Recreation and you know each time
 yeah you going to Manu who's kind of like the another kind of known as like the lawgivers I said that if they play this essential Universal rolls kind of laying down the bog and a swamp Romano's in important I guess that he's r4r
. It's fine woman and a case they're just consider them you know these monitors is like super high level important dignitaries you know
let's see what they say here here's what they say see what perspective they see this through what they just witnessed you know how to measure in 25 American Presidents just show up in front of them in the day of and they told Rose about takes off his hat
 as your order carriers oh Lord we the monitors they all spoke with a slight British accent because of a temporary supremacy of this great demon around the cashew Pooh laws for maintaining Banos from Dharma or destroyed okay oh Lord now that you have killed this great demon we are Ellen normal condition kindly order us your Eternal servant what to do now so they were creating the order of the universe give me the laws rights had been discarded by her in your coochie poo so their perspective is weave
it's it's a devotional. You know it is it's a servant's prayer here right we serve you by stylish and these laws they came around messed up all the laws you've reestablished it we're ready to serve you again
 stop rustic you know it's not like no rustic meaning
 understanding the the taste of Flavor of Love That was happening or not expressing anything from that level but they're expressing it from a dharmic level from a from a servant's level now those are Japanese these are the people who are the progenitor and I love this concept the progenitors of the universe speech all species imagine that measure a job but they giving birth to a human boy a girl and then something else a young chimpanzee
it would make more sense and old chimpanzee giving personal to elderly chimpanzee lady
 you're giving birth in a bit of a mango seed comes out of you according to our philosophy there are these people that give birth to every species of Life how crazy is that but too but I think we need to think about it I don't you know it's not necessary that they were born from their bodies a good point it's not like they came back and the doctor saying oh she out that picture app life different species somehow they could design it
with their minds apparently I don't know very much about this you know what I'm giving a very its kind of guesswork on my part but from what I remember and you know somehow they could design all the different species like you know there's this DNA codes in all of that sure why not take a design that cold imagine it's like seed is coming out of you all the different varieties of mangoes but I don't even think of it as seats though I think I'm summer seats
 right well I'm just I'm not even addressing that I kind of think of it on that this the more find level like I do I don't know what do I know about DNA and then all this would like her to majan if you look at like your DNA in My DNA identical they're going to do a lot of good be the same just because you're both humans and
Turbo snail and in inside but then there be difference is obviously and then you know so then if you took all the humans and looked at their DNA so I got like a computer chip with codeine in it and so much of it has the human coating into but then it has its individualize coating as well okay and then I don't know why they think so forgive me and then if you're looking at the DNA of an animal is going to pretend like an animal that's like an ape let's say it's going to be it's going to its coding is going to be closer to that of a human then say caterpillar yeah and then if you get to a tree you know you're still more room right to a tree but I assume they all have DNA or something that's like
 and I wish I knew maybe someone on a chap or knows more about biology and so any case but that unit we can imagine that these poor job duties in their minds they would like basically doing this computer programming
 write your little crew creating the codes by which diff
species different forms of life whether they created or not like for example I didn't create that I didn't have a baby but imagine if they like a lady doesn't create the codes of DNA of having a child they just do it they don't even play their role do what is their role may be there for Japanese don't even know what's happening throughout their body they just do it like a like a chicken just lays eggs not thinking like time to LAX is a Japanese or just like okay now thinks they're getting born out of my mind out of my third eye on my fingertips out of my I need there's also there's certainly also the idea that they're doing a bottle as well because like we see the property daksha
 he was able to create like thousands of suns and he was very concerned that they would all be put job duties also indicate that you know like physically he needed them physically to be able to carry this out
 any case start grinding on a message board says vittala vittala and Naga Loca are Sonata
I think of stupid is Right Shay she lives on the bottom of the table so Potala and Naga Locust Anonymous so that's the snakes down there
 inhale I believe that if there is a hell people then there's snakes they're there spiders there are slugs
 is cocoons from from their perspective as these progenitor has how did they what's in their minds right now is they approach or Bishop
 you should a Japanese say
 the Supreme lord lord of even Burma and sheba we the properties were created by you to execute your orders but we are forbidden by Randy country poo to create any more good progeny as a good project is also part of what they have to do
 but it's not just like they're pumping out speed
but they're also trying to create good beings that will I suppose also have their Universal responsibilities and good dharmik kids
 well someone's got to create the bad ones too
 interesting now the demon is lying dead before us his chest pierced by you let us therefore offer expect the base in season 2 you who's incarnation in this form of pure goodness is meant for the welfare of the entire universe know Kayla is still forever based on Whose incarnation in this form of pure goodness this isn't a material form this is Sue decipher
 is meant for the welfare of the entire universe interesting thing is right off the bat he's kind of helping us understand the categories
 you're the Lord of even Vermont Sheba amongst us Davis
didn't he could imagine so many but he mentioned those two indicating that they have a higher status amongst the Davis
 and that he stood Vishnu still higher so he's get there they're giving us is gradation or this higher key in terms of universal status in terms of you know we had a duty to carry out on your behalf
 are any car she poop prevented us from carrying it out now he's dead and we're ready to serve again okay somebody's
 somebody search for gandharvas Loca is that is that is that a planet instead of whole layers or system it's not play with her system somebody star girl he did some research do some fact-checking where they can darbus from these are the musical Singing Angels
 do their necks okay it's like what they look like they look like human in miles
things can you touch them are the Ethereal I think their bodies are not like our bodies right
 very interesting and they're somehow connected with music of course Corona from Glendora local we know that, but the question is on what planetary system the other part of a bigger system Planet everybody singing on those planets are they all sing the same things or their playlist okay your lordship we are very your lordship we ever engage in your service by dancing and by singing in Germanic performance is so this is like a different mood than everybody else has a really responsible for the TV show they're all like performing artists
 only different mood now right
 and then they had just performed so they're kind of like probably just like a little sweaty and smelly
just performs drama students we ever engage in your service by dancing and singing and dramatic performances but this hiranyakashipu by the influences of his bodily strength and Valor brought us under his subjugation miserable now he has been brought to this low condition by your lordship what benefit can result from the activities of such an upstart as for any cuz she poo something like let's say you know, this government takes over and yes I did now you do music for the the state South Korea the Communist Russia and North Korea North Korea
feeling like subjugated in those places like almost helpless is that how you pictured
 is that how I what I said how you picture it are you sure they're not just you know living for the people there it's not at why cuz they haven't worked on themselves you know and then the power goes to one person that person hasn't dealt with how to handle power switches in this miserable subjugated life
 where are they letting that they naturally their their natural inclination is to sing songs and glorification of Vishnu maybe occasionally have to do like an injured gig antibodies isn't worthy first
but now you can or find me they just going to have to swallow that I couldn't do what they were born to do so now he's been brought under this low condition by your lordship what kind of fish can result from the activities of such an upstart is her new car cheap ooh yeah stabbing happened some Chara no Loca Chara Chara forgetting what do the China Star
 someone help with that Chimera look it up
 that won't here's what I said oh Lord because you have destroyed the demon hiranyakashipu who is always a steak in the hearts of all honest men I'll even like a stake in your foot would be horrible this weekend
 we are now really then we eternally take shelter of your Lotus feet which award the
so Liberation from materialistic contamination what you got for us
 pendarvis are from dinner alone as being very honest with her also singer star groggy says combating sing it like a like a dueling banjos okay
 the inhabitants of a yuk shallow kind of these are mystical beings
 the inhabitants of yaksha Loca sprayed oh controller of the 24 elements we are considered the best Servants of your lordship because of rendering service pleasing to you yet we engaged as Pelican carriers by the order of her anything she poo the son of Duty
it's usually benevolent but sometimes mischievous connected with water Rotella T freeze the forest treasure and Wilderness for what nature Spirits for Spiritual water Spirits Mission and Medieval Era temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia is garden guardian deities garden garden. These are what is maybe the Seven Dwarfs heigh there anything like elves
 aren't elves like nothing would they aren't they live in the forest but it'll people would call mythological beings they sound elfish and Zack are in the palanquin of here on your coochie poo
other very strong elves
 give it to the bigger else to carry all over four elements
 we are consulted at 10 elements of the six universal elements are they popped out of the trees
 you know sometimes I talk of like the lord of the forest you know somebody Lorax OK Google, 24 elements we are considered the best Servants of your lordship because of rendering services to you
yeah we engaged as poliquin carriers by the order for any cashew Pooh the son of DT right Lord in the form of the string a Dave you know how this demon gave trouble to everyone but now you have killed him and this body is mixing with the five material elements see due to these tyrants tyrants the Stalin's of the universe you can't do it you're great at you just got to serve the seals that independent
 artistic urge
 but what Google OK Google send a text what do you make of the yaksha's
 I think they're for like dwelling Spirits look at that we know of them justice as expressed through this
what was the first thing this is a to stand before the vision they say this we are considered the best service of your lordship
 because of rendering service is pleasing to you I think that is you know is it's a
