 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from the goulburn on eco Village and beautiful Maharashtra this is wisdom of the ages of daily yoga podcast with your house right now that co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center New York stupid us welcome to show everyone it's Fridays it's Thursday's study of the shoe my Bonnet on Thursday Thursday study that you were here live with Tara and Mara
 is it today I'm here or here with them
 you're all blown out today with the white today and I don't know why I'm still a little jet-lagged
that's the mosquitoes in my room driving me insane last night cuz then you got the next snap I got the mosquito Nets and some very excited what's going on with you or the echo village with people today that was a nice very nice that was nice this project at every time you just poke a little here and there you find other doing other incredible things that can work up his mind like today we took a group which I took him around it was only a short to where I was about an hour and a half which means you can only text you in a little bit and they took a sin to where they have the compost they do the composting with the cow dung and they developed as fertilizer out of it and then they said that there's seventy Villages around this equal Village
 and you know like big kind of Industries have kind of a huge problems with Indian farming in a sled to
suicide like being a huge issue but you know they all use pesticides chemical that chemical fertilizers right and they developed here they don't use any chemical fertilizers and they they use this whole system of developing this compost from the cowdog
 and then they go around and they share this with the lip neighbouring Villages and they're afraid that if we don't make money selling this organic food then the whole thing collapses you know and told me that he met recently met a man who was a farmer and he said he was wracked with guilt that he was feeding people always in his food that causes cancer and at the end he tried to go organic and in the first year he didn't make enough money and his family was begging you please just go back and now he's back in selling this
 toxic food and
and engine living a life racked with guilt about it so what they said here I never knew they said that in Indy 70 Villages around here all the different Pharmacy produce them and encourage them to learn how to create this compost in music composition not use any of the chemicals and force their concerns will make that money and so the the Golden Eagle Village says for the first year if you don't make money we will cover your loss out right out of the goodness of their heart. I'm just
 it's hard to put into words the at the how just how special this entire project has yeah no one could even imagine what it's been what it's growing into
 I feel like we were there on the ground floor but we still do the bigger vision of it I don't know if I want to say I don't know if anyone fully understand but once
Vision got off and started to snowball it can just text it seems like you can't just keep expanding so many different ways from you like your same building a hospital for the local people helping local people learn how to Market their the crafts helping them harvest the water helping them Farm helping to do so many things say they giving them all different types of education is just say yeah it's it just seems to go on and it's a perfect example two were saying yesterday like you would want to change the world in violation of his own or in with our spiritual life we work on our self what has that manifest wealth depends with a person's Karma like ramaswamy where he's meant to do big things in this world perhaps if he was it's hard to even imagine him as a Fearless maybe doing some big material project but because it's manifesting through his
 spiritual desires
it's just a mess of overwhelming beautiful spiritual thing his internal work has been his internal work is manifesting outwardly towards the world actually changed in the world in the world goes against everything these past aside companies they're like big Pharma you know now that they have a lot of like power and when that when people just get together see him but thanks for offering we're going to grow our own stuff
 you know who is really what was that one company that everyone wants and tell him I said I think they got a grip on these guys are just irresponsible and you know this this this project is not is not exactly like a self-sufficient farm community started itself Vision in many ways but it's not like entirely Off the Grid or anything like that you know they got a lot of a large portion of their energy comes from a solar power heater or comes from biogas here have a block away
in in that but it's not like it's an entirely self-sufficient Community but that's not exactly what it's designed to be it's designed to show models of how to improve things and demonstrate how they work and then share them with other people and doing a very effectively you know whether it would hurt again with a bee with a natural alternatives to pesticides or to fertilizers or how to harvest the water or on so many levels could just keeps expanding expanding and it's really working everybody from the group today I was sort of introduce ourselves to each other we have just like a stellar International Group Australian Swiss Germans and lots of Americans UK
 Italy Belgium yeah it's pretty cool
 you have something you would share today. Marys got some
mr. Sandman announcements
 I'm in here today at noon and 1:30 eastern time tomorrow we have to cancel tomorrow show it was special program going on here but there is still the Celtic Kane Asana class for a patron numbers at 10:30 a.m. eastern time for supporting us community-supported podcast it exists from you guys as hell podcast exist cuz you guys desire it go to patreon.com was in the sages and you can help us with any monthly pledge of your desire we appreciate it
 go see what you got some interesting story want to share a little bit really it's kind of like today but it sounds a lot of people had heard about it before I just recently came across it again and looked into it in more detail but we
read yesterday from Thomas Merton and his he was sharing a message there that in a sense we all think we want peace
 but commonly there are certain certain attachments that we have that mean that even when we think we're living a individually peaceful lifestyle a lot of are a lot of our habits necessitate a certain type of violence that manifests in the world than one way or another and so he was kind of challenging us to the two kind of dig deeper the end not to rather than lash out at others that we see as he use the term warmongers to look within oneself and see what's inside oneself that needs to be rooted out first okay so this was similar to that I thought this was similar to that in the sense that when we see something some some manifestation hate in the world
one simple reaction is just to call it out you know identify the yellow about it post stuff on our social media about it and so I'm sure one can question how really affected that is this is a story about someone that just said let me see what I can do he just took it on another level and so I read of it is what I'm reading is from an NPR article our story I guess and article
 if I can get this one second sorry about this
 I don't know how this is a brand new computer that I bought I may not be able to get this I may just have to tell this story without
 oh nuggets
I got full blessings from Chris to talk whatever I want I got it all right over here so this is about a man gentleman
 I named Daryl Davis
 in the store was until how one man could vents 200 coupe Klux Klan members to give up their robes so Darren Davis is a blues musician and he always has been freed from the article Dale Davis is a blues musician but he always has what some might call an interesting hobby for the past 30 years Davis a black man has spent time befriending members of the Ku Klux Klan which sounds almost
 I don't know impossible you just can't get it they're locked into a Persona that makes them an unmoved
Force are cemented into an identity it's so rather than just lash out at them he decided to befriend them which is it you know what an interesting way to go about it he says once the Friendship blossoms The Clansman realize that their hate may be misguided since David started talkin with these members he says 200 clansmen have given up their robes when that happens Davis collects the robes and keeps them in his home as a reminder of the dent and he is made on racism by simply sitting down and having dinner with people
 so so dinner with the clan he describes how it came about like how we got start at this nice he's a musician he was playing at some place piano and playing at some bar and after he's done playing some guy came up to him and said it wouldn't you know you play pretty good piano there and I never seen a black
play piano like that you know I just like Jerry Lee Lewis and his kind of like well you know Jerry Lee Lewis
 Bo Diddley Airway whoever whoever will not bow to the but whoever it was a little Richard Fats Domino people like that and that this guy was like I don't know about that and said they had a disagreement about that but it just led to them kind of sitting down and talking and in at a certain point of conversation the Ku Klux Klan member that this guy said to him you know you know why I've never really sat down and had a drink and talk with black man before and the guys like really well you know why not and then his friend was kind of nudge him sit down and tell him tell him you know so while I'm in there was a Ku Klux Klan and what he said when he first heard that robbery this is how we responded to you said his reaction to that was I just burst out laughing because I really didn't believe him I thought he was pulling my leg and as I was laughing he pulled out his wallet flip through his credit cards and pictures and produced
is Klan card and handed to me immediately I stop laughing I recognized the logo on their the clan symbol and I realize this was for real this guy wasn't joking and now I'm wondering why am I sitting by klansman but he was very friendly it was the music that brought us together he wanted me to call him and let him know anytime that I returned to this bar with his band The Back To The Clansman a black person could sit down at the same table and enjoy the same music that was a seed planted he said that was a seed planted so what do you do when you plant a seed you know that was the impetus for me to write a book I decided to go around the country and sit down with Clan leaders and clan members to find out how can you hate me when you don't even know me
 so it's just you know it's it's a
 it's a kind of thing to take to 200
did the Ku Klux Klan and get them to reconsider the whole way that really I don't know any Clans members but I assume that when you are One X is kind of like a large part of your identity sure you know and to get someone to let go of a large part of their identity as some of the stories are you having version will this is what he describes as an use it at work he said he describes he describes how it happened with like the first guy so he says it it's like this
 he said that
 he was he was driving in the car with one of them and he said the guy said to him well we all know that all black people have within the machine which makes them violent and he was like what are you talkin about
never committed any kind of violent crime or anything like that and he said he said well then that just means it's like late and in you but it's it comes out sooner or later so I said
 he said so how do you argue with somebody who was that far out in left field but a lot of people just give up at that point so how do you argue with someone that you said I was dumbfounded I'm just driving along and he's sitting there all smug and secure like see you have no response
 and and I thought about it for a minute and then I use his point of reference I said well we all know that all white people have a gene within the makes him a serial killer
 and i n e says what do you mean I said well maybe three black serial killers and he thought about it he couldn't do it and he said so I said Ted Bundy Jeffrey Dahmer Charles Manson and John Wayne Gracie all whites Laden
so he said so I said Son you are a serial killer and he says Daryl I never killed anybody and I said yeah but your Gene is Laden it hasn't come out yet and he goes well that's stupid I said well yeah but you know what you're right it is stupid but what I said was to have been no more stupid than what you said about me and said then he got very very quiet and change the subject five months later based on that conversation he left the clan his role was the first Roll by ever got so what he's talkin about this and you use the word conversion he says it's like this
 he says the best thing you can do is study up on the subject as much as you can I want an armed not with a weapon but with knowledge I knew as much about the clan if not more than many of the clan people that I interviewed that's interested let's try to understand how they came to make
perceptions have some emotional real emotional attachment to being adopting that they said when they see that you know about their organization their belief system they respect you whether they like you or not they respect the fact that you've done your homework just like any good sales when you want a return visit and they recognize that I done my homework which allowed me to come back again that began to chip away at their ideology because when two enemies are talkin they're not fighting it's when the talkin ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence if you spend five minutes with your worst enemy it doesn't have to be about race it could be about anything you'll find that you both have something in common
 as you build upon those commonalities you're forming a relationship and as you build about that relationship you're forming friendship that's what would happen I didn't convert anybody they saw the light and converted themselves
 and so
I think you know there's so many different responses in so many different Valley response but I think
 two large degree due to the the nature of the whole social media you know phenomenon that we're living in the no Society has ever lived in before in history where we feel pressure to represent ourselves to present ourselves as virtuous and in and we think that the formula for that is to lash out where Injustice and we're all doing that more more going back and forth to each other and it gets the point we're so confused you don't even we don't even understand what's Justin on just half the time anymore but we feel it's important to lash out in it and it's not bringing more peace people put pressing work tonight and you should you should make a statement your you not making a statement is if your fingernails are distressing, and it's not solving problems his idea was very different his
let me really study up and understand someone and come and approach him in a friendly way even if you do Ku Klux Klan of me that's just about as straight out you know straight-out hostile racist bigots bigoted throw this world like a video of your races for liking that this is the KKK member actual card carrying someone that has has not only putting out to talk but two hundred people that were deeply invested in it have walked away from it there's something to learn and how this man's the you know chosen to chosen to operate it also could see when you when you read it to me
 how do I summon someone send the message board
 that this person was on
going as well Tim Riley said Joe Rogan it just shows how these personas that were so locked into I am right Capo you know or I am this religion of this favor of this nationality of this political party with his political agenda how they're so fluid actually they're not in stone and when we begin to hate we forget that your hating someone that it's almost an apparition you're heading there not that being is not them it's a temporary mind-state that there is there in right now and so if you don't like what they are the best thing you can do is love like that you know you got the mean dog how do you change a mean dog by beating the meat dog and discipline in the meeting. I know you love me and talk to him and then all the sudden I love manifest from that mean dog so if you really hate
I love them and then he did that as well as he really learned about them in a so like he put in the time he put in the effort he really couldn't end any could speak to them you know and you just found a way to relate I'm not I'm not suggesting that all the world's problems can be solved just by being friendly but what I am saying is that his thing was real you know Ed and this idea like we're reading about church K2 who you know he was he was cursed in a way that you could say was unfair and hostile and extreme
 and he responded to it in the in a way that you know if you took a thousand people how many would have responded to it like he did maybe zero it out but he just said I'm going to respond in a way that's
 it's not like he was intensely doing it in a way that was very different than anyone else but he was doing it the way that his heart was motivated the way that his mind understood things where most people would have
doubt he came forward with just a completely detached and compassionate response and not only did it kind of did it in his own life to the Manifest in a glorious way in his next birth as Richard Surah but it actually changed the mind of door goes with Kirsten like on-the-spot she was just like well she stepped back and she reconsidered the whole thing that you just didn't let you know what a really deep and sincere way so what does that say about how we were you know how we can respond to where we see I'm not trying to categorize Dorcas thing is like Injustice or somebody that but but when we see Injustice when we see hatred when we see bigotry it didn't it's do we really want to see what we're doing it does have more to do with our self and how we feel about herself or how we want to be perceived or does it have to redo it actually trying to change.
let's just keep respond in the same way just like pumping out statements on her social media and if you know it has it been taking it for a little while and then come back out on the good morning everybody I I I just really appreciate that that person you know that is under something special I love it I love the fact that
 you know some people just don't get off the exit there at hate these guys evil organization I'll hate them and he just decided I won't hate them they are not going to hate them doesn't change anything all you need is love so you ready to get into it with them. Leave them saraswathi India song

 read it for the srimad bhagavatam it's a new chapter every buddy
Canto 6 chapter 18
 text one and it's the chapters entitled DT vows to kill King Indra
 yep mother of the Demons even demons have a mom chapter or just going to summarize
 okay so what sense the we we've kind of we practically come to the end of this Canto right and then again there I won't go into depth in a their three big stories and the three big stories that never illustrating that the superiority you could say you could say it's a superiority people aren't going to like that word we could say is maybe trigger trigger is a little bit but like we can say how
devotion is more evolved than mixed emotion and the idea being is that we commonly feel ourselves to be good people so when we hear descriptions about devotion in these taxes in yet it's me and what the Bible time is doing in each of these cases the same actually really have to look into yourself pure devotion of a very high goal. And it in order to gather you can have to root out all of them mixed motives that you have until there's nothing left but pure love and so that was Illustrated in in the u.s.a. three conflicts a conflict between the the Yama dudas and the vision to do this a long time ago then there's a conflict between Russia and Narda and then the third conflict was between Ginger and virtuous order and then and now we've heard more beverages or we can just pass life we understand me now
I understand how he became who he is and now there's just a couple chapters left again we see Andrew put in anxiety. But it kind of depends I'll be honest I would really like to I was looking, tears and I wasn't able to dig up very much but it ends with part of what's being done is what's happens occasion the Bob, this is where sometimes we kind of skipped over the bit cuz this is a long chapter that's describing this person had three sons and two daughters and this one gave birth in this direction and that will give birth to him to keep going down but didn't what it what it does is it kind of it kind of gives us a preview of cording to be hearing about later in the Bog with time and so you'll go be a list of you don't like a whole family tree coming down you'll hear a list that includes like 60 names and like eight of those names going to become really important figures later in the bar with time so we hear about the two sisters DT and Aditi and the
that did the family trees coming down from each one DTS we've mentioned already she's sheet from hers coming a dynasty of a saurus or those that are opposed to traditional and her sister idt's giving birth to the Dave us who are you are you know they they work on behalf of Vishnu maintaining Universal order holiday parties must be tough with those guys you do get in the box but we will hear about like the sores and the in the in the day of us having to work together like in the eighth can't do when they have to turn the ocean milk which is one of the most fascinating passages in the Bible and it will if we should hit that sometime the second half of next year
 are this year now but in any case
chapter device to kill King Andrea we hear about how big is going to take birth in a regular one of the most important changes with this you know in one sense if you are some historian and you were to discover this book it's like I was interesting Tale But this tale has been commented on by great Masters for thousands of years and now we're trying our best to, now and I'm using their, Terrace but it's one of these things it's there's so much more in this story than the story and that's what's that's was beautiful that's why it's taking years to finish this book sure because the whole thing is almost like written in code they have all these fantastic stories and and they're all meant to be like thought upon repeatedly is it it's like with any and this is the king of all great books it's the grand tourage
but any good stories like he treated me every Moby Dick you know you read in oh yeah it's a different thing from it when you get something like this
 thre is just like went through this again and again there's so much to pull out of here is it it if you would read it like a story which people want they want something abbreviated give give me the essence David give me the cliff notes give me the it's like what's that app that reads you the abbreviated book at I can't remember but anyway this is you can't do that you don't want that you want this longer you want to stretch it like taffy and pull as much out of it as you can and even we've been in four years and we're not halfway through stretch far more than one story to go on for a month
okay so some of the people that we hear about being born in in a coming down from ADT the mother into the patriarch I guess it's hard. Page matriarch matriarch of the Davis we hear about the sage bhrigu who's born of Verona we are about valmiki who's also the son of varuna we hear about Augusta and vashishta are two sons of Verona and mythra and then the TT has 12 sons one of them is Indra
 and who's the who's the 11th son and then by his own powers Christian appears in that dynasty as Mama to Dave and so we're going to hear a lot about if I'm going to Dave and we're nearly out about intro going forward and I got you into she Stand By Me key and bring it with these are all important names to the pop up here and there and then we hear interesting you do from from DT somewhere
big names that are going to be especially one of them is going to be playing out in the next Canto but we hear you know her her initial Sons were to run your coochie poo in hiranyaksha we've heard about here on yakshe in the third Canta we're going to hear about here on your Kashi poo in the next can Torres like you know the most aggressive you know most aggressive a saurus power source and from his wife, he gives birth to a lot sokoladas born in the family the demons but he's the greatest of the box of Yogi strategies like so special and so then the whole next Kansas Lord has a lot so much to do it's a story of Lourdes Trinity Christian appearing is the lion-man line but really
 distributed has he just says like not that many verses in the course of seven or eight chapters is really about prod it's really about the devotee of issue that we that we learned
so was your about Pearl odd
 we hear about you did you know that prolonged head is not a lot had a sister named Seneca
 and she bore a son by the name raffle and so we're here by Rahul and the okay and be sure you're getting Rocha and his grandson was known as
 Bali massage and spa Bali becomes important character that we're going to read about Bali had a hundred sons and one of them is bona Bona Surah he also come up in the 10th cancer after describing the dynasty Of The Addictive and the other demigods sugar day with Sequim goswami describes DT Sons known as the my roots that's
second half of this chapter and how they became elevated to the positions of demigods they were born in the demon womb but they all became day was sent. Let me just read the summary that paint a wall of my house at the family tree of the volume a time go for you know just feel like you're mad at me is the fact that they even list them incredible well this is this is how proper summarizes the rest of this part he says that after describing the dynasty of the ditches and the other demigods sugar to go Swami describes DT Sons known as the my roots and how they were elevated to the positions of demigods just to help in Lord Vishnu killed her in action in reign Akashi Pooh
 he already did that as as some
 I did it as as nurturing Dave
and it's called bore right as the Divine for Incarnation okay, because of his DD was very envious and she was eager to have a son who could kill intra the injury was the cause of the death of my sons so buy her service she Enchanted cut you out the Muni Opera is a husband to both DT Energy and she just served him and Charmed him and satisfied him so much that he was like tell me how you know what I'm going to reciprocate yeah he kind of promised so buy her service she Enchanted cuss you out but in order to back from him a greater son to do this in corroboration of the beta conjunction with bunk some epic RCT touch up and when he was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to Grant any request what however she requested a son who would kill Indra
 he condemned himself and he advised his wife DT to follow the
so this is what he does he's not going to break his work at this age as they don't do that kind of thing right they take their word every seriously he's given my word there's no question of yeah he just wants a little a little but then what he did was he said okay
 in order to do this you need to perform a particular ritual and this ritual is something that would get her mind absorbed in a particular way okay so he says
 he advises ydt to follow the vaishnava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself at you know I guess what these last two chapters are illustrating is that even if your devotion is mixed if you if you apply yourself in the right way and accident lotion that you become purified still right that is not that's that's not the the aim is that the ultimate aim to have Mick to to approach God for the things of this world
but if you begin to speak of God's think of God as he is serve God then you become free of those though our desires eventually that's kind of what place I'm in debt to chapter so she's got that check I got this desire I wanted a son that could kill Indra he gives her rituals that are like Bucky related rituals they get her meditating on Lord Vishnu and serving Lord Vishnu and she becomes purified of her lower desire so he advises her to follow this advice of a ritualistic ceremonies to purifiers help when DT following the instructions of push-up an engagement emotional service injury could understand their purpose she's out to get me she wants to have a son that can kill me
 and as usual he's in deep anxiety he starts to do all kind of things because he's afraid he's going to lose his position
 I'm one day injured had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service so the idea was
is a very elaborate ritual that goes on for like a year and if you make one little mistake then rather than have a son that would kill interest she would have a son that becomes a friend of intra song was like right there he became her servant in Disguise is waiting waiting for lunch one day she like didn't wash your hands before she went to sleep or something like that and that gave him the ability to kind of like with his own Mystic power enter into her womb metal Shrek and and he gets in there. I was summarized okay one day and you had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotion of service does he entered her womb and cut her son 249 parts
 in this way the 49 kinds of are known as the my roots appeared but because so they kind of head injury what are you doing to us and he they all kind of became friends because she
broke the ritual it soon so she gives birth to 49 Sons
 let me just continue this I think this is where the word marut comes from I think it means something like I'm crying or something of your that's are we talkin about to my roots yesterday to her and I talked about Among The Roots I am reaching there you go but because he had performed the violation of a ritualistic ceremonies all the sons became bison of us and not only that but when she saw that she had 49 she kind of woke up and she said she had 49 sons and they're all there and their friends with India she became please with Indra okay and so the whole thing it's kind of like you had a really bad motive but you engaged in Acts of bhakti
 and you're able to let it all go where you you became purified through it I think that's kind of us being will straighten this to the next chapter which will read now has to do with the death of the question
will be what was the ceremonial what were these rituals have shoes that I'm interested in hearing about those what what prayers did it involve and so on and so now we read that in in the Final Chapter this can't do you know what you could say that I'm sure you know some people who engage in Acts of baki with material notice sure and make a fly-by there's probably seen people like that hoping to myself some but you have people you know if sometimes I can tell my kids okay you learn Dutch Lopez and I'll give you a reward or yeah we're done with our you be able to do that with kids or you do it with
 I don't know who else would do it for maybe it maybe you can watch get some money but eventually they can purify just by being associated with it and we saw that's what happened with dhruva back in the 40 okay so this is probably going to say at the beginning of chapter 19 this chapter explains how.
a simple Muniz wife executed Kusha Kusha pulmones instructions on devotional service and it describes this this particular Val that you took and it said that this Val destroys cruelty in the heart and it pleases me to know you're not even if your entire motive isn't pure it purifies your heart and it's in a position to win hear about that. Chapter 19

 you gon doesn't matter just keep going there you going to hit next Hutch

 text one
 brass crickets in my dear Lord you have already spoken about the seven of the how now want to hear about it in detail
or I understand that by observing this valve one can please the Supreme Lord Vishnu
 superliga swamy said on the first day of the bright fortnight
 gas break from thinking about that right now that's it for the fortnite Brite for an it with the full moon I get to ice supposed to ride with me and as it's getting brighter and brighter than the waxing yeah supposed to the waning moon the bright Fortnight of the month of August hyena November December following the instructions of her husband a woman should begin this regular devotional service of the Penance for can fulfill all of one's desires before beginning the worship of Lord Vishnu the woman should hear the story of how the Marines were born under the instruction last chapter under the instructions of a qualified Brahman in the morning she should wash your teeth
 wash your teeth
read toothbrush bathed and dressed herself with white claw and ornaments and before taking breakfast she should worship Lord Vishnu and Lakshmi so now we're here the prayers with which to worship fishing locksmith in this is part of the idea you know we say that the office is literature is divided into three different parts right to the car Makanda, conda anaconda and you can say bhakti condo Pasa anaconda and as you evolve higher and then you look back at the other ones in see they're not so important right like the motive behind them is not so important but this kind of shows how can work she's got a materialistic motive for doing this ritual but it's going to get her meditating and thinking of Lord Vishnu and Lakshmi
 as a devotee and so is his educational and it's have it for me you know
so now we're going to hear the prayers that she says to me as part of this ritual to Vishnu and then to locksmith. So this is text for she should then pray to the Lord as follows my dear Lord you are.
