I may go to try those
 seems like everybody accepts it that's like Barefoot isn't it interesting it's like it had us the accepted voltage slippers are Barefoot maybe it's because you only maybe you only use those for the hurricane that you don't use them for any other purpose may be like that and there is Barefoot the idea is the dust of bra just be touching your feet I don't know how if my Robert Converse can't work maybe after the way you could not be touching the Destin Bridge

 your body recovery group meetings today at 9:30 a.m. eastern time and 7 p.m. will you be good to do the show at 6 a.m. eastern time tomorrow
earlier than our regular time that's what I was figuring my time correct
 all right
 here's the kisser all right let's do this I have a question that I know you can shed some light on some Sammy klemmer she's friend slash student from Boston known her for many years has been in Indy with me many times it's all Sandy I might a question that I know you can shed some light on the concept of little stars. Is strong in Indian culture
 and I understand it goes back at least to the Mahabharat if not even much earlier I would like to hear your general thoughts of blue shark. And I've always been a little confused about how, fits into bhakti and the bug of agita, Kama how should I understand
who is Sharda and specifically, within the context of bhakti when there is such a cyst on relinquishing desires or, or we, inbox you be defined by connecting in the Supreme connected to the Supreme Krishna I'm ever grateful to both of you and the community and if it's too I am grateful to you and the community as well to do y'all sitting here grateful for you
 sure I'm so push Arta that means poop purushartha is combination of two words it's Peru refers to like human kind of it I mean purusha means person push art Antarctica need something of value so push Artemis like any objects of human Pursuit and as societies
you know this goes way back in Indian culture goes way back in the text definitely it's their Mahabharata she mentions in them
 I don't know if my heart is a first-place would put them all together like that in and and expanded on it at length but certainly the four separate ones sure they found I think Dharma Arta in, or spoken about a lodge in The Vedas
 and maybe Moksha you know which combined with them I don't know if my heart is earlier the earliest place to find that or not but yes it's a very strong they're very prevalent construct within the Hinduism and they don't then the ancient teachings of these ancient texts so Dharma means let's let's first, just give the gist and you know what there's a billion people a billion commentators a building so there's always someone that's going to Twisted a little
but in general the idea is that Dharma means the discharge of your duties as their outlined in The Vedic texts so you know if you are a business person you have certain duties as a businessperson certain responsibilities so you need to be charitable to take care of the elders to do this to that whatever may be your duty is clear and you discharge that Tootsie as a you can call it a religious kind of observation you know like this is how I practice you know I'm responsible and dutiful in these different ways are to means Department of wealth and so the ideas if you are dharmik
 if you are virtuous
 then at least the cultivation of Good Karma and you become blessed with the good things in life and and those you know in this pies context those jelly beans like a wonderful spouse
you know wealth the birth of healthy loving children you know things like that you know you got blessed with these good results acquire wealth
 and when in that situation then Ashley, is there that the gratification of your desires the love of the family you know a nice home you know whatever brother you know good food but whatever may be your desires become fulfilled the gratification of desires,
 and then comes Moksha which means one lets go of it all and becomes free of their material entanglements their that their Consciousness is able to let go of all these attachments you can become free from your suffering in life and free from your entanglement in this world than you can even transcend this world so that's that's motion and so the idea is that there was kind of this is a progression that someone could go through in your life is hard
to renounce it all
 you know any Chief Moksha
 people will say that unless you kind of gone through it and been in the end disappointed with, right like in the end saying you know what okay I enjoy these things but there's more sure I enjoy these things but whatever pleasure I get from the fulfilment of my desire it also brought anxiety and pain and there seems to be no way to get one without the other I need to let go of it all as soon as one gets older as one you don't Joyce household life and enjoys the love of children the love of spouse xcetera but then also goes through all the anxiety in the pain and the difficulties with that as one gets into their later years they start to let go of it all in that by the time they die they let go of everything in the Chivas
 so I Sandy's
I had to do with willing bhakti how is that seem particularly like who you choose to brought up, because, means you know what it means materialistic desire is there another concept of, and boxing is our concept of purushartha within body and it's a great question and you know it kind of the question allows us to highlight exactly what she cheat on you taught like if you go to the church on your charts and Rita which is a book that is similar to all the teachings from this lineage through a biography of Sri chaitanya featuring several about six or seven very important conversations he had with different very important people this term push our two will come up it'll come up in his talks with prakashananda sarswati in the 7th chapter the ideal Ela who is like he was this big important
 a monist philosopher sanyasi who is who is
the leader of like hundreds and hundreds maybe even thousands of sin yahtzees in Varanasi right so the in-person list the kind of the school of it away to vedanta there's a conversation will shoot any mention of Sharda with him and there's also his teachings I believe to send out and goswami he also discusses his and in different terms of use I thought I would share these terms in one he says punch him a pool shirt there a Krishna Prima town which means there's a physical punch, who shot that right is not just for this a fifth an ultimate goal which is a Krishna Primadonna which is The Treasure of love for Krishna
 it also speaks of the part of a poodle sharta are the poodle shark tostada the supreme goal of life for the ultimate goal so what should you tell me was teaching what srimad bhagwat time teaches when we talk about what your tiny teachers
 he's he's he's speaking to these in Port
people particularly when he's speaking to the goswami is like a group and Sonata and he's instructing them on how to fine-tune their understanding of all the way down to in the way that he teaches to do that is you go to the Sherman bar gluten which is a commentary on vedant.
 Given by the author himself showed up yesterday then he's going to stay there you going to find it's abundantly clear that the ultimate the part of my pool shark.
 Is Prema is divine love it's not Moksha it's Prima and and sew in body of a we focus on Prema on that as more important than any of the other four
 if the other four are going to be engaged they're going to be engaged as Servants of achieving Divine love like I may be dharmic on a path
 and I'm being dumb and out of love for Krista you know but it is like that and in this is
Sandy said is there another way to think of, which means the desire the Fulfillment of desire and we give that up exactly it's just it it has to be in relation to Krishna has been Savin Dorma at the end of the bag of each of her should I give up all of the religious Star Mall give up all of the those whether it be rituals or observances that are part of some religious
 practice and Just Surrender unto me with love that's the praying for the shark that you know that at the high school so when you get to Sherman by the time you see all these ancient texts are speaking to different people on different levels so for some of the frame isn't even in their wheelhouse you know like even thinking about her aspiring for it
to get them to practice Dharma hey if you're dharmic you're going to get well and your desires will be fulfilled and when you get older you can let go of it and let you know that was pretty good yeah yeah yeah but for those that have the
 you know I message you have been listen to some of the young
 recordings of erotic Roman I was too after you told me I listen to the application to the shoe mud bog of a time very nice daughter you really mentioned
 look at where the srimad bhagwat time starts
 it's the person that is being spoken to right at the very beginning is Mirage Cricket who was a king who had everything at all this power but he was incredibly deep devotee of Krishna and
 he had no much like in others
 when he heard that he was going to die
this is what he said first he said if you go to the Devi piranha
 is it is it mentions that there I think he said it was a priest and the king or something like that and they had lost all of their wealth
 and they were in anxiety because of that
 and then one Sage speak to them and speak to them about letting go of everything like renounce it all think of think of think more in terms of Moksha think more in terms of letting go of all this stuff so it was a sage speaking to people that were on a lower level of Consciousness people that when they lost wealth they were in total anxiety and sufferings I was losing everything he was not only losing his kingdom and his family and his power his Prestige as well he was he was he was cursed to die in 7 days and he knew it but he was not lamenting at all he was a very elevated stage of consciousness
 the point being is that the Bob
is giving the highest truth it's Ritz is for when you're ready to hear it all he was ready to hear it all
 and so the so there were going to find very clearly that Prima is the very gold of Life Divine love for Krishna unmotivated uninterrupted is delivers admin super City the complete satisfaction South so that's our praying through shark that's that's what we're looking for somebody that's that's our goal that's our and that's what we're all about an educated consumer or a very very fine devotee student is ready to hear Mirage pressure was that you're not going to get half the message it seems to take you one step forward and bottle of time it's if they're giving you the they're taking you right to that fix them
 I don't know if I have much to add to what you said but that is
current that The Vedas
 encourages towards Dharma Arthur, Moshe because it's the natural current of life you don't have to renounce everything in this material world as you get older the material worlds take it all away from you you know what I mean so your idea of getting a job and being you know following ethics in this world and filling your desires happening on Material World anyway and there is a path of that but there's ways to refine it how you there's ways to refine your Dharma and then you see the world is okay I'm on this conveyor belt moving upwards and that is all for Sonata and armies people within the beta culture
 a lot of times we have to get off of sinful desires and we have to stabilize herself instead of you know running to try to fulfill our material desires that don't fulfill us so he said well there's a conveyor belt here you'll get some of those desires it's all going to work out and boxy it always has the curveball
and all basic teachings like surrender all your soccer but I've been working so hard for something higher and you'll hear that because it would have does it it puts those four in perspective of actually what you really want in this world and when we all really want is pure love of God and that's why is confidential knowledge it it's not for the masses is for those who are real deep sea creatures and it's above all beta customs and that's why we're a little shocked when they're sort of like a Yung simmie I see when like someone renounces the world at a young age as we think they haven't gone through the whole thing it's so that they're really ready to let everything go yeah it's not you find that it works but it's it's rare because there's so many designers had woven into our DNA like like good devotees say what I want to take some nasty and it takes me off
don't give up the world I want I want to become a month for life and what happens is these deepwoken desires like I just want to pair it I just want someone to love me I just want to those are all real desires and they're not illicit desires within a certain time frame work and sometimes they dragged that renuncia it right off their path only two okay I'm going to have children okay I'm going to go get married but what happens is we realize I don't have my children we realize that even my my life partner my soulmate I might have to lose them they might die they make it sick I might try and sell the material world is designed to cut away everything that we think is solid in this world so if you try to jump over it you're going to get those lessons anyway and I could drag you off the entire path so body is set up in such a gradual healthy way you'll get all those desires only to realize those desires won't give you what you really want and the Box epap
set the bar at the as the as love of God to be the highest it's like the last rung on the ladder that were actually reaching for and all those other the Porsche artist they're all meant to get us there they're not make when I supposed to end their okay I did it I've got my own desires fulfilled and now I feel free from them and I want Lobby service to location but one can achieve that physical without going through all those in other words you can live at home and never renounce it and actually that's going to lead to the next question I think it's because the whole point is the love right and if you develop that love
 then it takes care of her what the other four men to take care of I can redo quickly run out of this body Lila this is these are two verses spoken by shoot your tummy to precaution on the star Squad to the the leader of the United Way that they don't answer in barnosky he said religious religiosity Economic Development since craft
Haitian liberation of known as the four goals of life up before love of God Head the 5th and high school these appear as insignificant as straw in the street for devotee who is actually develop a bond developed this proud of this love the pleasure derived from Dharma Arthur, and Moshe appear like a drop in the presence of the sea ride if you really want true happiness its founder Divine love and then maybe just a little purported it proper to write some interesting stuff maybe they could wrap it up in the Holy Name Of The Lord one should not desire
 the material advancements represented by religious Economic Development sense gratification ultimate Liberation for the material world
 as stated by she tell me more about the highest perfection in life is develop one's love for Krishna and there's another term he uses their Prima promart on Mahan Street you tell him a hyperbole
atami dumb this is what he taught that the Primo is the highest goal when we compare love of God with religiosity economic development says gratification Liberation we can understand that these achievements may be desirable objectives for the Blue Book shoes are shoes or those who desire to enjoy this material world and moo moo shoes those who desire Liberation from it but they are very insignificant in the eyes of a pure devotee who has developed Baba the preliminary stage of love of God Head Dharma Arthur, and Moksha are the four principles of religion that pertain to the material world therefore in the beginning of Schumann Baba time it is declared the arrma prajita height of okra
 cheating religious systems in terms of these for material principles are completely discarded from schmidbauer time for sure bottle time teaches
only how to develop one's dormant love God so so is his cheating religion that's the term is the second verse of shernan Bob Thomas is in this in this piranha we're not going to take you through these other things are going to promise you material enjoyment or even the enjoyment of relief from Eternal suffering we're not interested in that were interested in pure love you and when it says cheating is kind of like the cheating is your being offered a promise that this is going to make you happy but in the end it's not going to make you happy and the only thing that's going to truly deliver that deepest deep happens that every soul is Desiring is divine love and that's fucked you like that I'm at the store to tie into the next question to Frederick from Sweden via Discord Discord still going strong have a hole on like I've been in a long time they got a whole world
I'm 44 years old and a and a beginner on this path of bhakti and I have a question on one hand I hear / read that you should keep living your life chant and read and hear from scriptures and perform your duties work etc but do it in Devotion to Krishna
 that this will be sufficient for a person to become pure and be liberated in this life then on the other hand it speaks a lot about only super pure devotees can be liberated and I interpret / understand this as being the monks I'm not saying that I feel like I'm wasting time and energy doing this but at the same time I can sometimes feel like what's the point when I'm probably not going to be a monk anyway if it's true that one can be liberated in this life even though you live in normal household your life then that could probably drive me to try
harder and go deeper into Krishna Consciousness thank you good question oh yeah I think it's safe to say no householders who are very very involved people know. The only issue with being a householder the only issue is there's many issues there's any issues to deal with and household your life the first one being your house like okay I got a house if anyone has a house they do their house has issues you got to paint the house I got a few of the house going to keep a house free from draft what you have a household there's a lot of issues a hold on that house that household life and keep the main thing the main thing that's what we encourage on the podcast and then all those issues of the household my son's sick my son missed his flight my my my my spouse is a got anger
choose your my spouse has had an affair what was so many things come up in the material world by it's my partner's birthday that apparently can distract you from the path a lot of those things can get you more focused on the path and you put them you learn to put them all in perspective to a household or 10 they just have to be little bit expert at what I call the zip line of material existence you know the zip lines are they like a balancing beam a slackline is like a slackline we don't want to fall off it's a very delicate walking pattern
 of balance it's a householder has to balance all the minutiae of mundane stuff with their core identity as pure spiritual self and you can do that sometimes people will say well it's easier just to give it all up give up the house
look up the kids give up the spouse I'm going to live in isolation and we see people do that to the problem with that is we were saying earlier it's sort of woven into our DNA very often to want that
 temporary cushion a temporary romance a temporary soft home Etc we need their scent to be a desire for a softness in our material existence a warm and so what we try to do is we adopt certain type of austerities within even the house whole life and sometimes people just have a strong calling so you know what I did it and now it's over and nae nae and they go through it and then it and then they walk away from it at the same time you don't have to give up household and spouse to become a liberated Soul especially if your household and spouse is supportive of you becoming a liberated saw that it makes me even more
beautiful and more and more easy to do you know if you're working together to serve Krishna and Guru I think oh what a perfect couple they've taken syneos this is they're sending us there if they renounce the desire for sense gratification they just have here is my mission for you Krishna and it's a very attractive thing you know and so no is the Purity can be there in both situations and both can be distractions everything has its distractions you no one gets a pass on distractions
 thank you and take away son take that away you and I know you're beautiful
 Frederick I think it would be safe to say that
the biggest misconception regarding spiritual I particularly when it comes to the Eastern pads
 is that
 did the goal is achieved through renunciation necessarily that is that it's all about renunciation in particular when it comes to pocket it's not about may play a role
 but it's not the go the goal is actually devotion you do full dedication of one's heart and soul to God through that one lets go of everything in this world in that love the intensity that love Jen generates ones momentum through it you know you just mentioned that you mention to people getting married that that's their senior right that's their renunciation of that may also step me almost sound like the completely self contradictory statement and heresies some people can take that some Hindus
take that as heresy but saw the body to get a Caesar open up the Bhagavad Gita
 6 chapter 1st text inositol, Pelham cardium caramel Coolatta and a rug near the chakra that our philosophy he was a man that had all kind of worldly duties he was married yet children he had social responsibility and when he was up against it
 in life he thought maybe I should be a senior see maybe he said I think would be better for me to live as a beggar right then took two then to take up this social responsibility have a defending you know in this war and Krishnan at no point in the bug we get to the most important book you know of spiritual philosophy
at no point did he instruct Arjuna yes that's what you should do you should be, you should externally renounce as a matter of fact you off in the same exact opposite like in this verse were in very powerful language he says one who is unattached to the fruits of their work
 and yet works as they're obligated right they're taking on all of their worldly responsibilities
 is in the renowned storter of life that that person in the world that uses is sinuosity and Yogi it says he's the true sanyasi he is the true yoga that you missed it and then he flips and then he gets even make it is strong so let's let's let's do this whole thing he says if you work as you're obligated to work if your father and your your good father if your mother and your good mother if you're good spouse if you have a certain business and you do it in at the colon virtuous way you know
if your teacher and you're teaching a very virtuous way if your politician in your politician in a virtuous way you know whatever it is your responsibility in this work if you do them in a virtuous weight without being attached to the fruits you're not doing it for a selfish motive you doing it to serve God and to serve others if you do that he said you are seniority because you pronounce the selfish desire you're the true Mystic because you're actually purifying your Consciousness through this and then he says not he who likes no fire and performs on duty which is what the seniority is bright lights no fire means like
 there's rituals that involve lighting fires for all of the worldly things that one does in the Hindu culture right if you would get a new house just like you light a fire there was a marriage that you you helped officiate yesterday Runners right so we let it we let it fire fire you do his part of the drug struggled a little bit
fire finally got up there need more camper and you know if you get a new home you light a fire you know if there's a birth of a child you light a fire so one that lights no fire means the what is walked away from family life and worldly responsibilities performing no duties Krista saying that person is not a real renuncia at the one who works in this world is so it's kind of the opposite of the impression that Frederick has gotten that that you could get that impression from Reading to punish shots say right but but the thing is Buck is not dependent on renunciation it's only dependent on on devotion itself and so fragile saying you know he's heard that it requires the super to become super pure
 to become free and that in one sense that's true but super pure means I want nothing else it's it's an intense focus and under strata focus is it's not a half-hearted it's got to be full hearted
but it doesn't mean leaving home and becoming a monk it means with with a full heart that it's a simple as this particular in this day and age
 respect every living entity
 enchant these these names of God without any sense of false Prestige if you can do that intensely just that it doesn't matter if you're living at home or if you're living in the forest it doesn't matter if you have a family to care for or if you're wandering mendicant but that Dad is the that's where the intensity is needed and that can be cultivated and in a family life and it could be cultivated as a monk I know people that it had are doing it incredibly with a great intensity and great Purity as married people
 both men and women and I also know people that are monks that are doing the same thing and so I'm Frederick I love where you're coming from your comfort you know I love your desire and you met at the end
that time you said if it's true that one can be liberated in this life even though you have a quote-unquote normal household her life then that would probably drive me to try harder and go deeper in the Christian conscience will project go for it because that is the case that is the game
 nice nice my rights 10 57-52 here in Nashville
 we're going to do this this next one is such a good question I would love to see you want to go over time with him maybe you want to enter he's already here today there is many many duties here in Nashville to perform maybe we save this question maybe we jump ahead and lets you know what a faster question is it was Melanie Pope's kaszuba and Mara I hope this email finds you well I cannot wait to be back on the zoom with all of you soon once my schedule lines with yours again thank you
free service and for all that you give us what thank you truly your teaching and guidance has changed my life and the community would have called it is brought some of the dearest people into my life but that's wonderful to hear sweet I feel like I'm connected him blocked I feel like I'm connected in Buck across the world I feel like that to it is so beautiful wonderful so with that have a very simple question I was wondering if you have we got this question on occasion I was wondering if you have a good book recommendation which simply outlines Bucky in a way that is completely approachable for someone who knows nothing about the party wants to understand a little more and doesn't have a big desire to be invested in a larger book maybe something like a stupid about the 101 presentation thank you all so much for any guidance you can give
 you want to start brother
 a good book recommendation song to monk by rock and roll the way cap
find your own spiritual journey in his I will say mine is a good introduction even if people don't like punk music and I think the stories of people like my favorite is my favorite introduction is and I sound like a heretic for saying this but I'm not robbing us one of his journey home
 his books I find that as for a new person there's a lot of words and philosophy probably ready for everybody who's a lot of Indians a lot of and I feel I felt like in my own life I got more turn into Baki by hearing Americans cuz I'm American go through their American struggles and people telling me they're story of how they got at the BOK T matter fact I can honestly say I'm moving the temple before I read any problems books I just love the devotees and I believe the philosophy books before not like fully cover to cover is that pathetic or what whatever
that's my truth and then and then and then it resonated with him or so I left on this one because I think it's it's a story and I like stories and is peppered with the entire philosophy and you can hear from this person's this person's experience and it truthfully at my that's why I wrote my book to share my story as well so the journey home would be a good one and it's a great thing to give to people and people can see their journey in in in mirages Journey good 101 otherwise sometimes I say science of self-realization which is a Q&A by prabhupada book which I really like and I think it's a little bit easier to understand any of these books you know Bhagavad Gita studied by great Scholars and theologians and academics so sometimes if we're not if all were used to is YouTube shorts
it may not fit in with my mind to when I'm going to study spiritual philosophy the bug of agita as it is best for the prop hunt that is a very powerful book in a real game-changer as well
 sir
 yeah that's all should I agree I agree with you I think Punk monk is on the top of my list for books and also I agree right you know 101 presentation Basie that's the book that I'm putting together and I really hope that that will serve this purpose you have taken someone from you know you're not that body all the way up to cloak of Randolph and you know just step by step in a very clear and relatable way that's kind of what I'm trying to put together but
it doesn't quite exist yet although if you want the first half of that you could always get that on Vonnie as like not as a book but as a
 it's called wisdom of the sage is that the name that they gave to the course at a game on Bonnie so that's like 17 chapters you know on myself and one other book I thought of which is just a real semi sweet you know how they have travel books for you you open up in his two pages like you know Roman or if you know it or not even the wrong but if you like this facet of Rome like you know like it's got several different on those units to page layout as Godlike not only you know that
 the copy of the text that's explaining in-depth what this play
optical digital photographs and then it's got you don't like a sidebar with you know focusing more on one aspect of it so it's real introductory there's a book about body like that made very simple very Visual and that it in just broken down into different categories and that is called the hidden history of India by Steven Rosen that's a cool book so that's like if you really want someone that's just like you know just explain to me the simplest way that book could be helpful to
 no Mikey primble just put in the board he said you know that interview I did on Joe Rogan you know a lot of people they might not give credit to Vedic teachings but they'll give credit to Joe Rogan as like some authority to somebody you want to hear about Vatican information check out this clip or the the YouTube episode or the Spotify episode that I wasn't Joe Rogan because we talked with me it's conversational
it is personal and it's peppered with our philosophy as well peppered they're going to be like oh sure whatever is this it ain't no but they expect that they look up to they may look up to Joe Rogan is like okay he's talking about it he seems interested in this and said depends on who you are or who you're trying to explain this to ya
