 and loving it okay so we are here today and I'm experiencing transmit the blessed I did I did a program in Alachua last night with fruit like teenagers like 18 to 25 year olds and play like
 I don't know my life to them but a lot of them live very sheltered lives so put in a gas can go to the
Lower East Side might might my ten-year-old son asked for questions you have to go and then a few questions and a few other ones and I just basically told stories from those questions have to do with magic tricks know they were like philosophical questions he was asking but it was great having Rocco and my daughter saw she was a nice family reunions in all of their friends and sweet Community here and then we went to the Ichetucknee River which is like this Crystal Clear 8 ft deep winding spring-fed river flowing through the going to the Jungle have you done that yet for once in my life I know what you would love where I could have been worse over that 25 years ago although I will say I wasn't expecting this and you know how we always joke when I'm in India I was like snake I always say things like snake free people out and I've even brought a rubber snake to India
or such fun pranks a big black rubber snake I purchased on Amazon before I went to India just to freak people out but I saw it I was like handling down and I was first me and Mary first and my little ten-year-old was second and then there's like 10 and five other tubes behind us
 and I just went right by this log that had an alligator sitting there with his mouth open and Jagged teeth like you know the first thing you do when you wrestle that thing on that I told you yesterday I know you told me yesterday old the mouth shut her mouth shut and I was like okay well I had a tiny little like the child size paddle in my hand I was like this is it I'm going to have to protect my children with this little plastic panel I'd like bring it on and my son is like first of all no one believe me I'm like the boy who cried wolf I was like
yeah right Dad we're sick of your pranks
 I was a gift back on your boat on your on your raft no one would believe me and then of course I'm thinking like that alligator is looking right at tarun my son like a tater tots like that delicious little tater tot and loading down the water
 but you know if you've never hung out with alligators that just I think they eat once every two weeks and I don't think this was on the day cuz they just like they're just completely still as if there was a open one of my at them because they're basically incredibly still just laying in the Sun what do they eat they eat children they are you kidding it's not like the regular basis
 I don't know I mean it depends on how do you know that you just told me
eating patterns but you can't even tell me what they eat what depends where they are they I've seen one it's not it's it's like sort of like not eating and it's not like the best meal to eat I like in the Shell it's like eating so I'm one of those fruits have too many pits that the fruit has never become popular in this country as I get in the nut that's still in the Shell yeah that's exactly what it is raw fish snakes Turtles small mammals birds but I did see a big one Chase of sheep
 and they're fast you know so it's like I want to paddle away from that alligator to get to the center but I was I who am I kidding I know they can't they can't swim but the land is all marshy anyways that was a great and we saw lots of turtles some massive herrings and cranes
it was like being in the Land of the Lost it was actually very nice by the way that we came home to the program super-sweet today's walk on Wednesday special walk on gas do you have any nail salon there first

five or ten minutes about their life what they're dealing with and what they're doing is interesting please welcome, purselley highball,
 thanks for having me, is one of my oldest friends maybe my oldest friend Parma Nando's 23 year old son and he grew up and it's about a family nice mom and dad was born in Temple and I was living in Boston at the time I was walking around showing off my son I was living in California when he's bored I missed the birth but I have pictures of him and my kids when they were little pups and now he's all grown up how are you doing Cota
 getting ready to move down to Pennsylvania yeah you were just in India how was your trip to India is amazing
and I kind of
 thought I had a better idea of what to expect after last year and it just completely blew my mind again so you did something which is incredibly important to advance and spiritual life and that is win the hearts of the bridge bosses which is the bridge boxes of the people that live in the Holy Dom the holy Villages and and endear yourself to them and you did that because you're a tattooist and you started tattooing all the satos you want to share something about that yeah sure so I just kind of brought my stuff because last year I saw some people tattooing on the street there and I just wanted to try it so I didn't really know what to expect or how it was going to go and then one day when we were walking back over downhill I saw this sodden with
tattoos on his face he had a bunch of tattoos already so I just went up to him and asked if he wanted one even really speak English so I had to do a kind of liked and little charade with Assad is eventually he got it so I set up my stuff and immediately before I even started with that too I had a whole crowd of people around a really I was just like you too man be lating covert on hill and they were just kind of stopping to check out sleep there and bag and everything was a lot of those people Alright by John Gotti probably yeah
 so so that's why I was wondering like how the word got out amongst the bridge boss he's like how did they spread the word out tattoo kid from America here but it seems like I guess one guy saw you but then they started a list or something I'm waiting list
but even that organized it was just every free-for-all everybody coming up asking me for once what kind of tattoos did they want
 yeah and how did they explain it or did you were just like I'm going to give you whatever I want and how did that work for that I had like a little flashy of just like devotional kind of tattooed Sheila that kind of stuff they did not want that at all they want like American tattoos
 side is well and so how many tattoos did you end up doing dealing with over there I mean you're only in go over town for a few days I did for for tattoos nice nice I saw one of the last I saw the guy because I saw a photo of you tattooing what's your Instagram account called again my Instagram is less kidnapped,
Hannah is the name not Connor Connor k a n a young Krishna and so let's kidnap, is his Instagram account and now he's moving to Holly is that at Hawley Pennsylvania near Harrisburg and he's going to do a star tattoo in there and just wanted to support people in our community doing what they do want to devotional tattoo let's kidnap Cana you can DM him on his Instagram account to see his work there but I think it was a great idea that stupid don't you
 serve the bridge bosses and how do you serve them well in the old days you might want to give them Maha Suites in the old days but now they want like a sleeve Times They Are A-Changin but the principle is the same you please you please the devotees and Krishna gives you blessings and I can tell you got the blessings, because
you're inspired in bacta and that's that that's a that's a great thing I think people need a little inspiration in their life with the speak of spiritual inspiration comes to Humble to mention this sure the devotees loved him the bridge policies loved him so much that whenever we would walk around all the little kids would be like let's kidnap Ghana Let's Get Enough Kana Kana was serving the satos and giving them tattoos
 so he didn't get himself to the Guilford on bosses which was nice sound like she really made a splash in the local community there is Honda have a whole community of that loves you and you know what I mean you might could be a guru or a
who had citizen or something
 I see you in the message board Connor not kind of Connor one of our regular listeners put up a gopal tattoo that you did for him the name Connor came from cuz you're living in Southie Boston at the time and you wanted a name like like it sounds like Connor like head in the Boston accent, it is very short of Irish Irish Boston name
 Econo Econo Leroy like they're always Charming names of little Little Krishna is a bridge boss your name so they must love saying it to the locals will thanks for good luck for your dentures & More Than more than more than that I'm just happy to see the second generation of devotees inspired and bhakti and you and your father he's also very sincere and dedicated to voting and has done so much for so many people
that tradition is passing on to you and in that Spirit of giving, we're very impressed and we wish you well and if you're interested in one of these devotional tattoos check out let's kidnap Cana and and and then you cannot post your picture on our message board thank you, thank you guys so much I'm all highball keep up the good work come on everybody's doing it Linda Linda Linda tattoo your neck I think she needs a neck piece cuz you showing off some risks that's not a tattoo if that's it come on Linda you need neck neck is nothing now the old days neck was something now it's no big deal

people back home again at the Midland Michigan and I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open in my eyes with the torch for the knowledge I offer obeisance he's at the Lotus feet reading from the stream about it but I'm kind of seven chapter 8 chapter 7 chapter 17 x 17
 who's speaking brother who speak a lot is speaking to your dad is he speaking to he's speaking to his the children of the Demons at his boarding school for like a mayor I when she was a kid preaching Tyler friend yeah it's a private school boarding school private school teaching the all the young girls at Emma Willard
 did you try to Enlighten them era on transcendental topics now just slightly different story
so we just have one of the great mahajan's hear one of the great all-time teachers of Dharma all-time teachers have bhakti yeah that would be one of the Great Indoors of truth but it's just a little five year old boy yeah but buddy you got this true some how many invited it so much and his friends are asking where did you learn all this stuff because none of our teachers teach this that is kind of the opposite and I he said I learned it in the womb actually I was on my mother went when you know my father who is this super Tyrant he kind of left home for a while just to build up his strength of his arse through austerity to build up his power they left my mother alone and all the the enemy's my father didn't the Dave has had to buy you injure came in the kidnapped my mother knowing that she was going to give birth to me right they're going after the kid did they when they were afraid that the other than the spawn of
Turner Classic Movies is son would be a another next Tyron in line
 and so they were going to be kidnapped her and they're like just let us an artisan know you can do something similar to the story of Yoda baby Yoda was yesterday or in the Bible but didn't they try to teach capture baby Yoda they have I do I baby it and he's any Star Wars people that put that in the board and its bit too old for the kidnapped the mother of pearl add the wife of a run to catch tapu Narda who's you know he's on you know he is the same age but he's he's such a size that he's actually appreciated on both sides both by the hour and the Azores the demons
 he said you can't take her like that this is wrong and those and they're like no she's going to give birth to this unit to this next tyrant in line and he said actually you don't understand all actually heated she she
great devotee of Lord Vishnu you have no idea and I like oh really okay. To honor him and moved on and she stayed while her and Akasha Pooh was off doing his austerity she stayed in the auction with Nardo nardis spoke
 Dino did they do bhakti Gana you know transcendental knowledge knowledge of bhakti to Charlotte and her but he mentions that she forgot it all but I remembered it all and so that's her picking up now vide interesting is text 17
 this text 17 is kind of like a a Prelude
 2
 to the rest of this chapter which is encapsulation of nardis teachings to provide and it's really
let's get started in this home. She has continued my dear friends if you can place your faith in my words simply by that Faith you can also understand Transit until knowledge just like me although you are small children similarly a woman can also understand transcendental knowledge and know what is spirit and what is matter cuz yesterday they're making the distinguish between it women that he was saying that my mother didn't remember all of this I remembered it all but he's saying there's no there is no external disqualification
 when it comes to bhakti you're you're all children you're thinking what can we learn no no no X everything was distinct to your Cass was distinct your nowadays we're all sort of big blind and big blind a big bunch of mutts everything was like
your birth and who your family lineage was and your families that can't marry that family that's marrying down and you'll hear that all over Hinduism in that does Hinduism in all ancient cultures you'll you'll hear this Eno you marry someone of your what's the word they used
 of your cast well if that's what the Indians use but Mara come on your good private school what do they say of you or however stature and so but invite snobbism it's really not supposed to be like that actually because we understand all those things yet there's distinction there are definitely classes of people that are much smarter than me they're definitely you know you going to like Europe or me when I go to Europe it's like you pull into in a Holland forget it ever was giant evenly urinals on the wall I use this
what is it what is going on here so there's like me they weren't your nose
 that's a water fountain steel there's cultures and there's just with all those are secondary of course obviously because everyone's everyone's a spiritualist even take it's outside the human differences right they're smart and they're strong and there's no tall and slender in this blond and there's brunettes and there's
 we'll take it outside the human species every living entity even a reptilian cruel looking alligators actually Spirit Petersburg saw they just have a different Bob
 and in this case hey here is a little boy blue
burned in a bloodline of demons
 and he happens to be a devoted and has become a devotee from hearing this is the whole this is the key and he qualifies that hearing a bit here too
 is his simply by the face he says he said if you can place your face in my words
 simply by that face you can also understand transcendental knowledge just like me although your small children right so he's there's there's this song he sang here's the qualifications that has nothing to do with gender has nothing to do with a jeep has nothing to do with what family born it is this is merit-based anyone that comes for that's able to open their mind right now remind open their hearts set aside all of our skepticism and give it a fair chance hear it out you know
you can understand this and you know there's some kind of homes in on this in the commentary mrs. these words of prolonged Mirage are very important in regard to knowledge descending by the discipline succession even one prolonged Mirage was a baby within the womb of his mother he became fully convinced of the existence of the supreme power because of hearing the powerful instructions of Naruto and understood how do I tame a faction in life by puppy yoga these are the most important understandings and spiritual knowledge and then he quotes 3 verses that speak to like these are famous verses these are versus it from three different sources
 that are kind of devotees, the committee's to memory these are pretty
 popular ones
 420 quotes is from the Treetops rotaru punished shot yesterday VapoRub of deer
 you know that.
play terracotta yarta precaution table how many of those great Souls who have implicit faith
 boast in the Lord and in the guru all the importance of a technology automatically revealed
 Echoes of the one this one probably realizes he is quoted as being from but you're asking me to send you but I think even there it's citing the original source which is Padma purana SRI Krishna Nama di Abu Dai Abu Kegley Mavis parotida no one can understand Christian as he is by the blunt material senses these instruments
 do not pick up and Pat you notes that vibration right you can't you can't take a record player and it's in here to hear the radio through it and seems a lot more blunt that's a great
 yeah you can't see you can't pick up
division of the form of Krishna music with these regular eyes or would you and every day we were hearing from the Maha Johnson hearing from the Bible every day and that's how we change the translation that one is no one can understand Christian as he is by the blonde materials scientist but he reveals himself to those devotees being pleased with them for the transcendental loving service unto him so it has everything to do with the attitude and finally he quotes from the bug of agita bakhtiar mom originality and I'm trying one can understand the Supreme person as he is
 only by devotional service and you know whether that's in that means not by through Guiana
a pasilla pasta to knowledge not to austerity not through ritual you know or do all these different other made a Core Yoga processes but only through bhakti only two devotion and when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion or could enter into the kingdom of God so probably conclude these are Vedic instructions one must have full faith in the words of the spiritual master and similar faith in the Supreme personality got it then the real knowledge of op and part of me, and the distinction between matter and spirit will be automatically revealed this automatic or spiritual knowledge will be revealed within the core of a devotees heart
 because of his having taken shelter the Lotus feet of a mahajana a great person such as prolonged Mirage
 you know this is again this is one of those things like what is this sectarian the ID
it is that if you really want to understand any being
 the best way to do it and there's a lot of ways to understand people I can I can look in the mirror I can notice her I could take notes and what she's doing I can go through her writings journals trying to pick the thing with a few people that do not put passwords on her phones like an open book you learn to love that person and when you learn to love that person they start to share everything with you is share their Joys our hopes their Inspirations your sadness their fears or anxiety and the same as with you could do that with an animal right if you really want to get to the bottom of why is this dog Shore by Steven angry at you listen to love a dog. I'm single.
in the dog starts to like reveal his heart you'll start to understand a dog better than other and then build himself to you yes and then you do that with humans as well for some that you love a child when they feel like they're safe they start to reveal themselves to you Krishna is the same way God is the same way the absolute truth is the same way you know the absolute truth by the mercy of absolute truth because you're in love with the absolute truth and then all of a sudden the absolute truth Lord Krishna starts to reveal his heart to you and you understand krishna's heart you understand how to serve him and then he starts to leave you out of the quicksand of the material world
 it's it's real and you can see it happen in this world so love it is bhakti love thing is not just or like we're saying that cuz worried about the team and you guys are they get on a team but it's it's considered the highest way because love is the highest it's it's an evolution
give me all's I know is valid and it's real but you going to help you evolve still higher to love going through marra's text messages is also way to know Mara but if she's not she may not reveal the highest thing to me personally she might share it to some people on her cell phone but you have the bestest through actually loving the crew sharing it with Gus haven't got a chance to be like a very intimate and various members of your family now from from here on out for the rest of the chapter these are the teaching this is like a little bug of agita that were going to get it right here in the right it's like we're going to get like a
 a nice thorough presentation of bhakti unless he begins to text 18 and it goes to text 85 it'll be before he starts reading this I just want to take us to it mention this word for allowed was a great Maharaja
this is your Sanskrit glossary goody for the day should I learn this word a Maha Jenna right of the John as a person just needs a person has a great what are the great person sits also there's a list of the the great mahajan's a lot is one of them the great personalities so you'll hear that word
 okay now I just want to point out that little Corona 10 years old his pointed out Rugrats is important stuff that's her stuff in his private as for her okay sorry lyrics I don't go through her stuff even though her phone is unlocked we have a trust trust that looks so let's just say I wanted to show some mystery this texting this is going to be the first first and then let's just do something a little and let's jump to the end and let's just see like where it starts and where
just as the fruits and flowers of a tree in due course of time undergo six changes Indians love a loss we love to put everything category the fruits and flowers at Regal 26 changes are you ready here and here is how they break it down birth existence growth transformation dwindling and then death O's are considered the six Transformations if you see those Transformations take place in any form then that's evidence that a soul is in there making that matter transformed through those patterns
 the material body which is obtained by the spirit so under different circumstances undergo similar changes however there are no such changes for the spirit Soul okay so that's this is the this is where prolonged begins his teachings to the students this is what he heard from Narda where does it begin if you want it if you want to explain why don't you know
does the basic existential questions in life what is life what is its purpose what are we doing here who am I you know what is God you know what is this world it starts right here by speaking of the distinction between the cell for the soul and the body you know let's let's first try to understand that we're not the body that's where all knowledge kind of begins now where does knowledge and like where does the if you follow this thread where we going to end up and now we find in the last first was just text me to five
 you want to read it or should I just hit it you can read the scroll at 5 you going to be crazy yeah I'm here in this material world to render service to the Lotus feet of Govinda the cause of all causes and you see him everywhere is the only goal of life was the only goal of life to render service to the load of speed of Govinda and to see him everywhere right is not it
if it's kind of like you know what I worship this God but everybody else in this world I got no appreciation no respect and work of the lotus feet of Govinda SRI Krishna but you also see him everywhere and in what that means we will get more into when we get there but that's that's the thread that we're going to follow begins with them not this body and ends with seeing a serving God everywhere okay so then so then let's let's go back to text 18 which you know again is the very beginning of this of the philosophy of life of of what life is all about it begins with distinction in to understand this distinction and analogies used
 about the the fruits in the flowers on a tree that you the tree stands there in the the fruits in the flowers that come come and go according to the changing of the seasons are profiled rights it's in the computer system the fruits and flowers of a tree seasonally come and go but the tree continues to stand okay so Sarah
the transmigration Soul accept various bodies which undergoes sticks transformations
 but the soul remains permanently the same soul is eternal and ever existing but the body's accepted by the solar changing so he's saying it's like in in in this analogy are the soul is like the tree it's it's kind of stays the same and the fruits and flowers They're coming and going on the tree cording to the patterns of the seasons
 and so similar you know we stay the same although we go through different bodies you know the soul Remains the Same and we're taking on the spot and then we're taking on that body and there's continually changing we need to understand that we are not that body that's that we are something different in this is the beginning of knowledge
 is the beginning of figuring out what am I doing here and who am I and what is the purpose of this sits at this kind of where you start but proud pie
you know this is where he
 he spends a lot of time with his Senate protected when he's in he was traveling around the world for those last 12 years of his life constantly on the Move, see meeting new people comes to being interviewed constantly speaking to new audiences he didn't jump to the very esoteric stuff
 she would keep people right here because this is what kind of cracks everything open this understanding I'm not the body the son of the need to because that's when you begin to kind of figure everything out and he would often say like this Krishna Consciousness is not a religion right this party is not a religion it's a science
 you say to science in for larger ones like what he told me I was at a science but let's let's look a little bit deeper into here there's this is propolis in the concert is going to make a statement about Consciousness and Consciousness is a very big question in science you know what is it what is it
how did how did Madara become conscious of itself yeah yeah right that's a big question of the elements on the periodic table okay how did matter become conscious of itself that's something they can't answer ya how does how does matter become conscious or where does Consciousness come from in improv pots time when he was riding this was fifty years ago okay half a century ago half a century going in in these this half-centuries like the speediest most like things are developing faster than ever before and it's heavy and one property was speaking the way he didn't let me read this from from the country since the foolish theory of modern chemist
 that life can be produced by chemical interactions cannot be accepted as truth so she'll probably says this based on his realization
fiction realization as it comes through these ancient texts he's saying that Consciousness is a symptom of spirit which is a completely different energy that has nothing to do with matter the two different energies and you can't put matter together in such a way where Consciousness develops now that's what the scientist fifty years ago were saying they're saying we're going to create life in the laboratory we're going to create a living cell we're going to create something that's alive and that's the Consciousness that has Consciousness that has awareness we're fifty years down the road they've struggled trying to do this for fifty years and they're beginning to realize that they're not going to be able to do it
 but they kind of like move the goalposts like it meaning the generally like moving the goalposts is like what like a
 in debate or an argument is like one of the fallacies right it's like someone says jelly with the with the
post has moved farther away like I wouldn't believe that unless it's been verified by this kind of sorts will it is verified by that kind of sorts here right and then you say well but I but it would also have to be this all okay you move the goalposts on me you know right so but here the what the scientists are doing today is the moving the goalposts closer like they said we're going to create life in the laboratory
 now they're saying that artificial intelligence or artificial Consciousness could a computer if sophisticated enough is conscious it's just it's just a mirror of a human does the humans are programming it looks like you're doing exactly Smita can human consciousness right like this is I pull this off of
 off of Wikipedia about artificial Consciousness you studying Wikipedia again oh yeah
artificial Consciousness also known as machine Consciousness MC or artificial Consciousness AC synthetic Consciousness or digital Consciousness DC they didn't put DC after that one but why not maybe she's already taken but is the Consciousness hypothesized to be possible in artificial intelligence it is also the corresponding field of study which draws insights from philosophy of mine philosophy of artificial intelligence cognitive science and Neuroscience some scholars believe that Consciousness is generated by the inter operation of various parts of the brain these mechanisms are labeled as neural correlates of Consciousness or NCC
 some further believe that by constructing a system like a computer system
that can emulate this nnc into operation
 I would result in a system that is conscious
 okay that's that's their claim that what is consciousness is just a brain working on a certain level of sophistication and if we can take a computer and bring it up to that level of sophistication then the computer is conscious and it's really such a complete Bluff
 we all know like Francis
 the human brain can calculate numbers we can add we can subtract we can divide and multiply and son and we can also do that artificially like the simplest way to do that artificially externally would be like an abacus or something like that right blue slide this little similar to the calculator but yeah there's a more sophisticated Abacus essentially
what is a calculator conscious will know I don't think anybody would actually believe that that a calculator feels has emotions has awareness knows what's going on has self-awareness yet it it feels love feels anything it doesn't feel anything but what if I forget my calculus has attracted to a stapler so so so at what point of sophistication
 does it actually become conscious since does it feel this to become aware there's no stage it doesn't matter how much faster you can make that calculator work or make a computer work that it actually feels but there's but this but what scientist are doing today so we're just kind of bluffing their way through because they do not want to admit
 that is a whole realm of reality that lies beyond the scope of their microscopes and telescope
and it has everything to do with the most important questions about life they don't want to hand that over they don't they're they want to say we're the ones that determine what life is all about and it falls within the scope of our our guard Laboratories
 and Baba Tom is saying this is entirely outside the scope of your Laboratories and all the most important questions about life can only be answered in this way
 and so now they move the goalposts closer you know how can we can we can create life we can't create a living cell has a fisticated computer its conscience is not conscious so it's so we probably he was really pushing that button a lot you know 50 years ago and the the landscape is kind of slightly changed and how they're presenting it but they're still kind of presenting another block just a bit of a different Bluff in the commentaries
his body is the external feature of the Soul by the body is the external feature of the Soul there's nobody without the soul to soul is is to fulfill a purpose of this the soul that the body is formed and so since the body is an external feature of the soul the soul is not dependent on the body rather the body is dependent on the soul
 one who understands this truth
 should not drink should not be very much anxious about the maintenance of the body there's no possibility of maintaining the body permanently are eternally
 I'm Devonte you made a ha ha. This is a statement of bug of agita 218 the material body is under by perishable the soul within the body is eternal Lord Vishnu and individual Souls core part and parcel of him are both eternal

 text 2019 and 1920 refers to the Supreme lord of the living entities both of them are spiritual free from birth now is the supreme law or the living entities refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities both of them are spiritual free from birth and death free from deterioration and free from Material contamination their individual they aren't the knowers of the external body and they are the foundation or shelter of everything
 they're free for material change they are self
illuminated they are the cause of all causes and they are all pervading
 they have nothing to do with the material body and there isn't that interesting everything that we think we are we have to go to do with it nothing to do but if this place is right everything I've based my life on is wrong Rebel Usha there it is it is exactly that's our take away for today if this will have to do is write everything I believe it's been wrong I mean when we really get this we must feel like we're not of this world you know when you this really stinks and I understand the high school today because Swami they're like these other dudes are like walking around this world naked just wandering I can understand that makes sense but yeah they're like buddy is it a try when I'm dancing
but you know I'm going to be taking off a shirt it it's like that like we said in the past and maybe maybe tomorrow to talk about this way in the past or talked about how there's that dumb that that Arts that you know how far do you have to stare into it in the certain way that pops into a 3D and sometimes you know there's that episode of Seinfeld were like Elaine was looking into it and then her boss was trying to look into it and and I'm really trying to tell him like he can't see it that the image hasn't come out yet and you know some people seem like you got to look like you're looking right through it you know and it's a mess as I say no you have to look at it like you know like right at 2 so you know it's like you trying to adjust your vision so that you can see what's there that you haven't been able to see before and that's kind of what happens with this kind of knowledge transformation it like perladas in a sentencing look keep looking at reality you're looking at your body you're looking at everything around you and your stinking you are that body and you can be happy
by connecting your body with the things that are round it people looking looked at hear this and try to see it and try to see the six Transformations birth growth excetera excetera ultimately death try to see that how that comes and goes and we remain the same you know try to see it also need to have to try to feel it and you keep staring until it comes out and that's call self-realization when you kind of really like you're standing here then he want to just wander around naked at 4 Dead ends you know what I mean when you can see how this culture is getting more and more caught up in these dead ends things like a peer will give it I just have to take thousands of pictures of my face to see my face from different angles and I see all these other beautiful faces and what is what this whole thing with social media has its immense you more to the concept that you are a face that you are these abs your bicep sore legs or hair or eyes
yeah and it ties you Tighter and Tighter to the illusion right we even had this feeling I feel like I feel like I'm a Man I Feel Like a Woman call lucian's to you're not stuck trying to convince yourself you're a man or a woman or if your other gender they're all fabrication it's just a moment as a spiritual being and those other ones will just be like refuses an LG Esther day blowing on a boil to boil her tooth growing in my arm but when I blow on it it feels good it's not going away that's not making a boil go away that's just giving a kiss a little relieved I'm feeling this way you know what what you're feeling here's where the bottom says you are trying to feel like a spiritual being make that your identity try not to impress anybody with your body trying to impress any but what you were thinking about how to impress people or even try to feel grounded
something that's not me we are opting in for illusion
