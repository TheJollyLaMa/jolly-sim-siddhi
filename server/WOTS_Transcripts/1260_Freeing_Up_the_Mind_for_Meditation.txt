 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from gilbertown Hill this is wisdom to say Jezebel yoga podcast with your host Rockin off and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York because stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome to go over downhill we made it we made it and we are in the incredible loving flow of mercy of Gary Raj you see the Day lyrics by Rihanna
anyway me and Mariah have been fully absorbed 24/7 it's been great we had a great day today at we've been going to different Bridge bossi's house is a bridge bossiest person who grew up here so there's some families that feed devotees and just to be with these incredibly Krishna conscious family were with yesterday for Generations in that household children parents grandparents and say where the children like us they just took this to the roof where you have this beautiful incredible darshan Agoura Don Hill of their house and the old man is 80 years old who's been walking around go over. I think you just retired from walking
is that the story is walking around every day for 50 years I was his occupation
 I like walk around go get a permanent job and you retired or something nice and now the sun doesn't he's 22 and first thing in the morning we have direction of your garage and then in the direction of giving if you have to say what what are who Gary Rodger covered on his cuz some of our listeners sacred Hill
 and the sacred Hill is Krishna manifest as a hill in the story of Christmas Past Times Krishna lifts this hill up over his head when in your pores rain down on the village of her David and everyone hides underneath this hill so it's a sacred Hill it's like 21 km long it's not very high but they say
used to be part of the Himalayas and it somehow landed here and it because of a curse it's shrinking so now it's not very high but it's it's it's very lovely and brahmins and saintly people live along over downhill as long as there's been recorded history and I'm into famous place for Krishna devotees when you're there what do you feel these does it feel special to you and if so in what way
 I'm going to answer that question what do you think there
 yeah I feel like go over. He'll just has like a the energy of it is spiritually surcharge dad say you know when the people you met you meet along the way or just like extraordinary results
 yeah this family was extraordinary and then today we were with no hump on this family and that's a bit one side of radical and we had lunch yesterday
 and then we
have you been to Indy with me no more hump on that he's the priest that Roddick undo does all the the pooches ironical an erotica and Sean McClelland are the top of go over downhill and they're like to have to explain explain the inverted pyramid and is filled with water as he climbed on the Sands sandstones steps into the sacred Lake they say it's like liquid Rod ha and liquid Krishna and they considered very high place in the universe is like a second so she ate it with Radha and Krishna personally
 it's also a very very magical place it's a very potent place to go and pray and that's what I did today you know what I did cuz to tell me anyone that I ever felt hurt by work normally you'd have like resentment for the people.
 But then I've been reading this the stories of little
 I didn't this past time traveler Tik Tok
and Lord of inanna is chant the Holy Name
 hey what's that sound
 Step Up step up and organized
 you're getting all garbled so I think we may have to ask people to turn off their cameras
 Oh yeah you got to turn off this cameras today sorry people
 turn off the cameras hopefully we get a stronger connection this way everyone please shut down your camera
 where y'all in Paris are you can we need you to shut down your camera thank you guy
 I have to attend Murphy when you do to shut down the camera
sure you got there she go are you still here I'm going to
 I know we lost frog enough
 here I am again everyone all alone hopefully he'll be back in a minute okay anyway was nice to hear about rubbing eyes and his amaris
 pilgrimage to to the very sacred Queens of radical neck hammock on in to go over downhill
 have I want to save the Nugget for organized
 so I'm hoping you can come in quick
 but
 otherwise I'm not sure what to do so let's see
 and I think I don't really have anything else to hear this good nugget and this is from Jane Goodall who's a beautiful woman whose horse people know her for the work that she's done
animals particularly in Africa
 here are going to start to get into the Nugget but I hadn't started yet so
 you ready are you talking about you're talking about being in the home is that my take away from studying the life of l'arte Tonia with Mara was you stop taking up and stop being offended on a regular basis and can really ruin your life harboring resentment towards people and instead seeing greatness and everybody in appreciating people and then just check in the Holy Name it really sort of like takes off any barrier of chanting the holy name in it in it in a in a way and so that's hard because sometimes people have her
gas refill people betray us or people let us down or people have actually gone out of their way to you don't be cruel to us so we just went to rodican today and I prayed for everybody that I felt like trade me hurt me like personally would have you know we keep a list of these things sometimes in the back of my mind but it was a beautiful practice and just say you know I'm just going to let things roll off and I'm going to go to these people and just appreciate them in my mind and it was very very liberating and I felt like it was special last day of Lord she turned so could you tell us who are these people that have gone out of the way to hurt you just name a few names first and foremost the one day it'll be a little bit
you know how I'm a I'm a person that can get on people's nerves so you know what I had a nugget. Today's not today's nugget but I had another kind of some that I was holding on for a future Day Nugget
 but I could read it to you right now because it relates to what you're saying it because you're saying that we get caught up feeling we get caught up in the motions and we get very distracted our mind is very absorbed and distracted and feelings of resentment and being mistreated and so on and if if you let it go the Mind becomes free and open to be able to be absorbed in chanting and therefore like you're saying should you kind of said just chance but if your chat and you're engaged and it in your minds full of these really
demanding emotions of resentment that it's hard to have the mind of a sword when your chance and then when you meditate
 so this is why someone called I forget who she is maybe some of you know Corrie ten boom that's her name Corrie Ten Boom I think she's a writer maybe knobless or some of that anyway you want to check that out Corey c o r i e n t e n Boom Beach
 set me an eager
 yeah that's why she was a clock made or she had an Ashley she's fascinating person Euless public speaker who worked with her father and her sister and other family members to help many Jewish
 the Nazis during the Holocaust
 by hiding them in her home they were caught and she was arrested and sent to concentration camp
biography that recounts the store family's efforts on it and shared hoping God will she was imprisoned at the Concentration Camp still alive still alive she got out. She got out but she made it out of the Concentration Camp yes it was simple by just liked it is a child you have to learn to see things in the right proportions learn to see great things Great and Small Things small
 and really that's what it's all about you know it's just like that that these resentments that we bear in our mind are they seem to us to be so big and they're so big that they can they can dominate our mind and our emotions even our blood pressure and you know like physically they can you know you know ulcers and high blood pressure
based on Rosehill Ridge cancer even you know it's like it can it can really eat you up and we think these are big things and they're actually if we zoom out just have to come very very very small things I remembered you know there's that story I believe this story is found in a runoff Swami's
 the journey within
 and it talks about this one great devotee from South India and he asked his Guru what are the real qualities of a vaishnava univer real bout to Yogi remember that story
 brother are you listening to me
 do you even listen to me how hard do I have to call inquire from this other Yogi who lives you know are far away and had to walk there
took him a month to walk there through jungles you know that's the way the world was you know I have a question life I need to get it answered and you walk 4 month to go get it you know
 they finally arrived at the ashram of the sage
 and I you know he said you know my crew and in that stage knew his glorious you know I had a question for him and he sent me here
 to ask that question of you
 because he respects you so greatly and he said okay that's great but meanwhile and then he just started two engagements service you know their service to do around the ashram there people to feed there's you know so many things to do and you just got caught up in servicing days were going by and weeks for going by and months for going by
 and he he
 and I think when you first saw me said he sent me here with this question you know like you know what are the qualities of a of a Great Soul we know who are you leave Grape Vodka
question but meanwhile you know take care of this take care of that in any engagement doing all these different services
 and the divorcee that went there to ask a question he didn't complain you don't say well I've been walking for a month to get here
 and I asked my question you didn't answer the question and now you're making me like the golfer around this place you know it's like
 but now you know he had you had respect for the person in he saw the answer that he could receive as being something that he would Embrace and treasure for his life he was patient in order to get it and I think like one day after serving many people Prasad and if I remember correctly you know and he served everyone until there was no food left he didn't even get anything you know something like that
 and then that Sage tournament said you had a question again
 and he said yes
do you know what are the qualities of a great nation about what is great to Yogi and he said
 a great party Yogi is like a name for different animals write like a rooster
 crane
 something salt
 and you like you yeah I like you yeah and I said and then he just walked off like a rooster like a sound like a a crane like salt
 and like you like me like me
 well that's it continues to turn around and started walking back and and then when he finally ride back and I have to another month of walking back home you know his crew said what did you ask you a question do you get there did you eat him yes I met him you were there for quite some time
engagement services
 can you ask your question I did ask Mike what did you get rid of yes he gave it and what was the answer
 reset a great voice sounds like a rooster like a crane like salt and like me
 and is goes I call that is a good answer yes or no and then you know that he's got me please to interpret this scope ring to figure this out and so he said
 the rooster if I if I am hoping I'm remembering this correctly and if anyone on the the the chat board wants to correct me if they know this better than but I think they're the rooster psych you know the seeds you know animal you know the way nature works right is animals eat things that you eat food they eat fruits or vegetables and their season those vegetables
they grow specially well when they pass through the animal and they come out and they're sitting in the fertilizer already and so there's a lot of there's always lots of seeds in there and a rooster will go and find a nutritious seed even in the midst of that dung you know even in such a in such a
 unsavory Place it'll reach in and pull out something nourishing and valuable you know
 and so like that as we move through this world wise about to Yogi they can find some some valuable wisdom some valuable example some some valuable lesson even from people or in places that seemed totally human babies on the opposite nature so that was one thing
salt was like
 salt ism
 is like the salt in a dish makes everything in the dish taste nicer it it it it adds flavor that you don't know the recipe if you have a kid tree let's say you know when there's inside that catcher there's rice and there's doll and there's various let's say there's maybe spinach in there or some other vegetable or two
 all of those things have their own nice flavor and tell him I tasted and prays over the spinach and you're so delicious so you know any and the spices that go in there to whether it's human or mustard seeds where to put some macedo the taste of them just the way the mustard seeds are roasted you know it's absolutely delicious but nobody will ever say all of the salt in this dish is just absolutely fantastic I love it so much because of salt is in the background
you know it's very what it does is very you know it's a very important service roll their place are a little too much salt ruins it not enough salt our lives up to its potential but the salt gets in there and just the right amount and everything else tastes better but nobody it takes no credit
 and so great but to Yogi's like that they're serving good at the other and they're making everyone else shine
 but they're not taking any interest in any
 and I think when he said like you I don't remember that one sold so well but I think it has something to do with just a selfless attitude of service
 but the one I wanted to speak about in relation to what you were saying was the crane
 the crane and they say the crane yeah you know how I feel still stand like in a lick in a stream
 yeah and we still there very still they have your sometimes they stay
one leg in the water when they come up
 yeah they're looking they look they look down into the water and many many fish will go by
 and this is a criminal just sit there waiting watching small fish go by waiting and waiting and waiting and it's waiting for big fish to come it's not going to waste its time on a small fish it's focused it's not focusing on the small insignificant fish it's waiting patiently and ready to react when the big fish comes in when the big fish Comes the Boom
 it reaches down and place it right out and so like that we should not get caught up you know nowadays I say don't sweat the small stuff right we don't get caught we're like that crane with Focus we don't get caught up in the small Petty thing someone said a little something about me it just let it just go right down the street and I'm not focused on that at all because I'm Folk
what's important what's important as a box of Yogi when I open up the show me a box and I read it I want to absorb it fully when I sit down to do my meditation I want to I want to have my mind deeply absorbed with focus and hearing and pin and in being transformed by that Mantra you know don't be Petty with being petty yeah you'll just burn out all your energy and you'll never get the big fish and one time I was talking with with Rana Swami about this story is he is he and I were sitting in his room
 and we were talking about different challenges that we were going through
 and how we needed to not get caught up in Petty things and stay focused and you know I remember Maher are saying it at one point you just said like yeah you know that he stood that's a phrase that used if I remember correct
he said on
 link we have to stay focused on the paper and in the end he said the only big fish or out and Krishna in the end really you know just all that matters is our connection with that Divine Source cuz if we're focused on that will be will be rightly connected and deeply connected to all existence you know and so really the focus between really becomes Focus like that so I like what you're saying was like by your kind of like purging resentment by offering those prayers I think right and in freeing Yourself by wishing a person you might resent wishing them well success Good Fortune connection it sort of completely lips the whole thing Maya can't have the effect on you any longer and it clears your mind it clears your mom set up and is up the spacer
simple if you're simple but if you're very complicated then it becomes very complicated so what's more simple than to sing and dance and feast and glorify Krishna well there's a big problem if you have all these issues with other people on a regular basis you can't find peace within your own mind you Harbor resentment you find anger you hold on to it and constantly looking and you're you're in fear that people are trying to attack you you complicated your Consciousness and therefore the most simplest thing which is to sing a song to Krishna you can't do so it's a big party with a soft heart we become Tangled
 and so a big part of our practice is to untangle that mind and that's why you have the verses of want to be sure not a peaceful Nation
purses by Lorde shitani the important thing is how we should you know search out the greatness and other people and don't don't look for validation from everybody you're not going to get it anyway I could get it from anyway don't let that be your food let the service to other people be your food and all the sudden you be coming by the caliber of devotees were around and that's another important thing about coming a holy places you meet this High Caliber devotees who even make sense to us they don't even know us and they're like we are on the roof of this house and it's perfect weather out it's so Divine and I said I could pull it I could just live right on your roof and they're like you wanted to stay here but you don't have to sleep on the roof will have a room for you will take care of you this is your home I was like you don't even know us
Mohandas daughter kept on saying to me like Deedee do not say thank you to me you are you are a family this is your home stop saying thank you
 it's like we don't have this type of anise antenna incredible type of faith I said what was it like during covid could you go out and because your father go out and make money and oh no we had nothing we exhausted all our savings and then he was saying all we had was the blessings of Radha Rani we trust that Radha Rani mine I'm firmly believe I'm only a teenager but I firmly believe that without Radha Rani will protect you but people don't have that Faith any longer Radha Rani is there for you I will not engage in all the nonsense be people at school or engaging in
 just to hear the faith and the devotion and and all the house and all that rot around me this right around me that have that manifest
in the way she's treating us so beautiful and look at you we went to his house to see his alter his altar is you know this Radha and Krishna deity and then he's got maybe a hundred carved deities at least 100 of devotees that he worked a is some of them are bhaktisiddhanta bottom.or SRI the problem pod but then there's other living gurus both in and out of iskcon and he's got the 101 was like a little tiny dolls but carved you're like oh my God that looks best brahmananda they look like the expensive action figures and their own
play harmonium in summer holding a gun to a stick and it's laid out in this beautiful it's all decorated flowers and a giant go over. She loved it the size of my torso and he's just he just went into this soliloquies lecture to us have a look like a bunch of young boys unordinary extraordinary young boys and girls have come to serve his mission and to spread this Transit at the Holy Name these Lions amongst men come to get the Holy Name all over the world and it's just that he was so inspired and your there's something
 either either a new devotee has or a very evolve devotee has to remember when you just became a devotee and you just like wow you just appreciate everyone I met this guy this Sunday
he knew all about the Bhagavad Gita and I met this other person at the Sunday around 2 while you like oh I know this guy he's got problems do I know this guy I know he smokes marijuana I know this guy he I thought he was more advanced than he actually is there comes a familiar arity but there's something beautiful in that new vision where you're just appreciating people's good qualities or you're very evolve and then you just appreciate people on a regular basis and you overlooked their shortcomings so this person is a police permit very evolved standpoint he just had so much loving appreciation for devotees and never let anything else slip out of his mouth to the point where as he worships them everyday
 he worships them and there's something very Noble and
that's heartwarming to see that and people that just have wonderful things to say about other devotees
 inspire
 depreciation was so deep and heartfelt and it's like he was sharing it with us it was just like such a moving experience to be there I think when I go there I'll go there in a couple weeks and then it'll be like a little narrower there on the whole thing of David Charles Wilson

 yes
 okay you want to get started early. Text you at the greatest seem to be there should be some level of summary here and when you know two days have passed
 find it you wanted a bit is the great very important figure in shoes
Tom the little boy he's 5 years old she pretty odd the son of the the great Universal you know ruler and Demon out here on you cuz she proved he was asked by his father what did you learn in school today and he just gave this to Yogi insights about life these devotional insights you know you know when one gets too caught up in material enjoy minutes like I fell down a dark towel with dark deep dark well it's nothing but suffering want to just walk away from it all go out into the forest and meditate deep in their hard on Lord Krishna Lord Vishnu
 if it's somewhere in the world of this could get this turned to their teachers and said hey I need you guys to dig in and find out who's been teaching him to send them they they pulled me aside you know in school and they say where did you hear this to hear this from our enemies
you know from the day was the demigods is that where you got this stuff from from our enemies or Lots reaction was
 weather
 yep he was his reaction was
 do you know you guys are doing a friend than enemy thing oh my God cuz I feel like you can't relate to it at all. That's that's what you want to do all right he's sort of like him a little backhanded compliment you just sort of like a just like a honest way I don't think he was intentionally trying to insult them but he was very matter-of-fact about how that's a very low level of Consciousness said he just couldn't relate to like a five-year-old would do right like five year old will sometimes say boy you have really big ears like oh thanks
play something directly without one of your ears is lower than the other have you noticed that why is that answer then you know he spoke three or four three or four versus provided and they're very interesting and he mentioned how this idea of friends and enemies is that how it's a lower level of Thought He also mentioned that people that think that way they could never discover God within their own hard within the hearts of others I'm here to get some interesting things to share their and so now we're getting the response again from his teachers what text was Rihanna
 1515 this is Narda speaking the Great Soul prolonged Mirage became silent after saying this to his teachers Sunda and a marker the Seminoles son's a super Saria
a so-called braminus then became angry at him because they were Servants of run because you proved they were very sorry and to chastise prahlada Mirage they spoke as follows
 oh please bring me a stick this provide is damaging our name and fame intelligence has become like a cinder in the dynasty of the Demons
 now he needs to be treated by The Fourth Kind of political diplomacy are you familiar with that how do you know this
 yeah the first one is use your intellect to to defeat a person the second one is you flatter them you had kind words the third one is you bribe them and the fourth one is you beat them these are ways
according to a person's like mentality that's all they could you know that's how you I think these are all so just consider like this is just kind of like political
 advice of how you know like if we hear that way it might sound like all that's like on
 really barbaric thinking something like actually ideas that force is like the last thing on the list right for political rulers should be the last you know it is to be the last resort you know we should hopefully we can we can if someone is on problematic out of line creating you know rather than having to use Force the different ways that you can deal with that person
 and so a but they've had it with Elijah and the fourth one
 oh and you know property rights record was missing things in the country
cuz it is says
 because it's bad and oh no I'm sorry please keep reading
 it's this next person you text 617 this Rascal prologue has appeared like a Thorn Tree in a forest of Sandalwood to cut down Sandalwood trees and acts as needed and the wood of The Thorn Tree is very suitable for the handle of such an axe Lord Vishnu is the acts for cutting down the sandalwood for us of the family of demons and this provide is the handle for that ax so you may have a very sharp ax head
 and and that's a somewhat rare thing but in order to use you need a good piece of strong wood to taxes a handle
 and there's there's
like the demons there their they're Dynasty they're saying it's like a sandalwood Force rights and what is like
 amazing wood right it's rare and very expensive cuz it is rare and it's very fragrant as very cooling you know it has such nice qualities that the wood even you can just like put a little bit of water on a stone and rub a piece of Sandalwood in that water and you get a dis fragrant paste how the summer you put a little on your forehead your body close down as if you pull Roma
 even if you just have a little piece of Sandalwood furniture or just so you know something to put on the table at the Roma you know it's nice in the room it makes people only send so many things he's saying we're like the sandal Woodforest in this Pearl odd-even a lot as the one with the beautiful qualities hair he's just like a orange tree
you know it's only thing he's got going for this is like hard you know his heart seems to be hard towards us you know it's not his his his heart is not hard to them at all he doesn't see them as enemies even though he's able to speak
 directly to their to their faulty Vision he Bears no resentment towards them but they feel like it is resentment towards them you know and and they're saying he's like the this Thornwood that's assisting Vishnu as being take to create the acts they compared Lord Vishnu to the axe self the acts alone cannot cut a Thorn Tree needs a handle which may be made of the wood of a thorn tree that's The Thorn Tree
 of the Demonic civilization can be
the pieces by the acts of this new bhakti devotional service to the Lord Krishna
 some of the members of the demoniac Civilization by prolonged Mirage may become the handle for the axe to assist Lord Vishnu and I see entire force of demoniac civilization to be cut to pieces and I've is this is proper talking about his own Vision you know like him going to the Western world and you know the Sons and Daughters of you know of people in all kinds of positions that turn this world into the dark place that it is returning to him you're going to him learning about foxes learning these higher values and actually becoming part of the instrument of Lord Vishnu to counteract this crazy civilization that we live in Ypsi
Naruto here's to 18 Sunda anamarc are the teachers to provide Mirage chastise and threaten their disciple in various ways and begin teaching him about the paths of Dharma Arthur, Moksha or you know Dharma religion Economic Development and sense gratification this is the way they educated him this this report is important
 do you like to read it right now
 and then maybe you could quickly to speak to this Dharma are too, Moksha
 well in a material like they say in any of these are the sort of like the goals of existence you do some religious work right and you do some work in the world to make some money that that that leads to the next one which you eat at your desires fulfilled and then finally Moksha you become free from this world
 okay so dormant mean
that's good and I act religious and I do my duties are to means the result of that is I gain the Good Karma some wealth and then they, my desires can be filled I can have a beautiful home with a beautiful spouse in your beautiful children because I'm well to do now and I can enjoy life and then after you leave that for some time then you and you've kind of fun
 seen it for what it is and you can let it go and move towards Moksha or letting go of everything and becoming free up your material attachments
 yeah these are the paths of the material consciousness
 okay so you would like to read the concert and read a port police in this verse the words dumb dumb asses are important the words garage I am literally means
that they tried to induce prolonged Mirage to accept these Paths of Dharma Arta and, people are generally preoccupied with these three concerns without the interest in the path of Liberation most generally people are into the religious the religious Pious life the economic development in the sense of gratification and they never get around to letting go of every finger of Moksha we're lucky nowadays if they're even into the Dharma
 people are running cuz you put the father of pollock garage was simply interested in gold and sense enjoyment the word hernia means gold and Cassie Pugh refers to soft cushions and betting on which people enjoy sense gratification the word prolonged however refers to one who's always joyful in understanding Bremen
hot beans, or always joyful allowed was always joyful and worshiping the Lord but in accordance with the instructions of already cuz you poop the teachers were interested in teaching him about material things but your lipstick persons think that the path that religion is meant for improving their material conditions the material is close to the temple to worship many varieties of demigods just to receive some benediction to improve his material life he goes to a saado or a so-called Swami to take advantage of an easy method for achieving material opulence real good with salami and say
 and say ayo please give me your blessings right but they still working like want what's some good to hear about the so-called Sade's try to satisfy the senses of the materialist by showing them shortcuts to material opulence sometimes
give some Talisman or blessing sometimes they attract materialistic person by producing gold I thought some Mystic power then they declare themselves to be God and foolish materialist are attracted to them for economic development this is a whole thing and in Indiana state in America with these and other way preachers Southern preachers are like you God wants you to be wealthy God wants you to be a fun place to buy what do you live in their own for sitting there in my apart don't you know real if you were really connected guide you have abundance
 either weather
 I don't like it when our philosophies are so many stories of a very there's stories of very abundant Krishna conscious people and his people are destitute people are very Krishna conscious to ask for a result of this process of cheating others sheet
others are reluctant to accept religious process and instead they advise people in general to work for material advancement this is going on all over the world not only now but since time immemorial no one is interested in Moksha or Liberation there for principals Dharma Arthur, and Moksha please accept a religion to become at 8 p.m. sharp people except religion to become a popular and why should one be material opulent vacation that's people prefer these three marks or Paths of materialistic life no one is interested in Liberation in Baga Baga. Bhakti devotional service that Lord is even above liberation
 therefore the process of the social service or Krishna Consciousness is extremely difficult to understand this will be explained later by prolonged Maharaj the teachers Sunda and a Mark I tried to induce for laparoscopic
materialistic way of life but actually their attempt was a failure so you know what prop has writing about here is that there are teachings in the date is that the ideas that they will bring you through these different stages right that it's it it's a natural progression a Natural Evolution that should lead ultimately to Moksha or two you're letting go of your material Desires in these are like the four different goals now what should I tell you tell was even if you go through this and you do progressed through it and even if you get to Moksha you still haven't achieved the true goal of Life the true goal is something beyond that and they call that Prima promark the mountain is highest goal of human life is to re-establish myself in in the consciousness of Krishna Prema right in in pure love of God in through that
 Sherlock for every living being
and So within that realm of these particular the first three right down the archon, people have faith in the teachings of this in the in the ancient Vedic literature and be cuz it's like you're going
 it is it's like you're going into a shop that has all kinds of things and you could take out anything for free and you just go for something that's Petty and insignificant you know you're walking into a shop that has you know gold and diamonds and this and that and you just like pick up some little piece of plastic something you know something like that so that we we we approach The Vedic literature which can grab something that's beyond this world entirely something that's that's even Way Beyond Moksha that one can re-establish the doorman Divine love and feel the deepest ecstasies eternally and we want some
sing of this world and even were looking for Through The Vedic teachings and or trying to find it from asada and because we have this this type of faith in it all that when someone poses as a solid or prone to think o that person is going to be able to help me achieve these material list of goals that I want on and then we kind of reverential we worship them and and offer them our gifts and money and then they're tricking us and they're just living off the fame and the prestige in the money that they get so proper is pointing out to like just how corrupt it can all be calm and you know some people don't like to hear that they think I'll why criticize but now it's like you know you got to be careful in this world to try to find what truly valuable in and we we should know that particularly in this age
 even the people in the dress of Brahma knows or the dress of Saudis or the dress of priests or the dress of rabbi
did the dress of llamas
 an external dress doesn't mean anything you know and it's very common that their motives are in pure and they really can deliver us into anything truly valuable so we need to know what the goal is and we need to see what the qualities of our person who's moving towards that goal has achieved that goal and we need to focus on that you know what would you like we're talking about earlier what are the four qualities you know it's some of that has those kind of those kind of qualities I seek that out you know and and don't be satisfied with these lower heady mundane Worley goals
 you know we have to become like Jewelers if it if I was to go into a jewelry shop and said I want to buy a diamond
 if you don't know what a diamond actually
looks like they could sell you anything until this is a really good diamond and this has no cracks in it or there's a fugazi don't know but there is a way to develop the sermon to study gymology and to really understand this is what it means it had can have a crack or a fissure or a tent that's what makes it a good quality that's a good cut of a diamond so we have to become like that and that's what study in the back by Tim Thomas is creating discernment to tell what is bhakti and what is bogus know what is bull and what is bhakti and we need that in that sharpens our intelligence and sharpens our discernment and that's what we need as we are inviting speakers teachers educator is gurus in our life to see where they getting this from what are they teaching me where they getting it from are they making it up or they Charming are they thoughtful people are they are they getting it from a bona fide discipline succession
are they just like Charming people making up interesting stuff and imma try and charm by them so we were taught how to discern what is a diamond and what is what is a Bugatti
 Fool's Gold Fool's Gold Fool's Gold let's amazing that you do these takeaways I don't know what you been watching you I just think you're knitting the entire time
 don't let resentment go to absorb your mind and chanting and gratitude be large okay
 be like a rooster to pick out the valuable nourishment in the done
be like salt to enhance all the other flavors in the dish and take no credit salty salty rain who is patient and ready and focused on the big fish
 you like the crane
 don't burn out your energy on the petty
 that's right you like you give up your anger to untangle to mine
 give it up you be you
 so far kept the greatness was the last one you said Mara
 don't let validation from others but your food
 report
 become like
to discern the quality of the Baki diamonds if one of those things you look through
 I was just came in and you got it man
