like that its own unique blend of emotions isn't it I want to talk about today said you just released a book that I just had a chance to go through it so it's a beautiful book called the four questions a password in a piece by vexation pedasi before we even get into it why don't you just cuz you want to get this stuff up front where can people find this book
 it's on Amazon it's on Barnes & Noble it's a available there electronically so we have a website also called work questions for questions book.com also has links to more information and follow up some things like that well this is you know it's when you get this book immediately what you feel when you're holding hands is
 this book is is holding a
profound truth but it's not going to be difficult to understand it's like it's going to be really clear it's really simple clear Communications of very important ideas in life and. You know it's a short booklets god let's see a hundred and thirty-five Pages sometimes we need it like that just a nice you know clear packaging and really valuable practical to put in life you won't get lost it if you'll feel you'll find and I think you'll find each little section of it valuable share with us your inspiration for 4 bring out this book what your thoughts were what you wanted to communicate in general
 very generally I wanted to write because probably did my Guru had written extensively as everybody knows and he also encouraged all his disciples to write and I felt it it was important to follow in his footsteps
and my writing this book was also a result of much of the
 many of the programs that I do in Silicon Valley and elsewhere that are at corporates I go to places like Google and Salesforce and so forth and I take the message that I got from Bhagavad Gita by try to present it in such a way that its it resonates with the modern mindset and vocabulary and very specifically this book is what I consider to be spiritual technology I sense I come from the land of technology in Silicon Valley I wanted to present something like a modem that you can take with you and you can set up anywhere and connect to the spiritual Sky the spiritual energy and that's exactly what the Ancients talked about they had various kinds of Technology through which they could
to the higher regions and this book follows the main teaching of The Vedas which starts with a tato Brahma jignasa which is the first technology it recommends and the gateway to all spiritual experiences and Enlightenment which is
 the question now is the time to inquire
 yeah and in the beginning of the book I am modified that a little bit I said now is your time to inquire as this is a book for the reader at to realize that your spiritual enlightenment is in your hands and if your if you have the technology that you can use it anywhere at any time that's the idea I love the introduction and I find that dumb
 deep thinker
within like a quasi spiritual world of spiritual teachers and spiritual books are so-called Spirit In A lot of times
 I don't know if you know what I think was Nietzsche who said he had this I really like this song this is a statement of his but he said that they muddy the waters to make them seem deep sometimes in order to have to pose as as like deeply spiritual you just use your vague or something like that and then end and it always sounds very deep it's it's so deep I can understand it well that's just cuz it's so vague not really getting to the point I find deep spiritual thinkers they take profound ideas and and they simplify them and sometimes it make him so simple sometimes they're so simple it's like why didn't I realize realize that all along in your introduction what I really walked away with his
we almost feel like we're in a weak position if you're asking a question right it's like I'm lost I don't know what I'm doing you know it's it's it seems like the answer is the one that's it really in the driver's seat but you but the way you made out of is actually by asking questions of put you in the driver's seat that like we all have this ability sitting there to ask a question or a question of great consequence and that that's a tremendous power just lying dormant there if we don't use it at any moment we have the ability to engage it
 so true t'shuvah in fact according to read or additions who whoever is asking the questions in a conversation is leading the conversation often times I might think while I'm conversing that I have to tell tell tell those who even want to leave the conversation and a productive way we would know the science of asking questions we call it becoming a master asker
a n n u r Focus the reader on the particular potential of asking big questions right now I mean there's all kind of trivia questions we could we could we could use this ability to engage our are questioning on a trivial topics but you focus the read on big questions really the quality of our questions determines the quality of our life because the word question as we can discern by hearing the word has the word quest in it affect that's where it comes from never even the idea of a question yeah it's amazing the etymology of it takes us back to the search for the Holy Grail according to the history of the word question and it means question it it talks about in the OED Oxford English Dictionary about other word question comes from quest which means when you ask a question you say
turn on a journey you're going somewhere and The Vedas say if you ask what you're saying is the big question asked about something that's to it to us now intangible that's beyond the physical world and the Nevada say the? Is a kind of technology or I say in the book that the? Is the most powerful punctuation mark in any language and The Vedas are these ancient wisdom literature say use it to your benefit to discover the mysteries of yourself the mysteries of the source of yourself and what's beyond the universe as an example when I was a kid I used to my brother and I used to live in the backyard and on our backs and look at the Starry Sky at night and I'd ask what's beyond that a question
that's how I think maybe a lot of people
 assume
 that these really big questions that nobody knows the answer it's almost like not even worth asking
 yes away I addressed that in the book there's two sides of a of a coin with
 the two sides are called Blind Faith you may have somebody who says oh that's just blank face face something in insubstantial turn on provable and so forth and then people forget about the other side of the coin which is blind doubt if you doubt the possibilities like a child may look at the Horizon and say well that's the end of the Earth and then the father says no actually there is much more beyond that and then the sun may say no I don't believe it because I can't see it so blind faith and blind out our
equally unproductive so there's there is a way in which a person who wants to know the answers must be open to the fact that there may be something beyond my perceptual Horizon right now and be bold enough to ask the big questions I guess we get so disappointed with incomplete answers that were indoctrinated in the way that you mentioned that maybe there's no answers to anything but this is a very pessimistic View and human beings when they're turned on to the fact that they have the capability of asking bigger questions that go beyond just survival questions how am I going to eat out where am I going to sleep and so forth and can ask why do I exist that's a metaphysical question
 and it's very penetrating when we ask ourselves why we're doing things that's the first question in the book what's my purpose
we can go a week we can go a month we could go a year we can go a lifetime without ever asking why I'm here what's the purpose of my life and philosophers who take time to think about things Francis Socrates said the unexamined life isn't worth living so they're so much more beyond all of our senses and it's exciting to think that the answers could be forthcoming if I just sincerely ask in there and I point this out of the book in the right attitude if I asked the question everything's available I wanted to go there actually I'm going to ask him
 maybe as a Prelude to it this question
 you mentioned that there things that lie Beyond are the perception like the perception of our eyes princess things that we can't see but it seems like a big question seemed to lie that right otherwise they wouldn't still be
they would have already been answer for everyone
 and we do get a doctrinated I believe you know it it wouldn't we get people that that Society recognizes as being knowing more than the rest of us
 and they maybe have a feel like we talked a lot about this on the podcast like you may have a people in the field of science some of these popular scientist you know
 and they'll do the bring up these questions and no say nobody knows you know maybe someday we'll know through our perception but right now nobody knows it's kind of a it's kind of a
 an assumption on their part
 but this idea that it's a simple idea and it shouldn't be so hard for us to grasp it maybe or just just as you said it a child May learn from a parent that there's more Beyond the Horizon because the parents been there
American give the testimony to it and then here's another way to access information is very valid way to access information that may be by asking big questions you gave the example of Buddha to Buddha asking what is the cause of the misery in this world is a big question why why do suffer while we suffer no further questions like that but if if we're going to pursue questions he's really important lives that Socrates of saying it makes life worth living in a life without it it is really not you know we really haven't accessed its potential what will be important for the questioner is is it is it is it merely just the question itself or this morning I need to be invested in the question or the questioning the act of questioning that will open up the potential to receive rewarding answers
 let me first address what you said earlier about the idea
but nobody knows that's a logical fallacy if you say nobody knows then you must be all-knowing know that nobody knows and you say there's no God then there's nobody omniscient then your ignition cuz it how would you know that and that opens the door to the possibilities and when we are given permission to ask for ourselves and say we are complete in ourselves as long as we're open to hear the truth which is one of the definitions of sincerity and Asquith with a sincere heart open to the answer that's one of the questions it's the third question that I listed called witches that says that what is the lesson in life and love that so many things happen to us self-help 101 is it's not what happens to us as what we do about what happens but the technology as I keep calm
of the question means you can do something very active it's a process through which ones when something happens to us and we ask the question why did it happen that takes us
 a long way past being victims or things happen randomly I'm assuming there must be an intelligence behind it there must be some purpose for me in this lifetime if I'm asking what the lesson is
 it's an interesting assumption to work with right sometimes sometimes there is an element of Faith let me assume that this is some kind of meaning to this and then let's pursue that and if you start by saying will you can't prove that there's any meaning to it more than okay then you just stuck there is very practical also it's not even a metaphysical question we have a default mode least I do which is why why would such a thing happen to me I'm
I never did anything wrong or why not somebody else why me why do I why does this happen why was this visited upon me this such a misery but if I look at the universe as the cosmic Schoolhouse rather than a place where I'm going to be well-adjusted and comfortable and I'm always asking the question was the lesson then I'd become aligned to the purpose the universe which is to teach me something enter
 ever increasingly come into my holistic self which means that I know my part in the universe I know why I'm here and that's what the Bhagavad Gita talks about how the way of finding the truth as you were alluding to earlier what what is the mindset Krishna says in the bug of agita Ted video pretty potting up pretty precious need a Save-A-Lot in production to take down I'm yawning up stuff for darshana be open
and humble hungry and humble and don't assume that you know everything and there's a I'm not sure I really like I think I included in the book I heard it on the radio interview years ago or somebody who was corrected during the interview somebody said oh you can't say that whatever it was and he said okay I live to be corrected I pulled over my car and I wrote it in my notebook and I said I'm going to keep that and that's the spirit of bug of agita what is it what is the self-correcting path as to be open to the idea that there is a illogical purpose behind the universe the logos which means that everything has an intelligence behind it and there's a real journey me a purpose to it and we could have lined with that they're asking the question was still lesson behind it and it's a it's a great way to take to live but I think it you know another what's it like here in your eye
you're not a native New Yorker here but you get here and you see the Subways running right you go down to the platform you sit there for a few days to see all day ride seems they arrive on schedule you know seems like it's a lot of thought went into building this thing and it would seem logical that there must be a map there must be something to help me understand how to make the most of this this this song this facility right it would seem logical that me and this time I said there's no proof that there's any map to this and then you can just sit there and never access you know what's available to or you could say you could go in with the assumption that must be a math let me go and find it it'll have the answers for me I can ask a questions it'll give me answers
 yeah I'm beyond it I mean referral demonstrative pronoun it it points to something named earlier what is it the one of the main message is it foggy
is there's a benevolent personality behind everything everything's meant for our Improvement and to bring us to the highest put into our Highest Potential and just regarding the subway when I was in London a couple years ago I went to I was invited to somebody's house and the
 roommate of the person was upstairs doing his work which part of part of which was on his computer room working remotely he was helping to run the the London subway system
 he was he was a young person and I I peeked in the door and there he was on a computer screen and he was helping to run the subway and make sure it was running on the field that from home schedule so I know there's this guy sitting in a room and Harrow
apartment who's running your train for you and making sure that the switch opens in the right place and then I thought the way you're talkin about of the universe we don't know who's running the switches here we just know they're working properly if you're able to ask a question who's behind this and what's my part in it if you're able to ask that simple question that there is an answer its forthcoming and you can go that way and find the personality behind the universe and that makes all the difference doesn't it when we just lay out the four questions what are the big four questions that you're asking in the book or encouraging question number one what's my purpose
 question number two how may I be of service question number 3 what is the lesson and question number for where am I investing my attention right now
excellent okay for big question let's start with number one what is my purpose you use the phrase that I found very interesting marrying our purpose could you speak a little bit about the question what is my purpose in and how do we marry our purpose or why should we marry our purpose how do we know it's worth marrying Consciousness is purposeful we have will we have volition and there's a way in which were always trying to find meaning behind everything my mother was a sociologist and she studied symbolism in human society and she was always talking about how humans try to find meaning and they create symbols or they relate to various emblems and so forth and then there's the idea of the logos which is come into this phrase now what's your logo
 a company that starts with the idea that there's a purpose p
everybody knows that if you start a company and they go what do you exist for it's like I don't know companies that start with your vision mission so our lives also have that and it's so exciting when you know where you're going and sit to take the time to ask what's the purpose if you stand outside a baseball game so I'm wearing just a clipboard you ask people what's your purpose
 I don't know I mean I'm not saying every might sit with some people might have more comprehensible answers but it's so clarifying when you take time to discover what is the purpose of my life even if you just take a little time and write down your priorities you'll notice that your mind becomes focused and you become energized because we want to go somewhere specific and we don't want to just leave everything to Randomness here and be pulled Along by the forces of nature
do you have some practical advice or practical application around
 identifying one's purpose if I do and I've done it myself and it's really helped me a lot get a legal pad and a pen
 dick recommends using Bic pen we don't want to use a nail legal pad ice a legal pad cuz it gives a psychological advantage you thinking I have a lot to say here and
 sit down in a quiet place
 and give yourself time put a do not disturb sign on your door and put one on your own mind that we're not doing anything else right now except being introspective and take a little time it's amazing how purpose-driven we really are but we don't take time to prioritize
put them in order so start with what are my priorities
 what's the most important things to me in my life and if you put them on paper first brainstorm don't worry that they're in the right order but just start writing down what's most important to me this is highly enlightening exercise and what you'll find is you might first feel that it's a little confronting that oh what I don't want to know what my purpose is I'd rather live in a random world where I just go mindlessly from one thing to the next and follow whatever my routine is now it's good enough that's not very exciting in life in fact it's something that the srimad bhagwat times has better a moment of full Consciousness and a lifetime of scrolling so if you have this a time for yourself you're so intelligent because
you're being informed by a higher intelligence all of us are every second and if we can turn ourselves in by being a little quiet and just asking ourselves what is my purpose what is my purpose right at the top of the page and you'll find that your intuition comes in very strongly when you do that and you'll be amazed I was amazed at how much I miss when I don't ask that question so then you write write them down as Benny purposes as possible and then let it marinate and think about it as you're walking around you'll think oh no this one goes a little higher discuss it with one of your friends or your significant other end and you'll you'll put things in place and when you get things 12345 you'll start to see a pattern like now I know what I really live for one of the points I made in the book is that people often time
don't think about this until they get noticed that they're going to have to leave this present body which we all have to do and it can come unexpectedly and a woman wrote a book about this She interviewed she was a hospice nurse She interviewed so many people about their lives and she said most people become very introspective but it's at the last minute so with this is doing what is my purpose like do it now that's what in the box with some cuz she would probably so it gives us full permission to says your main purpose in life is to ask this question the other stuff is just support system don't get so absorbed in it and maintenance because maintenance is not that hard just get a routine going to maintain yourself but use it all to be very focused on what my highest purpose is
my Dharma what what what is it that you and there's two different ideas about Dharma right there's like kind of a relative Dharma according to where I'm at and you know it at this particular time and these particular circumstances maybe it was my Dharma to be a mother or father or two in the workplace I may have a particular Dharma may not be my Dharma down the road but it is for now
 and then it is there's kind of like higher Eternal Dharma that all living beings share the deepest purpose of all you know and how do we ever get there if you don't ask these questions will that brings us to the second question okay
 the guitar may I be of service that's it that is an underlying question and I'll just speak about it in a very practical way that maybe everyone can relate to have you ever been in an awkward social setting princess maybe it's awkward being
human social interaction is very complicated and we have our egos how do I look that I dressed right do I fit in here two people really like me even family gatherings people on their way to Thanksgiving at their home most awkward and maybe if you're a newcomer into a group you walk into a meeting whatever you think should I sit here so I sit in the back what am I supposed to do so this is almost as you're pointing out cuz she would provide a human asleep but it's really true we feel awkward in this world so how do we align here's a suggestion when you go to for instance a social Gathering when you get there ask this question of somebody who looks like they know what's happening there how may I be of service now let's just say I'll give you a hypothetical you walk into a place where you feel like should I talk to the the door person should I you know a stand over in the corner away to somebody talk to me
 go ask somebody how you
help what can I do as a let's just say they say oh yeah we got to set up these chairs you want to help and say yeah now and I have to be the awkward this is going to go away because all of a sudden you're an Insider and people who now or walking into going to owe this guy works here you know he's part of the thing right and this is Diamond how to be part of the real thing the real thing is serviced and this is what Lurch a Tanya talked to his disciples he said if you want to be a line if you want Dharma keep asking this question how may I be of service when I think when I think in terms of why aren't people serving me enough you got an airline's like where's my nap to do you know he's been it just brought me a cup no napkin where's the where's the Christmas snacks or whatever we become agitated immediately because that's not our wheelhouse our thing is service
 you mentioned this kind of
enjoyment or not see a shanor dedication you speak on that
 yeah the three paths this is generalized in the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the srimad bhagwat Tom so there's an idea that the material world is so inconvenient and one who comes to the conclusion it's never going to work out that person made that just say let's let's forget the whole thing let me help with a number line and the number line you have negative numbers 0 and the positive numbers now the path of material progress and enjoyment is called the negative numbers and is represented by karma karma is it that you have to pay so let's just say you're enjoying yourself in New York City on a credit card and then later when you get home you're going to have to pay the debt this is what The Vedas say are the negative numbers you're working for something
in which you're accumulating more debt so really they say you're going further and further the numbers are getting
 well technically they're not bigger cuz they're negative but I thought I was doing well but now I'm more so then one might come to the conclusion that let's just give up the whole deal and that means coming to zero and their many philosophies which accommodate that say your zero that there is nothing beyond pissed in 00 but actually The Vedas say you can't stay there because we're conscious beings and conscious beings want love they want aesthetic Beauty they want relationship just like if you're flying on a plane after four hours you get me out of here that's why they put a television in front of everybody now in the seats like just stay calm and look at the little bit little people on the screen you'll be okay
don't freak out we'll get you on the ground soon so we can't stay at zero but bhakti is the positive number it's the love it's the aesthetic Beauty it's the breaking bread together but it's for the higher purpose and when we have that then we have what our soul wants which is full engagement but in service and in love so the question how may be of service is like a direct path to that it's so aligning again the technology questions or technology they immediately a line us according to the quality of our questions will be aligned up accordingly and if we ask the question how many of service you brought up the word Dharma that puts us in Dharma and this the first question that's a nothing goswami asked to his teacher she take Tanya he said
who am I why do I exist what's my purpose and the large Italian said you're you're a servant Evans this answer that's your Dharma your your Eternal occupations to serve and counter-intuitive cuz where I was trained be the master you be the boss and then 7 some philosophy says there is no boss but boxy said there is a boss and you're the servant and be happy you know I like the way you started with a voice like Saint Seiya attend Zone public event
 and you spoke about awkwardness and we may feel awkward me we may feel isolated lonely alienated we show up there nobody talks to us we don't talk to anyone we walk away and we will continue to live in our body and I think that's an experience set
 that's very common particularly nowadays because you know where we generally tend to work far from where we live and live far from our family and then in all that did it anyways that I've never it's never been like that historical
extended it is right now so there's this kind of
 what's the word I'm looking for
 it just kind of discomfort in life where I was some kind of steady alienation that were feeling as we go through life and just a simple question like how may I be of service which active sounds like why do I want to serve but actually it's begin to open up a door to solving its kind of resolving all of that inner malaise is that the word I'm looking for something perfect work so that's maybe like that's the micro
 you know model of it but then this is kind of macro malaise that we have with the universe has been going on for many many many lifetimes and it's still the same you the answer is still the same question how may I be of service at this one question can kind of resolve our our our long-standing
you don't cause me discomfort that with that were stuck in this is the opening of the book it's a quote from the vedanta Sutra which is a summary of all the punishments which are the first Transit metal part of The Vedas for those who say enough's enough I want to know what's going on here I'm not satisfied with adjusting to the material world I want to know who I am and all the hundreds of aphorisms in the upanishads are then summarize in the Baytown to Sutra and the first point is ask the big question is inviting us it's calling us to do that and that end in g now do it now ask now while you have the chance and now means in fact, but explains this in the word apt October, Gina said I thought that means therefore and there's a lot in these Africans there are meant to be unpacked says therefore because you've tried
recent house and didn't work right there for because you've been in so many different bodies and therefore because now you're a human human is a special technology meant to ask the question the big questions I go ahead now you can do it now you do they give you that machine technology otherwise you can do all the secrets of the universe you just have to ask that's the main thing and that's the that's the opening point of the summary of all the transmittal parts of the Vedas is ask the right question don't be afraid to do that and if I may I just given an allergy because it's so perfect and I think of it frequently it's the example of the tiny screw that propagates I relate to this because I remember when I was a kid in 4th grade and we used to have these big wheel in a projector and all the kids we get happy because you're going to watch a movie rather than listen to the Future
and some kid while the teacher is out of the room and unscrewed a little part of that is just a tiny screw in it came out in a projector wouldn't work and we are very upset the kids were Prophet says when a loose screw is in the machine it's meant to serve then it's it's has a mighty purpose it's really doing something that is important and then when it falls out and it's
 in a far-flung place by itself if you find it you won't get one penny for it on what's up place where you sell everything online eBay yeah sure I selling a tiny screw on eBay you won't get a penny for it and so it doesn't have any significance so he said were like that when we're connected in service then we're so valuable and we feel it ourselves immediately but as soon as we're disjointed are we fall out of our
Karma our service then we feel worthless there's this sense of like what what am I here for it would become disoriented
 okay that that that's that's very helpful but not now you smoke a little bit on question 3 but when we just go a little bit deeper into it what is the lesson what's a heavy question and it's definitely the hardest one to ask because when we're suffering it and then again I don't recommend that we impose this upon others we we have to gently introducing her own life because suffering is real in the sense that although it's temporary is still when we're in a situation in this world where were hurting it it it's it's a very hard situation to be in an end to be glib and just say we'll just ask a question you know what's the lesson behind this it can be a little abrupt in that circumstance we have to be very careful with this question but it is extremely powerful and it comes from the show
which is the essence of wisdom of the sages it's a famous verse that says Shimano bhanjana Eve on the Home Depot, which is it
 and aligning verse that says a person who takes the whole universe as an opportunity to learn and become an improved him or herself by asking you know why did this why what is this meant to teach me said that person becomes eligible to go back to the spiritual world so is it's a maturing process when things happen to us it seemed like reversals of Fortune we have to be ready to gently with ourselves start to ask that question why why did this happen I was just going to say that sometimes I see these questions
the function of aphorisms that that you know cuz as soon as you start to feel the pain the mind will have its tendency to wallow 2247 pity or resentment or anger Focus externally but if like an aphorism if we just say hold it what is it let me know if we become accustomed to if it becomes a regular practice that when I feel a pinch let me ask this question at the end that just stops the moment the negative momentum and melee turns around and now you're moving in a positive direction what is the last of this so true cuz I like that because mine has its algorithms and then they got set in a certain direction loops? And especially this question what's the lesson brings changes they all grown over rights the default that scum in it's just that you're entitled to everything and everything should go perfectly you should be
sociable you'll be happy if you drink Coca-Cola excetera excetera and and all these kinds of ideas that are pervasive they're very powerful forces in our mind and when we introduced the wisdom of the ancient literature's which are inviting us to move to Higher Ground and we use the? Has that tool as you're saying I love how you put that I just use it as an aphorism to yourself keep asking yourself what's the lesson it helps in the process of forgiveness also is in forgiveness were hurting because somebody perhaps be betrayed our trust and it and that hurts and it's really hard to do to rectify but if if I take it to Higher Ground and I don't become complicit by saying that to I'm a victim and I say what's the lesson was I meant to learn but you know we might go as far as coming to this concept of Karma we're on a Continuum not many people want to go there cuz it why do bad things happen
the peoples like let's not talk about maybe talk about it and Talk Amongst yourselves and decide your own heart and and try to see like maybe I maybe I was involved in something where I betrayed some of these trusted maybe it came back to me at that could come up and it could help to balance out the way I look at the world in way I relate to people but as you said using it as an adverb is it after ISM and keep it going everything and eat or something there's a lesson in as a bug with Tom says in every aspect of nature there's a lesson waiting to be imbibed if we're able to keep that aphorism going what's the lesson behind this
 La Privada Princess 2 question number for big one where am I in vesting my attention
now
 this one's easier to ask and
 we all
 have the experience of feeling satisfied when were absorbed in the right thing
 Prince that I heard a quote is it's amazing how little you you get done when you're when you're not actually working on what you're supposed to for con I think of writing I have in order to write I have to get in his own I have to cross over it's like one of those pictures if you've ever seen kashuba where you look at it and it looks nondescript but if you stare at it long enough you flip over into a into a vision of those all the time here at the called stereogram I think something stereogram videos
 after looking at it for sometimes something in your brain clicks and then all the sudden you can see what
in the Apparently random bubbles or whatever they are and when we become absorbed in doing what a worthy task we all have this sense of feeling satisfied and you yourself have said which I've always appreciated amongst many of your teachings Is that real progress occurs in absorption really absorbed and this question brings us to a sense of how powerful we actually are we may forget our own power we were conscious entities Consciousness is amazing wherever we point our Consciousness there's a creative process that takes place where little creators of everything Center life where attention goes energy flows and so this is a a real lion in question where am I invest
my attention right now in fact I arguing it's of such value where is it something it's our only value actually our only real asset is our attention and and we get to choose where we replacing it that's a big thing and so what I argue in the book is because we're conscious beings and because we're creative wherever we place our attention which is up to us if we if we're able to find a discipline through which we can actually appreciate who we are and what the value of where we're placing our attention is and we ask this question it brings us where my investing so now we think of return on an investment Roi right I mean those who know about money they attend to everything every penny they make sure they're do they pay their bill to last minutes of the cash flow is going the money is working for them all the time
and that they know about compound interest one of the great wonders of the world and so forth right so we called return-on-investment how's that going for you but what we call it in the book has returned on attention Roa and the bug of agita addresses this Christian says if you're meditating on things be careful because you're going to go there you actually become one with those things for instance if you meditate on the car and you go in and one of the first lessons I learned when buying a car
 I read an article said don't love the car the car won't love you back if we love material hot chicks that we develop a sun go or connection to them Krishna says diet Elvish I am from Samsung gas station Vijaya take when you meditate he says on an object you put your attention there it becomes one with you and then that becomes a
we're carrying around all these things so the bug of agita is teaching us learn to direct your attention to Krishna and if Anna's I heard you say when we were together in London last year at Studio 108 you'd solve everybody's problems I remember that it was a it was a moment of Reckoning because somebody was asking about how to overcome anxiety and all the problems and you said well there's one real solution it's the think of Christians are there in the body of a kid that's the main point Mahna Mahna by the Muppets and if you do that then you have everything who is krishna's the source of everything it's like watering the root of the tree then all the branches are taken care of so it's it's the most consequential
 answer when we ask this question where my investing my attention right now we can go from
what's a moment and use this as an effort after ISM and continue at asking the question to realign because the mind wants to go to Crazy places and he's like what do you why do you want to go there sir what are you going to get out of that what happens if you've ever been scrolling and then you come across something that says you know you're going to rot your brain by doing this and go to turn it off so if we get if we become highly informed and and we are able to point our attention to the to Krishna then we'll feel naturally happy and what's more we won't miss anything cuz that's where everything comes from an introduction it was really kind of like an eye-opener the way that you kind of frame questioning that it's it's really the same dorm and power tremendous power that we all possess that we may not be engaging we made
happy engaging in the most effective way to find real satisfying to find a satisfying life and so you also kind of frame this song you know you you you you you use this phrase that our power is always in the present moment
 very very interesting right now there's that's it is not lying in the future it's not it's it's here right now this is where if we all want power we all probably off and feel powerless I have this power is right here in this moment and then you kind of qualified this thing about where attention goes by using the term full attention you spoke on full attention and it's it's on
 we had a gathering at my home at some was going to say just listen to that were in town on Friday evening and we got together with reading 15 chapters
such an important chapter Set set set such a condensed wisdom in that chapter in you know what in the very last verse to wrap things up Christian says you know this is the greatest secret of all that the ancient scriptures you know what I just shared with you and you know we tried something and I thought that you were actually good for said that we should study these books backwards and forwards or am I just thinking that I know you said threadbare we have a system at Art Center in California where we memorize certain parts of the and we have to do that the highest level that you can achieve as you do them forwards and then backwards what you know Wheatley retracted okay well then what you know it sometimes it's interesting to read something backwards right cuz cuz I literally backwards but
but it makes you ask questions in other words this is the greatest secret of all of the ancient scriptures what is the greatest secret of all this and then you go backwards to find the answer I see their Christian says whoever knows me is the pre-show too much that's a pretty in person right without doubting
 is the knower of everything
 and they therefore and in their this is part of the secret they engage in devotional service to me and Crystal uses the term sarva bhavana
 like with full attention with full Hardware it fully invested that's where the that's where you really that then you really gets it then you really know everything you've you find the deepest answer is Right due to the to the to the biggest questions
 so in case you are my example of that fully hearted devoted questioner and servants and in and so on all that you really live
