 got another day of cute and you're new to the show Welcome questions and answers day you got questions
and they're burning you inside right to Miss Mara wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com and she'll put them in our put them on our list okay this is from Abigail 108b of the Discord thread destroy thread is alive and happening isn't it I don't check it I don't check it much anymore but it is it's a lot going on. I used to check in the old days
 can you kindly explain the three principal Energy's internal external and marginal in a way that is clear for condition Souls like us thank you
 incisive questions in a sweet way to but if these are three principles were here internal external energy marginal where the marginal marginal were marginal gains we can go either way I C I I can really see my marginal this wasn't that a hardcore band marginal man or some marginal man
Shrek Forever After those guys name Margie bhakti proper use of that word marginal I wonder it looks it's what sets a translation from marginal marginal is the translation of contesta
 attached to Shawty yeah. See what does that word mean marginal has to do with like the board of building at the margin anyway I can see my own wife look at go ahead look it up it's sometimes good marriage where's Mara
 dictionary okay then yeah I don't look it up marginal subscribe to their dictionary marginal
relating to her situated at the edge of your margin of something okay well then what is marching mean margin means the edge of order something and it's almost embarrassing to say but sometimes I like a devotee cuz I don't want to watch sometimes it's like I'm so Krishna conscious and then I'll send it to listen listen listen to me and then all the sudden in a moment I'm not at all that we can get swayed almost like a pile like a weather vane into our conscious and sometimes I feel very green accountant and sometimes here and sometimes I could just the way the other way to feel like
 no nothing I want nothing of this and that's that's the point of that's that's our position as the Jesus all your souls and Bodied
 and wanted somebody
either way then we're training ourself is to go the way of God which is our natural way we're recommending the natural path we're recommending the authentic path we're recommending the sincere path because it's what we essentially are that is R-Truth R-Truth is that we are essentially a spiritual being but because we're conditioned we can go either way and we have these days we feel very focused very spiritual very grounded and then we have these days you're like oh what's it all about and I'm attracted to all this types of glitter of the material world
 that's my statement for marginal you want to share the other ones out a bit because I sent you it was you know there's this rug and I think we're going to talk I'd appreciate it try to go back to my dictionary for you but
tell me some of the crazy chicken
 let's Zoom it out there's there's a important statement from the upanishads punch out of statement sarva called me dumb, which basically means that everything is Brahman right like which accessories like everything is spiritual energy
 well then what do we make of this world
 like what is this world that this is kind of fundamentally where the difference between the two different
 ideas of a don't disagree right that the body of a Toronto and the Midway to vedanta because how do you explain the song of call be done, everything is Brahman everything is spiritual energy they say it if everything is spiritual energy but we're moving around in this world and it's not spiritual Retreats BBC's temporary changing his goddamn characteristics
then they say they must all be false it's all totally losing it actually doesn't exist I want to live in that world but I can't adopt that philosophy actually doubt that it does so what what what the box of Atlantis say
 is that everything is spiritual energy but that spiritual energy transported manifest in different ways and that's where this example comes of this song that we were thinking about yesterday Rugrats about the breed this is from she'll probably go to talk about how electricity can be transformed into like air-conditioning or Refrigeration or the same electricity can transform and say he needs a heater in electric chair so this is provided he was on a morning walk in Los Angeles
 right we're going to do about the extra yep okay and he said like an expert electrician the same energy might the same Brahman
Sarah called me dumb Burma it's all the same energy just like an expert electrician the same Energy electric it can be converted into heat it can be converted into Refrigeration the energy is the same both places the electricity is working but by his expert management like the electrician right by his expert management
 one is heater one is cooler but he didn't pull a completely different just opposite and then he quotes the Piranhas this estate in the Vishnu purana precious shut the over the dive as she promises both matter and spirit there the energy of the Supreme so the energy or the energetic and I'm different
 in other words Christians energy is Krishna and a manifest in a variety of ways
it's all Brahmin because it's all Christmas energy and Christmas spirit so so so therefore we six are becoming dumb, we understand it's all Christians energy but it transforms in different way so probably continue this is so the energy the energetic non different but by his arrangement one is working at Superior that the internal actor energy in one is working as inferior that's the external energy the same example the same electricity electric energy is acting is cooler and acting is heater but the energies the same simile originally the energies God's energy so God's energy and God there's no difference but by his manipulation one is working as material energy others working as spiritual energy this is the difference
 therefore originally it all becomes all spiritual energy life right matter matter develops
from life rather than life developing from matter this is this is this is this is the date of understanding so so we say Saba call to do a mod that that one spiritual energies manifesting in different ways in and if we're going to break down the categories it can be broken into many categories but you can break at first into three categories and we could say the spiritual energy the material energy the spiritual Andrew call into internal energy
 and then there's the external energy which is the material energy
 we're we said that we are spark a spiritual energy but we're in a material body operating with material mind in the material realm right and buts were called marginal because although we're made of spiritual energy we have the tendency the nobility
 say like this first
 by Nature were subordinate to one of these Energies
that's what we'll take shelter one or the other and as you were saying can shift by the minute right away in the walking the streets of Boston looking for trouble he also would use the example of the beach like there's that area of the beach that one minute is covered by water and then the next second you know it's it's it's One S land next second option isn't it so the Geva would let you know that the soul we are by Nature we take shelter Christian
 but we were granted for the purpose of divine log were granted free will
 and with that free will we may choose that any
call me to take shelter or we could say to be covered by the illusory energy by Nature where were in in the reality of divine love for Krishna but then we have the propensity to be covered over by the material energy and when that happens we had into fight with the material energy we take shelter it I need U external material things to be happy you know when we take shelter that so we're taking Shelter One Way or Another you know but but marginal means were right in between We Are Spiritual energy no doubt we have the propensity to be influenced by the material energy and therefore called marginal so those are the three internal external marginal we are that marginal energy but the practice of bhakti yoga is to redirect our attention or are
 what you say or attention really our awareness our Consciousness to Krishna Consciousness to focus it on the internal spiritual energy thought you could say
the spiritual realm the spiritual world is composed of that internal energy it's it's our natural home it's just our natural shelter
 turn back to it we're making yesterday it's not like okay now I'm going to try to be a Harry Krishna it is like we are naturally devotees of God that's what we match that is our default it's nothing weird it's nothing foreign it's the most authentic turning seeing yourself as something bigger that's a very authentic place to be seeing ourselves as not the center all you have to do is walk around this world treating yourself like you're the center of everything you're going to find a lot of hate thrown at you you'll never be able to live up to that and the material realm will not support you being the center you'll come crumbling down but if you see yourself as Tiny part of something bigger hear Born To Give Love here
deserve it'll feel very very natural in your life
 ready yeah he's being subordinate as Eternal Servants of the Supreme
 the g-bomb has the deepest holes for the atomic living entities that's us must remain under the control of either the internal external potency
 when they're under the control of the internal potency they display their natural constitutional activity namely constant engagement devotional service to the Lord but that's our nature that's when we take shelter did the external energy unnatural because we are Eternal and we're taking shelter of the temporary energy and it just creates so much stress but I've got I got a I'm going to question for you sir I want to hear your answer cuz it's comes up a lot with us people in America were
unless we're really sort of like we don't like this idea of I'm a servant we say this is a setup for a codependent relationship we say I've had traumatic relationships I felt abused what happens if a person is going with a heart wide open into some type of atmosphere environment where they where they where they actually get sort of manipulated then what good is there offering if someone is not actually receiving that offering and handing the guy but using that person and taking advantage of that person well I suppose in the context of all we've been speaking
 we said that by Nature were taking Shelter One energy or the other but sometimes the material Energy may appear to us to be the spiritual energy you know that's going to get internet question has he would just all about like understand the nature between the
relationship between the disciple in the guru a lot of times even within that context what the disciple really wants is something material
 interesting huh and so it's really the external form that they're taking shelter of rather than the internal sure if you were supposed to see which the guru's meant to deliver
 and so that that could be a problem whether the guru may be real at bona fide or or an imposter and either case if one's focused if one's focus on the external rather than the internal it can it can be it it will be a problem but dumb but my point was we need to become expert at recognizing the spiritual we need to her that's that's the key when we recognize the spiritual then we can take shelter of it but if we haven't recognized
they were taking shelter but even in the name of it not actually taking shots with spiritual energy well I was going to say if there was the opposite if I have a very sincere offering the person I'm offering back to is corrupt God still sees the offering of my heart I don't I don't lose it might be that sell, that's a little that one say that's the opposite I would say in one sentence the same thing that you're saying
 you all you were saying that the disciple has ill intentions were wrong intentions are not pure intentions I'm saying the good intentions but my point is so so still that disciple was focused on the spiritual rather than they were focused on the internal Essence rather than the external Assad yes so that since we said okay but maybe we'll get more into your that question as we take on question number to hear
are you still ready number 2
 kitchen on the Chandra and I think this grew out of
 conversations in this age group may be okay
 is part of a much longer question but we've chopped it up no we didn't have each other each other look at can you speak on the dance
 between faith and Goro vs. having a relationship that is overly dependent on each other on those are just the other day while I was out a sheet on each or a boost and the guru teaches you have to think rather than what to think
 what do you think your dad think rather than what to think
the idea of a guru is a girl shouldn't be disempowering the guru should be empowering you know just so you can look at it like a parent to parent wants to empower the child doesn't want to make this as your child grows up you want to soar like give them a leg up help them establish themselves as an independent being and you know that maybe give them some money or give them a car but they don't want them living in your house when they're 35 years old unless they're in from India Indians live with their family for their welcome it at least in America when is recognized time to Flap flap your wings and start moving forward in India is very normal you live with your parents until you're married and not criticizing them not criticizing that it's a wonderful thing in America which were like okay move along anyway the idea is we want to we don't want to enable them hand them so
much money and comfort that they don't get a job and get get their life together
 we want to empower them and leave them in a way that's going to make them a little bit more independent
 so you have a guru if I'm always saying should I go left should I go right what should I do with my life and just lay that stuff first of all you don't lay that stuff on the guru and you don't want your Guru taking away all your power also said the guru has to have their head on straight or else it's it does become co-dependent enabling relationship at the same time the disciple also has to be a little bit independent-minded and and a good glue should teach that
 we think I agree with a different for every as up as a parent I know this every child is going to be different certain children need more in
Russian is certain children do you have the back off it's better for them to figure stuff out on their own
 it was just like we chanting in the morning generally when we're doing Bob with him home again it's about on this year what's the translation
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge you know what other words are meant to give Vision right that the group was meant to help the disciple see in a different way right see this world in a different way she understand you can say see your perceive understand their own identity in a different way
 understand how to navigate through this world with this Vision right and once they have the vision
 the instructions are to help develop that Division I once they have the division out of sight once they have the vision
so what are you talkin about you're mixing in rhyming words or not they have the vision okay
 then you don't need to keep asking question you can see for yourself if you never only if you never develop that division or will you constant need to be instructed in every detail right sometimes it's sometimes you approach to go to what should I do about this what should I do about that it's like you know what to do with giving everything in front of you they just got to choose there comes a point where you off you have to develop some independent thinking where you got to say Okay I want to choose down to do this it's like you can't just rely on everybody to give you all the answers but but it's I think the confusion is let me say this first before we move on
 that even though you developed this
it's not that you say okay great now I don't need you anymore goodbye
 in particularly particularly when it is actually that's the way the that's the way Prop Hunt described
 how did wait and see the guru
 even how they see Krishna
 I needed you to get to a certain platform now that I have you now that I've reset platform I don't need you anymore as a matter fact you're very form is illusion so you're taking this a whole nother Direction here okay whereas the mountains
 not only do they receive instruction from the guru in terms of
 and this kind of Divya Gana it like in other words
 this conventional vedanta of like understanding the nature of the South the nature of this world the nature of God that's like all important
 you know this is in order to be able to do
between matter and spirit that's like really important stuff to become free but we're also very interested in the the more esoteric side of bhakti so another psychic how will I understand bhakti how will I understand devotion how will I understand look how will I understand the unique
 devotion of the residents of Robin how will I understand the unique love of of the gopis and unique love of Radha so that it will awaken in me. So that I that should have said that's like a whole another level of inquiry you know and that's something also the disciple should also begin to understand on their own but all that being said
 you know it's let's let's zoom out just a bit first again lets him out right
 there's a lot of Britain
 Josh
a lot of texts a lot of sacred text that speaks of the disciples attitude towards the brew as very reverential and and investing complete dependence in right like I completely need you as I take full shelter you know cuz because if we zoom out you know the cause of our Perpetual suffering is that we live in a very deep state of Illusion actually we're going to wear identifying the bodies to self and identifying external objects as the source of our happiness. That's a confusion that we are like we've been trapped in that illusion for a very very long time
 and if it's going to take a tremendous amount of conviction
 first to turn away from that into Focus or absorption in our faith on the going back to the previous question on the internal spiritual energy
as opposed to the extra material energy I could hear this flush when we could become armchair philosophers and we could you know sit around and talk it at that. You know we can go to some party on Long Island all dressed in white clothes and drink and drink and some kind of a cooling drink in and talk about like Eastern philosophy and even our gurus and and not develop never developed the conviction
 all of this is an allusion in my happiness is not found in this and I and I need to radically turn from that to develop that it's like you do remember in the in the Matrix where is kind of like the guru figure which was named Morpheus
 is is kind of prodding
are the disciple name what's the name what's the name of it it was like training him it is kind of like near the first kind of he kind of part into the idea okay I'm in a virtual reality all right now and I'm going to train you how to fight in the virtual reality but in order to do this you need to understand 100%
 that this isn't real that this is is a is a virtual computerised program that you're living in and and then they would fight right they be doing the karate and martial arts and and and Marcus will keep beating and I keep eating and keep eating them is it because you have not understood yet you really need to focus you really need to develop his conviction it's not it when you're living deep in the illusion it's hard even when you're starting to buy into it
theoretically for that conviction to become completely fully rooted so that you begin to see the world through new eyes that's going to require a tremendous amount of face and therefore there's all of these instructions and shastra bad it in a sense of saying hey this guy's and just some nice new teacher
 it's kind of like this is your lifeline to get the hell out of like unlimited lifetimes of a cycle of birth and death and ups and downs and all kinds of suffering recognize it for what it is get this through your head so there's like a lot of there's a lot of lot of written work that's really trying to highlight that idea so that we take shelter with with that. Otherwise that her Jessie will escape and are you going to have some pop and all the sooner it'll say rerouting and it's sort of like spinning
Brown like what am I doing with my life now rerouting another Direction and we're fully going in that direction until that says rerouting an estimate to your life when we finally hit that wall what have I been doing what I've been doing all these years rerouting and we've just been wrongly programmed for lifetimes Mia steps in says ok programs over let's put the actual directions in way off the map you're going to complete the wrong direction in elected to the groomer recognize you've bought into all of this theoretically but actually you haven't really bought into it at heart and so you know it is it's always going to be our tendency to relevant eyes the guru you know that those are some interesting and others if we do rabbit Isaac if we just say you know what I was reading Bertrand
Shuffle the other day and do some really interesting stuff there and then representative of the internal spiritual energy through their words and through their actions they are vibrating that energy is a completely different energy it's not a relative energy it's an absolute energy isn't it entirely different category recognize that this is a very different source of knowledge there's a lot of great teachers who teach things like health and sort of like stress relief and calmness and mindfulness they're not these they're not I only like to use this word anymore cuz it's been appropriated by one person it's not a suck Guru Guru it teaches eternality of the Soul not just good things to add to
good good types of mindfulness meditation or or Fitness adjustments with within the material external energy to live a happier or more fulfilling life and energy that whenever I hear people say that word guru ji is this person actually your Guru like does he give Brayden from birth and death is he is he a liberated Soul was he teaching you like physical practice which is good thing it's also type of teacher but it is a difference between a one of those teaching you eternality of the Soul because then that person they might not have the body you like or they might have some idiosyncrasy don't like but you should understand what they actually are vibrating that is the lifeline for the Geva and there may be at like a material teacher was it a self-help teacher who seems like all their ducks are in a row and they're they're perfect in every Regard in material qualifications but the but the
GPS it will eventually go to some
 place that's still a material place and we need to show I'm going to say throw them out use them for some other type of material well-being bought well-being of the mines but we have to understand that there is an actual destination of the Geva yes for furthermore
 you know there's will find that you know a lot of texting that one should remain a fool before their girl you know that's at me and so does that mean okay I'm always an idiot the groomer doesn't want you to remain a fool right it just means I can do that one too easy because it it's like a teenager again when you're saying hey when you take the car out tonight remember to I know Dad I know Dad when they went to
teenager says I know Dad you know they're not listening to anything you're saying even though you might say something incredibly valuable like listen you got to change the oil when you see it go to 18000 every 60 going to change the oh I know Dad okay you don't know that it's going to ruin your warranty if you don't go over if you can go over it so there is like a woman they say up here like a fool it means don't be like I know Guru Maharaj
 even if I have to build decorations because actually if you've developed that spiritual vision that the group supposed to help you develop then when you look at the guru
 you're seeing past the externals of the group asked their body passed through their eyes and the Beautiful look as big as the guru is beautiful or even you say the external defects right.
to the limp yeah yeah or their accent or their their videos whatever it is and what you're seeing is now there's about the spirit of it and you're seeing this is a delegation of Krishna right just like the bug of agita is a delegation of its Krishna
 you know it Chris has vibrating through this book so then I don't put this book on the ground I put it to my head sure right in the same way one looks at the Blue Room
 set up Christmas vibrating through this being there for I place my head at their feet right even after I've learned everything especially after I've learned everything sure that type of respect reverence you do remains
 but it's butter and therefore we find likes a even rug or not. Swiss Army right like who we can serve the priority
are you like the priority and Charming he is the great teacher of the conclusion the Perfection of this path right in its most esoteric manifestation you know that the love of the that the gopis have for Krishna and he prays to his Crews right what is the Paragon Theater this winter
 not a Shostakovich Aaron I can depend on as he praised the pregnancy you've given me this you giving me that I'm fully dead it to my grde if I don't wake him up he said you put ceramic Russell by Radical Something About Tobias yeah but if she go
 be nice mirror translation
a piece a cheap with rum to this person who's giving me the son of Sachi the sellers Dodge dealership Tanya serve yeah I'm fully indebted to Sri Guru Dave
 who gave me the Holy Name containing the highest point of thought aspiration in and ideal
 he gave me the service of the greatest savior the son of Massachusetts animal hospital was like a golden Mountain indicating the way to Krishna Leela
 Shih Tzu that has brought me to Sri Rupa
 I was ordered to distribute recertify for me who just our position in relation to rug a new gibati who Dave has brought me to regimen to let it burn. We're Radha and Govinda perform their Past Times
where the Forest Hills and every creeper shrub and grain of sand are stimuli to help me remember Radha Govinda he's giving me right of Clint and your article 49
 and he has given me the Assurance of all of these so I bow my head with deep respect unto his Divine Lotus feet
 at this is the fully realize person with a full vision who's received it all
 and still he's has this reverence respect ultimately love for the figure of the guru so this emphasis is given their there's so much evidence is so that we will
 honor and respect this manifestation of spiritual teachings and spiritual truth cuz it's so rare and it's so important and in order to receive it and understand and not relevant eyes it's so much as there's so much there
okay and so now to get to the other side of the question because it's been on the charger is saying there's this dance right how did he phrase it
 so can you speak on the dance between faced and grew so that's the face in the respect in the honoring and in all of that and having a relationship that is overly dependent
 it always has to be focused on the internal it always has to be focused even what's happening externally the internal purpose is always the point right the opening of the eyes of the disciple the appreciation of all that is spiritual the development you know of of love for Krishna that is always the essence of this relationship that is that's where it's going that's its purpose that's that you know from beginning to end
 so what are Tennessee because we were made to the condition state is to try to find try to suck some happiness or some meaning of some prestigious the same things that we're looking for in the external world
cuz we're not free of it yet we bring it into that you can into that car into that spear to contact between the the guru in the disciple so we want a certain Guru so that we got a certain name and we appear certain way to people some of them get the prestige that we've always been looking for you know things like that you know what what's what's most sacred you know becomes we we just kind of
 see it in the in the material context and a kendit degruy can also be prone to this if they're not deeply Advanced group and they can also be prone to the same kind of games they may they may get off on the external Prestige they may want to siples that are always like fools and so they can always be posing as they've learned it in realized instructor where is like a genuine
is actually the greatest Joys to see the disciple advancing the see the disciple actually becoming Guru themself you know like that for the for the Brewer then this like the even they're beginning to honor the principal Guru in the disciple
 right I like this so you know I was thinking something to reach this recent there is kind of a I definitely don't want it like boiled down the
 did the the guru disciple Dynamic to a simple formula
 but at the same time there's some there's something there like say you want to learn Sanskrit
 you go to a Sanskrit Guru
 you spend about 12 years
 now you know Sanskrit now you can teach Sanskrit right now you can be the guru and it's it is a fact that you know 10 years 12 years sometimes they say there's like a 10000 hours
formula kind of thing I'm not saying it is definitely not saying it's exactly like that but what I am saying is
 we should learn from the guru and then in a sense we should be Gore's ourselves in one sense or another like we should learn to sign to bucking know how to practice it and become purified by it and then be able to represent ourselves that's the that's what the is the guru is is effective and the disciple is receptive
 then that is the dynamic will take place in it and after and I see this immature disciples mature Growers I see after those disciples been around 15-20 years
 the guru doesn't relate to them as a child anymore now that the disciples steal even more in am in the most genuine way
 feeling honoring that girl but the girl was kind of treating them like
 a little bit more like a duck
I supposed to say. But like that they have this respect for you are real life stuff and now you've you've matured and their father has an eight-year-old son or a 28 year-old Sons act like it's really really different from
 yeah yeah so so so if we you know I'm not a I'm not a psychologist or anything but you know you know there's all kind of psychologist show me the dynamic relationship Dynamics out of there and they can easily be brought into this let's try to understand what it is for real for real
 and end in always recognize it
 granted the instructions that are given there in the sacred text that speak about the mood of the disciple for the guru they put you in a vulnerable position
but it said vulnerable position that's the most receptive position to so you just got to you just got to really take this seriously and understand who do I open up to clean my opening up to are they real are they counterfeit
 all right
 any more Santa Rosa
 I hope it covered it well
 Andre via Discord next question I want to know are there stages where you feel more attracted to hearing enchanting than praying at all I just feel sometimes when I sit down and pray my apostolate apostalic Christian PTSD prevents me from praying the champion feels like home as a neophyte devotee how do I get the taste for praying as well
Midas a chance feel like dancing but not like usually it's the other way around people say it I can't get it to Channing but I like to pray well dancing is a type of prey sometimes you have to really think about it like that I think it helps me to think about like that it helps me explain it when people say hey what are you doing walking around mumbling with your hand in that bag I got to say you don't have a prayer actually I'm calling the calling. Into my life so you can look at your chanting I was praying and then sometimes I feel like you just want to share o Krishna this is how I'm feeling today but if you're just attracted to chanting for now just keep on chanting all the stuff will come
 but you can't forget that Christian is a person I'd like to remember Christian as a person and I want to present myself to Krishna Krishna this is how you doing today how are you doing today Krishna you can talk to Krishna like that is your friends
I think praying will just come naturally
 if you're attached to Champion the holy name that's a great thing about feels like home what a great place to be and again usually especially in our culture it's the opposite people are just like I can pray as chanting I can order with chatting is the simplest thing isn't it
 probably would say you know what should we think about we were chatting and probably said just just chanting here it is it the experience of of that chanting is something that will hopefully mature and grow and manifests in all kind of beautiful ways but but the action itself is very simple and if and if you feel
 some comforter some satisfaction in the in the simple practice of chanting and hearing that chanting that's wonderful and
I agree with you I think the other limbs Bucky will come but I also think
 as you're chanting matures or let's say as you can within you should arise a desire to the chant on the next level right always always hope you know this must go deeper that feeling should always be there for the dirt right this must go deeper it's a healthy to eat a healthy tension there in a very healthy way now I'm chasing those something I'm beginning to realize that there's still so much more I want to get there and when you and when you start to feel that in relation to your chanting you will pray
 you will naturally prey because you're going to realize
 it's Krishna the gifts that it's the Holy Name that gives that you will pray to the name itself you will pray to Christian in the form of that name
 I want to know you
I want to know you and to love you more deeply than I do now please reveal yourself to me and ended some form or another that prayer will come out of you you know and it'll be genuine it won't be on in a matter fact that prayer
 as as the as you begin to realize what his name is
 you're not only going to just pray to go deeper you'll actually begin to beg for it
 you know you will you will be getting you. I will help you get the bag
 and that is now we go back to the first question you know where this marginal energy
 you are ill become more and more clear this bagging is when we think about anything of the Baggers like the lowest person is like that will will beg
 feeling I like I'm the lowest person
 but in a completely different context and how we have that free
you're mine now Dear Christa I am this tiny little spark of dust right I'm so vulnerable in this world you know that your your material energy due to my false
 did you do to my my
 ignorant
 unhealthy self-centered desires
 I turned her towards your external energy that energy is overpowering me I am so insignificant of that energy is like so powerful
 I'm just turning to you help me save me
 please reveal yourself to me through your name all that I hear that the grade vaishnav is when they change the name that tears come into their eyes that their voice chokes up that their hair stands on end with goosebumps none of that I'm not experiencing any of that when will that take home
all experienced at 2 I know I'm not worthy
 I know that I know I'm not some qualified Yogi that's super self-disciplined and I know that I'm tying insignificant available please please just turn your mercy to me even one drop of you that this is how this is how our charges pray this is how they taught us to pray and that will come natural you know when you're here involved with time and when you chanting you know where we'll come you you'll you'll see you know you'll see so it's not as if you're if you're finding satisfaction and comfort and dumb
 in the chanting and in hearing keep doing it and the praying will come if if you're at Channing and hearing is is effective if you're doing it right
 then you're going to start to pray we will make you all beggars
dumb
 do all the way there is a packet are commercial wrote the book called the dagger I think her yes
 the background that's all you want that's all we want when we start to beg when we actually start to beg with true sincerity
 that Peggy is going to feel wonderful wonderful because we'll finally be situated in truth it's like if there's if the wave of of of psychic credibly refreshing to be establishing truth it's a wonder that bag and you're finally back in the other day like my spiritual dream the other day that you have to be completely mahraj what should I what should I learn what should I study which esoteric book should I read just because should I just or should I just become humble is in that bag and situation or actually fully empty then that transcendental vibration change that all knowledge can come through Guru and fill you up that was
the train rug
 I've had enough
