 it's like sad it's like I'm looking for Wikipedia is going to talk about how you got it okay if the day that commemorates the harrowing of hell Wikipedia is Wikipedia Saturday is the harrowing of Hell while Jesus Christ's body laying at 2

heat that the reservation was celebrated that's how the pagans celebrate at least a marshmallow rabbits and jelly legs and the chocolate industry step down there and they came over all right
 what's Farrah made all this incredible like she makes her own candy too I didn't realize this about you she made like you do realize that it's interesting that you don't realize because once on Christmas when she gave me a whole collection of candies you claimed it was from you but you got a credit for not getting you anything nice jacket I gave you just my hand on her sorry about that pursued him so that was far more valuable actually

and every Saturday we do questions and answers from our audience so we have a whole list of questions were going to go through your trip going to try our best we got that over a thousand episodes if you don't know where to begin start today or maybe the 1300 getting some people like to go back to the beginning so you like to do both some people like to binge while on long drives do whatever you like it all works at the eating a banana take me to the top or the middle or the bottom it all is sweet stuff cuz the sweet stuff is coming from the bottom of time itself from the sages not us the actual sages all right so we're going to go right to our questions unless bear has got some meetings today at 9:30 11 and 12:30 and there's no doubt there's no show tomorrow but there is urban Davie be at the bhakti center at 11 a.m.
what we can figure it out urban city women Davie goddess Urban you don't have to live in the city you're not allowed to even ask that question we're going to have to read Brandon Davies hanging out loud in there every month via the bhakti Center website information is online and this week the speaker is Rimini poddar you know it was probably started a New York City of the Bahia Center and then Zoom happened I hope they ran that public and now you can like be living in the forest and we can call yourself an urban baby which is a misnomer and I'm happy about it let it go let it go
 going to die on this hill org
here's the question this is from Ryan really nice guy who came on pilgrimage with me last fall himself that he wrote this question a via email which is can you clarify the practice of java Java is repetition of the of sacred names on Indian Rosary I like to call it even though the rosaries came from the job I'm always with your ancient is 108 beads and you would chant a mantra I need to be Susan can you clarify that this practice of Joppa a relative newcomer like me is japa synonymous with kirtan
 can other meditative practices enhance our Java or do they distract us from the main thing right the main thing here in the Holy Name Is Christmas love this is another question face Christians love inherent in the sound of the Mantra or
the purity of Our intention
 I feel the benefit of Joppa and kirtan in my heart and knee light you can shine on the subject is dearly appreciate it
 a good question is if you haven't experimented with Joppa we're going to encourage everybody to do it today take some time aside on this holy of holies this to sit with some beads if you don't have to be it's just so you know what I've done what I've lost my beans I've made them out of a string I made them in like a shoelace you know a new shoe lace and I did not attend 108 speeds in a 100 knots in a beat I just chatted on that when I was on tour and I lost my beads but sit and try and we chant the maha-mantra on each bead okay
 it's different than here Thomas's first question cuz tuba is it different than cuz it's synonymous with your time your answers know your just not
open time it's sunk your time with singing with the Sangha were singing all together and glorifying Krishna and those that type of chanting of Christian in the name can either be Nam cure time we're actually chanting the name or Lila kirtan over chanting the pastimes of Krishna and we say yeah you should I do Lala Golden Nugget or Paula or saying these stories of Christmas Past Times that's a little bit different
 is krishna's love inherent in the sound of the Mantra by miss the answer that one first. It seemed like that was there to did the next sentence was part of that question right yeah yes Christmas love inherent in the sound of the Montreux or the purity of Our intention I'm not sure I fully understand this but I think I may like you just say the sound very Christian to her or is it
to do with the intention to come to me like yeah right yes so it's so backed up I remember back when we were in my poor it was on show the buckets in 12 starts about 2 tacos Parents Day 150th this matter fact that we read a quote from him that was really important
 and that was that he said that when we chant this Mantra it shouldn't be just lick deep
 it should be hard to keep that's that would say his question about intention has a purpose so if I'm understanding him correctly and other which we could be vibrating the syllables without Ashley vibrating
 the name of Krishna there's a famous verse about
 about Krishna and his name this from the Padma purana is a spot in the chase on your charts and Rita
you know this one for you solemn Saturday nama
 in the second word is chintamani not much until Monday rupam Krishna Krishna Krishna straighten your ass Allegra give me off 32 words you should be the humiliations upon your point of shoe do Dennis from nama nama know if we want to understand that now I'm a touch of you know if you want understand what is Christian's name this is an important verse to to consult the holy name of Krishna is it something for people that like our new to this culture and everything they just sound very unusual and strange
and maybe some of the later questions kind of relate to this is that within this
 Theology and philosophy of of they don't and if you could save a box of it onto the understanding as the box of Yogi is understood they don't. They explained that essentially the material energy and spiritual energy our bodies are made of material energy our minds are made of material energy we are made of spiritual energy Krishna and his entire realm or made of spiritual Angie and Chris is Christian's name is made of spiritual energy ISM and this is the part that's like difficult for us to wrap our heads around in in the in the material Realm
 there's an object in the object has a name and those things are kind of arbitrary in other words just like arbitrarily that name was granted to that object right right we have
piano yeah it's like the name has been arbitrarily attached to that object it could have been any other name in any other language is still attached other names to that object to the country or the boot the trunk a violin the same thing but it's sort of arbitrary and sometimes it changes over time and it's not that you couldn't have more than one name but the ideas that would stay with the spiritual energy the name and the object of the name or no difference they are wanted it something
 they may require some faith in the beginning but it but as one contemplates over the course of time it all begins to make sense of it and the ideas that you can we can commune with Krishna the most accessible way when we're stuck here in this material Realm
in the most success is here he's everywhere once he's in her heart is in the heart of every living being but we have difficulty accessing him there even though he's right there as close as can be even though he's right there within a we have a difficult time accessing and being aware that most you walk around out of touch with that so it said that the most easily accessible
 for manifestation of God that we can access connect with is that name the sound the sound you this is not Material there are positive sounds uplifting sounds of affirmations in this world and there's of course - sounds and gossiping criticism but this is actually transcended and you met this guy
point about the most readily available through contemplation but it's also through readily available through practice just doing it like if you're having a crappy day you just sit down and add Transit Dental sound just a few moments and that's why there's so much emphasis on Joppa and some other people fight it can't get into it is to enjoy it difficult to hate whatever
 a restricted diet or I hate jogging but I know it's good for me or stuff like that yeah you got to work through this
 through that goes steps where it's a burden and then he feel like it without my morning run so so not only is that sound of Chris's name spiritual energy
it is Krishna that said you're so the whole it this is the verse the Holy Name Of Christmas transcendental a blissful are by Nature it is bliss right it bestows all spiritual benedictions there's nothing lacking in it in any way it can give you everything it will give you everything for it is Chris to himself the reservoir ball pleasure Chris's name is complete
 and it is a form of all transcendental Mellows mellow in other words alright album so many ways and blends of ways that one can love
 sure and that it in Krishna can be loved in all of those ways
 and this name
 this name is composed of all of those smell in other words
it is a form of all of those melo's all of those types of love over there in that name it is not a material name under any condition
 and it is no less powerful than Krishna himself
 since the name is not contaminated it's not corrupted in any way by the material qualities temporary temporarily to your misery or depression or there's no question of its being involved with Maya with the illusory energy it's it's not of this world is completely entirely spiritual Christians name is always liberated in spiritual deliver it is not
 like another words we call that thing a piano now but you come back a million years from now they're not going to call it a piano anymore it may not even exist the piano right but Christians name it is it's not conditioned by the laws material nature is eternally Krishna this is because the name of Krishna Krishna myself or identical so what happened
think about that, play Return to keep reading these books think about it again you know and for 2 to begin to become you begin to see it in new ways and I understand it more deeply and that's something that could go deeper and deeper and deeper I change your name as soon as squirrel this is exact subjects are you stopping squirrels are going to even play the piano will be driving down the road and you see some Amish guy in a horse cart like what the hell are they doing about those would like the harpsichord is practically gone to look at this box on the seat today she's like what's that box I was like you know I bought my son record player cuz he why had rolled
records of people that I want him to listen to my old records and stuff like that you want him to listen to you're only about 20 minutes because the ideas like who would go through all this just to listen to music like Alice higher quality sound apps you open up roadmap and it's like it doesn't tell you where to go you got to figure all that stuff out yourself there going to be a very much against what you're saying right now they're going to be the vinyl and it's the old generation people but the new generation people like this is archaic I'm actually looking at a map to try to figure out where you stay at the house in St Pete I got a first get a map of how to get to st. Pete then I got to go to st. Pete map come on
I love when people try to give you their address to take a right here take a left here to tell me these things I'm going to write this job this down the back of the envelope so you know I haven't had a job as a license since like 2008 or something so like I'm kind of a pre GPS person interested right now if you live in the sky do you know what that is like Thomas guide no idea oh my God everybody know I had a big fat book of the streets of Los Angeles logo don't say that getting back to the question was is Christmas love inherent in the sound of the muncher or the purity of Our intention in one sense is Christmas love and hair in the sound of the muncher I don't think he's asking the question this way but the first point want to make his will yes cuz it is Krishna
krishna's love
 is there you you access Christmas love by chanting his name that's it's there but I think what he's I think the question is like you were saying originally wrote or not that if I chant that name
 is Christian's lover is Christian a surly there and in the point that show about the setanta sarswati tacos making was just the syllables themselves can be material that they can be of this of this world on him but it's not having a
 yeah and even that I mean there's a whole signs to this name but yeah but but here it here's the point I want to make those what shows about kissing at the stars by the taco was saying was that
 this from the spiritual Realm
 once heart becomes moved towards Krishna becomes
affectionate towards Krishna and then when the name comes from there from that heart
 it comes out through the tulips in the in the mouth then that is that is Krishna it's not different from Christian when you hear that name you are you are accessing Christian you can make it happen yourself so so this gets back to the previous question reset can other meditative practices enhance our job or do they distract us from the main thing absolutely
 all these other meditative practices can enhance your job, particularly here in Christians Lila's hearing hearing about Christmas Past and reading Bob the time reading Ted cancel Bobbitt on what we Day ideas that through that through accessing that spiritual energy that is also known different from Krishna you know it's like this this verse said let's think about this right it said that since Christian's name is not contaminated by material qualities Christians
always liberated and spiritual right its meaning is free from the defects of the material energy the lower energy that me and said it's Eternal it does not affect my time like like friend since you take a book you take the book the show me about time in the book form right
 now I could hold that up and say rug enough this book right here is entirely spiritual and you might say what are you talkin about it it looks like material energy to meet material energy means that it's in one for now in in over the course of time that form shifts in and and that the ingredients separate is reducible and you're not understanding what I'm talking about because it's like if if I held up be here now
 or not in a lot. Notice if you're thinking of them but you're not Eat Pray Love You But I love that stood on the be here and I will be here now
debatable Eat Pray Love or even worse than cuz I do go to an ashram in Eat Pray Love this part of the title if a love for me is still firmly within the material realm books if you want to take something else that's a donkey holding or something I don't know. Let's keep it real Monday in okay
 Moby Dick house that Moby Dick is very deep straighten okay could copy of Sports Illustrated right now swim suit issue is it's it's not only that that copy of Sports Illustrated like that the magazine itself over the course of time is going to disintegrate but the mess
is within that magazine the meaning of it was conveyed through it all of that's going to disappear too it'll be gone right you know you come back you know a thousand years Ten Thousand Years a hundred thousand years from now everything that that magazine conveyed
 we'll have it would like a Mist it'll just be gone I will be Untouchable whereas when you hold of the Bob with Tom granted the ingredients of the form of the book are going to separate the reducible
 but the message of the Baba time is eternal that's what when I'm holding up the book and I'm saying this is a truck that's what I'm talkin about it's krishna's Lila's they they they exist eternally they they they never disappear and so you bring that spiritual energy into your heart by reading Bob and Tom that's that's a meditative practice and when you hold that in your heart now when you chant that name you're not
you just with your mouth to chatting with your heart
 and now and now you're chanting Christians name for real not just the syllables but the actual name just like the book is one thing
 and Christmas another the name is one thing right that the syllables of the name or one thing
 and Krishna is another
 you with me did you get that your family looking for you
 so the point is those syllables when you chant and it can be a Christian is conveyed through them and when we chant them from the heart will be chanting with love and affection for Krishna it's it's we are most powerfully transformed through that
 slps please Reeboks Henry person's legal said that will enhance your job but if you're if you're like I change the job is really boring it's because your heart isn't full of affection for Krishna like like when you say the
tarun or someone says the name to run to you your son's name it touches your heart in a way that it would not touch the heart of someone who doesn't have a relationship with him the way that you do that doesn't hold love because you hold love in your heart for him when someone says the name to ruin your heart was
 I have a feeling and so simply by reading Bob the time we we fall in love with Christian when we get it and it's dry it feels dry to us
 is because we have no love for Christian the heart and we can and we can nurse that love through here and babita
 I'm going to add two things to your statements them about your cheer points which were very insightful and insightful for myself. Just like for the audience out there but one is and you may not agree with this remain out of done it but I do like this morning I should probably before I Channel John mr. fancy
was it a secret running out sometimes I got too much stuff going on in my mind and say Lies coming coming down settle it down and then invite Krishna Radha Krishna to your heart to such as to sell the mine but it's also creating that was for a ride and Crystal want to enter
 I don't know the printing on my used to it's been a long time I'll teach you my I'll be I'll be your Guru if you like
 that's the snorting cocaine movies don't text that one anyway other thing I wanted to say was yeah and devotees you know where deal material
but the material realm its it can flick back and forth back and forth back and forth the devotees become the Alchemists We Touch matter and engage matter back in service of God and then that matter becomes spirit is the sound how we Tampa sound we were using this things that appear like matter material Sound Vibrations but it's actually spiritual potency but taking material things and using them like a flowers material he can find those elements of a flower and the orsay
 words right you can like like again we have like the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue and you could beat that kid that could bring lust in the heart but then you have this in my bag of Akita which should make you uncover your deepest spiritual self liberate you from the body mind
chances you take a harmonium which is nothing but matter but you can sing songs and then harmonious and use that all of a sudden that box that piece of wood becomes spiritualize the yoga studio if your yoga teacher in a strip mall doesn't have to be but if you're using that yoga studio to have transited the sound coming out of your mouth the sounds are coming out of your mouth or transforming that place into an ostrich have largely taken shelter from honey imma when you do your part and you sit up nice and straight back to eating in front of your altar right is that what you do it truthfully
 are you kidding that's like a yogi sitting around a circle of Fire
come on. Burning Ring of Fire chocolate body okay
 next question hitting on Miss Mara where did you do with these questions
 okay this is from Danielle she's one of our regulars Zoomers you want to be regular Schumer you can be what you need
 your email Mary wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com she'll send you the codes to enter our spiritual Clubhouse every morning
 they were hard to track down cuz we travel a lot but we have a special threads that go out and tell you okay today was Shifting the time okay Daniel says basic question how do you understand the meaning of taking shelter in Radha Radha and Krishna what does it mean to quote take shelter and how does one take shelter also what does serving Krishna look like in the spiritual world
is a great questions today a great question when the first part of that quick
 here's how you don't take shelter Krishna how about that will start with the opposite
 things are going to happen my life I lost a bunch of money it looks like I'm getting audited I hold back taxes my lost a shoe while on a hike different things are going to run away from home but get you so frustrated and feel so much emotional pain that I want to meditate that painting with a pain to go away and I use something like drugs or alcohol or marijuana to deaden the pain so I don't have to feel any longer that's how we don't take shelter until we take shelter of a drug or alcohol
Etc is romance to it like life is miserable but you can make my life
 it's so many ways we can not face what's going on in this world
 but real spiritual path makes us except
 that we can't stick your head in the sand fix spiritual pass it and we're doing it wrong we think I'm just going to stick my head in. Loves me I'm going to be okay now you got two actual face off your demons you got to control your sense as you got to see yourself as a spiritual being and you got to act in that way there's a lot of regulation of the senses in the mind which one to take shelter of the mundane and to take shelter broad Krishna in those times of stress those times are the sinkholes of human existence that we go through but that then we turn to Krishna Krishna and it might mean I'm going to sit here
and meditate on krishna's name it might mean I'm going to read the bottom of Tom it might mean I'm not going to zone out and just you know we all have a go to type of okay this is downtime
 what Krishna be your downtime go to Krishna talk to Krishna pray to Krishna speak to Christian like a friend and it's throw your hands up in the air. What would you like for me Krishna
 how can I how can I serve you this is practical ways of taking shelter Krishna Pooja which sancheti prayers to Krishna and it before the show started chanting japa anyways your meditation is this body is krishna's body I got to take care of it like your cleaning a temple
took my three minute freezing cold shower today but I was doing it for Krishna
 I'm not sure if he enjoyed it or not
 Krishna care so I can be a better servant so I can be sharp on this podcast do it you like it you do it now
 right to it after the show you promised me maybe tomorrow morning
 okay you want to go on with that with it what's your take on the way to go on a long time with this question because it's very good question what does it mean to take shelter Chris because we throw these terms around but it's it's important that's part of why I like this question because it's kind of like you know what I've heard this many times and and my Tennessee just had like nod and say Yes is nothing what is that mean
that's good that's a good question cuz I really mean what does it mean so you know when we could go into so many places in our shastra sin our sacred texts to dress this but I think maybe the the first place that came to my mind was 9 chapter the teacher my mother about my mind back to a muddy as you know I'm too muscular oh no no not before that is there there there there couple versus two or three verses with talks about people taken shelter with contrasting shelters write the word puta in like a Sharia Usher AMA I believe all these words are connected right like what is an ashram it's a shelter
 shelter means like there's something that I need protection from the something that I some Refuge that I find where do I go where do I put my refuge where do I find my refuge and so if we go to text.
12 of chapter 9 in the bug of agita cyst interesting verse Moga, Moga my eyes of the world are filled bread Moga Moga ji-hoon Kim mohenic versus the same property mohanam Streator that they are taking shelter of the mean struggle illusion or even like the ultimate right like they are totally go older and property in Mohegan that means bewildered by the material energy and momentum should have they taken shelter they taken Refuge
 in the diluting material energy
assistance taking shelter of an illusion yes nnn dimensions three ways that that that that illusion that where that fails one it says Moka Akashiya baffled in their hopes mocha caramel they're baffled in their their Works in this world where they can otherwise I'm sure they're baffled or they think they have a plan for happiness Drew Good Karma right like I'm that means I'm taking Shelton essentially the question is where will I find my happiness right where will I how will I avoid misery and find happiness and wherever I look for that that's what I'm taking shelter and that's why I taken refuge in
 do some people like the veek Army's Army so that means that they have no knowledge or faith place in any
sacred texts or any teaching like that they think the goal of life is I'll find happiness just through Reckless Center education without any direction so they're placing their they're taking shelter of the connection of their senses with the material energy that they're taking shelter in the polluting material into diluting material energy that's their shelter I'm going to find my refuge there then then you didn't you do it says this was an interesting mulga Carmona baffled in there fruit of activities even even if I'm a car may not even be coming from Carmen I'm saying like The Vedas give me directions on how to do how to call to make good karma through Behavior through ritual through sacrifice excetera then I'm placing my ref I'm taking Refuge
 and in this material energy again this material energy will deliver
 my happiness and my my
Be My Shelter
 and then it says mulga Ghana there they're baffled in their knowledge right they're baffled and in their hopes the back in a woman says in there Guiana it means even if they're seeking like mugshot rubiana through Annunciation you know knowledge comes with renunciation I let go of the things of this world and I'm thinking that's my refuge I'll find Refuge there I find I'll take shelter that but it has sent it sent by the power of my yoga or by the power of my renunciation I'll find peace and I'll try and send this this world
 a Christmas saying they become baffled and all of those none of them ultimately work and they seem like they're working for some time
 and then it doesn't work so these people are being diluted that's the idea then the next person very famous One
 another one until many counter counters this one Give me the give me a hint
if I give you a hand you again give me one word how about one syllable
 congrats, that's all you're going to give me no no no no no
 Muhammad Muhammad asked him a te there you go next line
 I'm a nasty Man part 2 Gianna but no no no end of the previous versus property on Mohican I'm sure to take a shower today take shelter of the diluting material energy this one says Mahatma house or the Bahamas be up most of the Great Soul Mahatma time to Mom part to dive in proper to measure to the divey property the spiritual energy right
higher Godly spiritual Divine energy
 diving property Market are they take shelter that Divine energy so that means in other words they're not thinking you know what I'm going to find my refuge in life I'm going to find happiness I'm going to find Freedom from suffering and miseries to my yoga prowess through my renunciation through enjoying this material world I want to build a big house I'm going to arrange the material energy so that I'll have a shelter I'm going to get the right job that'll give me shelter from suffering and I'll give me happiness in life I'm going to marry the right person that'll give me shelter from so I'm thinking I'm trying to take shelter in all these different ways and then again when it comes to the Savory to I could do it through through renunciation I have the as a powerful Yohe I will liberate myself from this material energy Christmas saying none of those work but the great Souls the mahatma's they take shelter in the spiritual energy what does that look like and and he begins to describe that
Junction an adjunct yin and yang Manis so they worship me with on deviated Minds
 right they've lost interest in the things of this world are mine goes to me the alpha who taught him of Liam knowing me
 to be the origin of all beings and imperishable right this is like a worthy shelter this will work set the time curity 12-month how does it manifest to always changing my glorious
 a tongue test charger of retarded friend ever in their devotion with great determination
 name a scientist German Bhatia at Namaste you're offering their loving with bhakti to me there are others are offering their Namaste with love in their hearts to me
 nature and this is this is this is the conclusion of the description what is it what is it look like taking that shelter in it you looked opacity through this devotion need to look at their always connected to right that I'm at
yeah I'm on I'm moving through this world with your yoga and never Adam and any moment am I disconnected
 just like a leaf if at any moment becomes disconnected from the tree it just dries up it dries up but if it's always connected it's always nursed It's Always vitalize by connection to the route
 and So Christine it to York to positive because it taken shelter in me they're always vitalize they're always spiritually by like they're not bewilder they're not all their hopes in a little and all that is not bewilder rather rather it's realized through this eternal connection it to yoga
 so so you know in one sense I think the answer to the question goes right there to the junction on your money so they worship me with undeviating Minds ride like this is kind of what it it alternate looks like their minds aren't
next to find happiness here and pick up my happiness there maybe I need this you know what that didn't deliver maybe I need this I'm interested in that I'm interested in that know they cuz they kind of it it's all right here right it is all right here I can just through Bob with time to bug of agita to buy getting to that route and then it's it is and it's some multifarious beautiful manifestations that are all part of that one
 everything I need is there I place my faith in and I have faith that by living that life
 you know I have faith that by giving myself wholly to 22 that original source to that root of all existence whatever I need will be provided for me you know it doesn't it also says that the Endeavor with great determination but but the idea is that the results are always given to me by God
 and so all I do
I do what I do what's right and Devotion to God and I let God take care of me that's taking shelter of Radha and Krishna You Know You Are My Shelter. I have no other shelter you know whatever shelter I seen this world is provided by you and I accept it and that's this is kind of like this is the
 how that manifests made look different in your life than in my life and it's someone else's life
 but the devotion that stares the same right ultimately everything is up to Krishna ultimately I belong to Krishna ultimately Krista is my shelter my protection from this that the the miseries of this world has hands it's not something that I'm going to go out and do independently it's something that's going to manifest through my giving my life entirely and that made manifest by living in a mansion made manifest by living in a hot but both
are feeling the same internal thing Christmas my my everything like that that's some like that it was something beautiful and that's a good idea for you to positive always connected to the word you Olga come soon as you look to you like the word the
 the English word yoke which means like if you have someone to join here like a yolk is like like if you have like a team of oxen or something like that and you want them to pull a cart or something then they wouldn't thing that connects their next together that's the yolk that's the okay yeah and so yoga country that because of me connecting two things that you answer this initiative is we are always connected yoked your that root of all existence just as a leaf again is is yoked to the plant and therefore through the plant to the route
 weak this is It's a simple as this
we can you start off by saying sorcerer or sorceress become a sorcerer has a team means I never disconnected and it is in what sense you know it won't sense this whole idea of like what does it mean to take shelter of radha-krishna it just means that we acknowledge
 the truth just confirm the truth
 as opposed to living a delusion that we confirm the truth that I am dependent on the route of existence at every moment right I recognize that I appreciate that and we're not worried about it cuz my life is getting mine hands and the Divine hands is a benevolent energy force being dies right if we're on the tree and it was saying I don't need the root of this plant 350 I'm independent I'm on my own
it's like no you're not even even in your saying that are as as you say that you're being nursed by the root of the tree you don't exist without the retreat and it is the more you try to deny that the more you suffer like it's the stupid as to say I'm I'm fully taken Shelter Rock enough that could be a problem. I've got nothing in the refrigerator it has he got out that you're fully taking a shelter of Krishna there's a you understand like even in those tough times that benevolent energy of Krishna has a greater plan bigger than I can see we are we are we become as ridiculous as diluted
 as a leaf that's it's just like I'm sometimes kids with her
 sometimes kids with their parents I don't need my parents I'm out of here
like you say like okay how are you getting out here I want to drive away in the car if you mean the car that I bought in provided for you if you need but that I'm paying the shirt insurance and I really don't want to get into like a gender battle kind of thing here but it's kind of like
 you know there are there really important ways of feminism has played a role in society and their ways were gone off track in my humble opinion on feminists please don't cancel me if it's sometimes like you see these things were like they're interviewing women and they say you know like we don't need men we don't need men for anyting you know it's kind of like okay but you know men have the house if you live in Building they designed it is well you know the car that you drive that was a man that built that and designed it is well an event it is well you know like in others in an insane is my point is we are we cooperate you know we serve each other we are complementary
but if we deny never seen a woman build a house either right now if we sit here and we say I don't need God for anything right but everything that you have is maintained by that Source you're just you're just like a bewildered child that say I don't need my parents but your parents mean while providing everything for you everything that we have our body our mind our even our existence is dependent on that route is maintained by that route so taking shelter that just means acknowledging what's true all along it in in feeling you know and so in the end that will when one understands that deeply you naturally take shelter you naturally feel that shelter
