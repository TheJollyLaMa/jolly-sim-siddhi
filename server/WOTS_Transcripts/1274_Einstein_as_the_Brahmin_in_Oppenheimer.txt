 hello. Hello.

back thank you recognize what's it like to be back it was hard to do the show without you you know we enjoy while it was a good things were falling apart it was a disaster it was a people were fighting there was a riot in the zoom bored but we're glad you got to kind of lose it to there was crying at certain points Doyle and I was pissed fighting is horrible thank God you're back 911 thank you happy to be back
 ice is so nice to be back in New York and I had to I was going 4-5 months unbelievable it seems like yesterday I mean it's a chunk of your life you know five months of the trunk it's something you're going to remember be to mine for 5 months I'm ready to dig in we got in yesterday but we stayed up late and talk and I have to have to start waking up at 4 so now I'm like I got to practice going to bed at you know
are one just to do these performances and wake up and sure enough such a suit is down here you're chanting kind of sitting sandwich at Chuck-E-Cheese I was like you know what it's like it's like time has stopped and hear me it's such a suit to chanting on the floor like we did 36 years ago it's nice it is nice it's nice when you have friends like you and Sachi apartment end up being a weeping devotees for so many years and matter all the ups and downs that have happened with life and all the you know wonderful things heart breaks everything you still just change them at Holy Name
 you're a good good you know we had such a suit on the show but I think was before before was the podcast it is he I was when we were supercell sacred Sangha there was bring one tomorrow and if you are 39 or even to do a major you know Sunday interview with them
 yeah
yeah we focus guy I came home I found this lovely sweatshirt waiting there for me they usually send things to me and then I decide if I'm going to give them to you or not somehow that slipped through my fingers. Around that but it was it is there is to grab my camera my phone's in the kitchen I'll find it I can't find that name is I want to thank them but they have I tell you I get nothing but stopped on the streets with my Black Flag by Black Flag Hari Krishna a t-shirt that might be one of the best ones ever Black Flag Harry Krishna hoodie or a windbreaker and crew neck
 all right so are we got to go back in the box with Tom are we been at we've been at it for boo
Brentford versus Burning through these versus they're not easy versus you know all teachings we have a nugget today sir you know this isn't right. I was your the Nugget your life is going to have nothing but you know I am
 sometimes in the past when you jump on airplane kind of like your standards go out there and you know it's kind of like this is just mean and dumb stuff you know you sat there watching some fortunately I fly Air India and the TV screens don't work so he didn't we just had to hear a champion Tire 14 hours but you know I'm kind of more determined not to go there but I did watch one film
 and I was up at
tell me you haven't seen her yet I haven't seen it but we know Oppenheimer to be the one who created the nuclear bomb right he led the Manhattan Project we've been had a project atom bomb enough they built where I lived in West Beth will that was one there if there are five places where they had scientists working together
 and involvement in the butt finding case song
 yeah and then he created this place out in the middle of Los Alamos out in the middle of New Mexico I think it is
 and you know he he he was the scientist that was kind of in power to build the team and lead the team and
 you know I knew it had a bug of agita connection course cuz you call
the bug of agita
 you know after I think the first test you know the first test of the bomb sure and it's what you do for that reason I want to see it but I suppose there was a lot of analyze in this film lot of interesting stuff the famous horse was Carlos when he looks like a creeper every 20 time I am the great destroyer and I've come to destroy all the world yeah it's quoted a little different he quoted a little different I know what translation he had didn't have a bug of agita as it is. I am death that something like that but but it occasionally here's the thing here's what I was analyzing was watching it
 is it first so let me just say it was a very well-written directed act I mean it was very well done film
who's all in all in one sense there's no real action but it felt very fast paced but in very intellectual and very fast-paced at the same time it was
 it was just kind of purely you know just judging it on its own merits as a film I mean it was it without its message or whatever that it wasn't her it sounds boring great cuz I don't want something but you know it's dealing with Oppenheimer who's like you know obviously like a genius and the well-intentioned man but he hears the point he's struggling with his tremendous weight of a historically consequential ethical dilemma you know like we know we all have ethical dilemmas in life but how many of our ethical dilemmas you know the survival of the world is depending on it you know.
 And and so that was you know he was already at least the way that was portrayed in the film already kind of like a
work is the right word but you know like you know he's a scientist Super Genius scientist is a bit quirky but now he has to deal with this and hired to build a bomb that can destroy the world yes and for the Nations protection you know how to stop diarrhea and nausea to go to the ideas what if Hitler gets this thing first you know then then we're really in trouble so we must develop it or you know at a certain point when after Germany surrendered they're still at the Japanese and it's kind of like this war will go on forever and far more people will die if we don't use this one
 so now we're doing it to save lives right up and and so now you're struggling with that but meanwhile he's eating the hose
 that he's thinking he's struggling with the idea of the
suffering this involved in a massive destruction and human suffering this involved in what it might mean for the future of the world and even that's not a smart bomb it's not like you're going up right it's going to land on Hitler's lap you're going to kill so many civilians it's designed to be collateral damage that is this is this really you know how ethical is this whole thing in beyond that even up until the moment was moment after they tested the first atomic bomb they weren't entirely sure that it was going to set off a chain reaction that just involve the entire Earth sure they don't know it's didn't realize it's power the chain-reaction that's necessary to create it
 they didn't know if that chain reaction was going to come to an end or not in other words is going to be a big explosion is going to be an explosion that just extends unlimited lie and just swallow the whole Earth
oh really I didn't I mean they were about nuclear bombs are kind of like yeah you know 99% chance that won't happen but maybe right
 but but here's the thing if it was that dumb as I was watching it just trying to do viewing it through the lens of all the shastra that I read you read Mahabharata you read by what time you read it you know I promised there were almost
 entirely no Brahmin is in this film or if there were brahmanism would have the scientists themselves they were like the intellectuals
 but they were in an In-N-Out he had this whole range of these brilliant scientist in each one with their own kind of own personal idiosyncrasies and Android on which was an interesting you know part of the film with a Brahmin has but we're compromised because they're working for people who had that's exactly the point
what do we call them you could say there, my Sim in my mind the way that I saw it in the film was they were the intellectuals but they were engaged in the service of the politicians and the that you can see the chart region of the politicians in the Army the military
 rather than the other way around I like that is kind of upside down from The Vedic perspective in perspective is the intellectuals
 the contemplatively wise ones
 they hold power over the the military and in the in the rulers
 you know we're here was they became the Servants of the rulers and they were pressured and intimidated and so on by those rulers
 and and do that there's kind of like this there was no adult in the room
 it was kind of like this blind raced towards
 destruction you know it and they kind of real
I said it wasn't I don't know if it was
 I can't remember who the character in the film was amazing Oppenheimer it may have even been Einstein or I don't think it was nice time but at one point they said you know it's not like we've created it's not like this is a new weapon
 that we have to contend with because a big part of the scene of the film was hit he's going through this ethical struggle
 and then he feels the responsibilities you communicate with the president over the the massive
 consequences of his creation as he's going through it from his perspective you thinking so much about it everyday for years you're working to create this thing it's it's it's fully absorbing your mind and you are thinking about the consequences of it was just like a a president or military official that's just things that we need it now
 you know so when he finally did kriti felt the need to
speak to the president into the government into the L
 about that it wasn't just that we just create a new weapon we just entered a new world like you better than new world now
 and you don't put it there was one Brahman in the film it was Einstein and you can pick it up even like even the way that he's portrayed like he's he's always shown like natural settings like he's out by a pond out in a few holes you know it's like in the me to approach me Affleck walk along distant you know you even visual right it was convey that he was somewhat removed from the world he was a generation older than this team of scientists have a working on the Manhattan Project his work
 I suppose made it possible you know like not that he was directly involved in developing it that with the bomb but the research said he had
it is the work that they were doing with stemming from his work and so he's kind of like Shake again he's showing like these Natural Science and when Oppenheimer has a pressing question he has to go to the Wise One in a sense you know like is there someone here who ethically I really trust who has who really understands
 what's going on
 and so he would approach him and then when Einstein would speak you know he's if you count the minutes that he's in the film it's like very small
 but the weight of his presence in the film is is kind of is waiting for you know you feel his presence in the film over
 and when he speaks he doesn't waste words he kind of looks like a very nice that was working for the project he was just the Oppenheimer we consulted with him on the other side of Einstein a lot of people like when they they speak about him is getting being involved in Manhattan party he wasn't directly involved
his research that he did that they're their work stand off of his research
 but that stuff you done years before and what he did write a lighted sign a letter that a group of scientists have written to the president to say that we better developed this cuz the Germans are working on it
 I'm so not since he was involved but you never directly works on the bun but when he when he speaks in the film
 he speaks as a promise because like he's got this to steal the central thought you know he doesn't waste words or just say what he was concerned with the lasting effects of project
 oh you do acid and that's in contrast a lot of the other characters who were like they were they had this fear base thought and there was this urgency to produce it now you know like Matt Damon plays the role of of this song Lieutenant General whose car
the military man overseeing the project and he's got two concerns one is security that this doesn't leak to the enemy right and in it what is that was almost all of these intellectual scientist almost all had left leanings and we're involved in the Communist Party you either Loosely or not so loosely it you know at some point in their careers at least quite a few of the more
 so that was very complicated and but there was also Truman you know who's like the president after the war more I guess towards the end of the war and there's a scene where after the
 after the end of the war
 Oppenheimer feels the need to communicate with the president and to communicate publicly his concerns for entering this nuclear age
 and he feels a personal sense of responsibility for
and I don't ever call the second part of movie but like the end of the movie it deals with the government actively trying to discredit him and paint him as a communist
 because he's speaking although his speaking truth he speaking
 well, compassionate well reasons truth
 but it's not convenient for them
 sure and so they try to discredit him by now painting him as a communist
 but when you have when you hear it so when he finally just people Truman after the bombs already been dropped he's like he's very emotional and he saying you know I feel like I have blood on my hands in the first room is like hey can you know what's it's an honor to have you here in a few did so much for the country and then he starts saying you know while I feel like I have blood on my hands and in Truman in the way that I don't know if he was like life what happened but the way they
portrayed in films he's very callous crude and how he responds where he says you know you think anybody is even think about you the guy that made the bomb is the guy that dropped the bomb that they carry next mean I got to get out of any kind of kicked him out of the room and says don't let that cry-baby back in here again like that in a fellow in any case you know I'm Stein does kind of play this role he's concerned with the lasting effects he's his thought is because he's detached and is removed in a sense he's obviously deeply intellectual thoughtful man he is the person that Oppenheimer can go to to hear Truth where is kind of not really available anywhere else you know it's not he's not going to get that from the lieutenant general in the Army who's kind of overseeing his project yeah he's not necessarily going to get that from the other scientists who were all caught up in the Earth
sea of the moment as well as their own reputations of scientists and their own Petty conflicts that they have monks themselves and Stella
 he's not going to get that even if you do from his real all the characters their bility too deeply involved truth and their freedom to communicate without fear of consequences there almost Einstein is the one who kind of is has placed a medical roll your take away as we need a lot of we need Brahmin Sweeney people are the gaps and can speak truth without being compromised without working for people with agendas and we have to like value that position so we can go to them that's that has to be instilled in the people to value that for to value that in the highest
 or else you get the second-tier people who just say all who write them off or imprison them or in discredit
are or are deaf to their instruction you know you said second or Joey probably would say forth to your house. I would say it's actually they're all students in this meaning they haven't been well trained and they haven't imbibe their sense of responsibility to serve others and watching some car me movies to get in a car me any Car Midway well I'll tell you something I wrote it on a friend of a friend of mine invited me for lunch before I left a very nice devotee lady named Sarah and she had a friend named a daughter who I knew from the I don't know if you remember that's what he did. Her was French way back in RV I-80 days in the early 90s
 if you saw him I think you would
daughter any case they may just right there such sweet people in this woman she's like Italian and it was Sarah
 and she just loves to cook for a divorce and so my friend brought me over there
 and he said what do you want you want Italian food what do you want just tell me what you want she'll make it cuz I really am and you know she made raviolis in when she made pizza with a ton of a rule on top which I've never had I've heard about it was really nice McElroy's Sally's on the shell right now he's like oh yeah they always go to Italian as the default and and then also his ravioli it was amazing just like a huge raviolis you know so I have this incredible launched just before I left and then she made me these sandwiches that were really delicious I understand that you that you were protected on the plane with good beat.

 I was born in the darkness of ignorance of a teacher to open my eyes with the torch out of knowledge base and sees at their Lotus feet by Barbra Tom Canto 7 chapter 6 x 16
 no speaking regular robot is teaching his
demoniac school friends and he's teaching him like he's not like teaching them know about how to play stickball or Cricket he's laying on the heaviest truths the absolute truth right to his these kids and they're like Okay I accept this
 text 16 is right in par with that went diamond please
 all my friends sons of demons in this material world even those who are apparently advanced in education right and we have Oppenheimer advancing education all the other people working on this team
 apparently advanced in education have the propensity to consider this is mine and that is for others okay that's the world of Duality a separatist conception and their separate from us thus they're always engage
and providing the necessities of life to their families in a limited conception of family life just like uneducated cats and dogs
 right to the end they are unable to take two spiritual knowledge instead they're bewildered and overcome by ignorance and we were talking about this yesterday while you were a witness in the truck I listen to cab it's like even as I'm getting older too I'm seeing like
 I'm forced to see their people in my life
 both Elders people are my age and like children that are moving on their spiritual journey and they've almost become like family to me
 and then there's people that could intimately be your blood relatives
 medicine that are so distant like how do we get bored in the same same family you know and
 and sometimes even to
I don't know it sounds a little harsh but almost something so much that even like support them you feel like you're supporting something
 evil dark and evil and like what are you going to do with this I'm giving you are you going to use for something good or you just going to use it and we talked about King to have their who are like being very gracious or parents were very gracious we were talking about the guy shajahan from the Taj Mahal a charity to his children that is 14 year old son who wasn't the eldest son murdered all his brothers and sisters so he can take his father
 It's just sometimes you know we think we're being in a gracious and these people actually take advantage and they all we are saying that they don't know how to deal with the energy and we're saying that energy could be well it could also be Beauty it could also be Fame
but they're all energies are opulence has like we get this idea of the concept of God they call God Bhagavad mean one who has every opulence but fully to Christian that owns all wealth he's all beautiful he's all strong but he knows how to utilize those energies in the same way electrician knows how to work with heavy heavy electric voltage without without frying himself wears a child with a fork sick in the fork in the outlet could kill themselves so the devotee can take energy
 and not kill themselves with it but do incredible things with it and then we use another example of a devotee family is the love of a family back if those if all the abused is John to be Harrison's family
parents are like gurus and the kids are like practicing body kirtan leaders saintly and it can you use all that energy in a Divine Way then then that very thing which the bottom of time is not sure poking at the problems with family existence that thing is not like the silkworm which creates the Cocoon with traps himself in but actually you become a beautiful butterfly with in the family you know I was you know I've really been enjoying these Talks by
 ready for mine for boo I've been listening to him too many good ones and that it seems like he visits there once or twice a year and then they record them and they put them up
 as they've been really helpful what I last one that I listened to as listen to this in the airport for going to play
 it was all about the translation of she'll probably book said that the editing of prop Parts books
 and even the post room
how do you pronounce posthumus post hummus and Baba ghanouj but the controversy you know a lot of people very gainst it's all really it if you did if you don't know after proper prop bets made statements like that you know don't change a word out that I said and then editors changed why would you do that why would you change anything profound said not to and the others were like this was clearly not the proper word it was some people transcribed it within a probably well here's the thing I got the broadest Vision I've ever had it from his presentation was here because he's actually participated on a on a independent board that's where we were established to analyze the entire thing the entire history
 from the first you know original
how do I write it's through all the different editing send mainly there's been like there's three levels there's the first when they're first written and published by the original transcription which I added it then there is profit asked his editors to edit them when they're a lot of mistakes were parents right 72 at least the bug of agita came out again and 72
 and then it was done again in 83 I think
 but even before he gets into details of that he talks about the nature of editing in the nature of communicating and how would we hold a book in her hand where we kind of assumed that were connected directly to the to the author
 and that their thoughts are perfectly expressed here there they're genuine thoughts have been perfectly conveyed in this prison printed page but he begins to describe the
dorkly you no going back yuno to that you do you know how hard that is to accomplish when
 you Wednesday when you are author back in you know it in 1102 or even you didn't write that writing was actually the job of a scribe and then those scribes would write it and hopefully they're here drive from you and they wouldn't make mistakes and then other scribes so many other scribes would have to copy that work and then other scribes for to continue to be copying those works you know so but he was saying but even in modern-day with modern technology it's challenging and it's all kind of Sarasota he he really expressed how
 the need to edit isn't just based on like hair I think I can make this better it's like I want to try to make this more authentic I want to bring it to what the author intended and so he he he he he spoke really well about that
end in i feel much better informed than I ever have been on this subject but
 there you go in that you got the idea that
 this place is Broad
 and the messages are brought
 and often a speaker or a writer or presenter is emphasizing a particular point at a particular time to a particular audience that they feel is most important for them to understand
 where has at another time and another place to another audience they may still be speaking truth but he may even sound like it's contradictory even sound like it's an entirely different message but but really didn't so you know so is his family life good
bad right now in these verses like the ones that you were reading yesterday what car lot is doing is he saying hey kids
 our families are trying to indoctrinate us
 and they're trying to convince us that our family that the dyches the demons that we are good and others are bad that our welfare is what we should always look out for at the expense of others and that will find all our happiness within the range of these family units you know that's what they're trying to document so even here when he say all the sons of demons in this material even those who are apparently advancing education who's that who's he talked about their teachers are teachers are apparently the super you know we would come into the classroom or assuming that these teachers are advancing education and they're going to share that with us
 but you saying but even these people who have all this knowledge and all this
they're still caught up in this backward thinking that this is mine and this is for others and they're trying to indoctrinate us in that kind of thought you know other trying to convince us that all of our happiness will be found within our family right then what we need to be satisfied and happy and so is found within our family
 but I'm here to tell you that they don't know what they're talkin about actually their day and they haven't brought in their thinking and it's so warm yes we can read here we'll probably speaking he's he's highlighting let's put it that way
 he's hot is one message it's kind of like you had if you had a huge Blackboard and it had a well-balanced message written on the entire thing but you only have a spotlight so at any given moment you can only Spotlight a certain part of that brought Ruth right now Pilates shining his light
on that part of the truth that has to do with the dangers of of family relations
 you know how it now he could shine his light on another part of it and highlight something else sure but but here he stays highlighting that that danger part in the bar but I'm going to do that a lot because our Tennessee's to to try to find completeness and happiness through temporary relationships
 yeah we use that word yesterday insidious insidious it's going to be in the creeps up on you everything's fine everything's fine next thing you know you're completely off your spiritual trajectory the world works like a like a Riptide yes and so from the beginning of this talk this is one it's like a speech or pep talk of perla to his his friends and he started with that what is a kumara a trip
from the very hey hey guys friends were young right now we may think we got plenty of time to waste and spend and we can have fun and if you knows not be too concerned about where we're going and it actually this world is dangerous to be Troublesome it's a mess right now we should get really focused you know should really focus and any any is singing at is Insidious in would be there trying to indoctrinate us right now into a type of sectarian separatist type of thinking and we could see that that's it's really what rules that film
 you know what about Oppenheimer he was like you know
 American lives are the most important
 you know the course the Germans a team of the German lives in the most part in the rushes within the Russian lives in most important and we're all ready to grow not only ready
racing frantically to create a bomb that might even kill all of us sure that you know is going to get us out of a difficult position
 did the tremendous threat that if there is that it presents but there's every possibility that it's going to turn around right back at us and bring us into a very dangerous age you know said it is kind of highlighting what separatist thought leads to and it leads to fear that leads to Cruelty
 it leads to suffering not only for those that it's directed at but also for the one that possesses that type of thought and pallotta's he's thinking you know the Baba Thomas is never impractical in the sense that it's saying
 there should be no leader is saying we should all just you know
 just love one another and just so you know
don't need any government or military or any of these things it's never like going to that that's kind of like a swing of the pendulum right you know like okay right if we have Nations we have rulers than going to fight with each other and they're going to be suffering so there should be no Nations and their rulers Boggstown doesn't say that but what the bottles are saying is that we need to we need to
 we need to tap in to a higher level of thought even though we have these functional roles that we play in society and their important to maintain to establish peace in the welfare of others
 at the same time we always have to be connected with this broader truth
 that we are all made of the same spiritual energy that all life must be respected you know and that's going to come from those that are thinking Deeply One again when you go to Einstein he was never pictured
the offices he wasn't even pictured in the Laboratories he was always pictured outside under a tree you know by the side of a pond in an environment where you that that facilitates thinking deeply that's right you know it's like it's showing us that we need rulers but those rulers need to be I don't know if indoctrinated is the right word cuz it carries a kind of a negative connotation but they need to be inspired and expired but tethered by
 higher thinkers who don't struggle necessarily with the responsibilities that they struggle with
 Carlos that back into this at Seventeen and eighteen is a combined verse my dear friends are sons of demons it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of this
personality of godhead has been able to liberate himself from its real bondage at any time or in any country
 rather those breath of knowledge of the Lord are bound to the material laws are factually addicted to sense gratification and their target is this woman right or sent me to control other senses actually in particular sure indeed they are actually play things in the hands of attractive woman
 especially I guess it's about time speaking a lot of men and therefore it is saying that men are dominated by their passions and I think it's safe to say I I've seen or I've been in a position where I sort of like if we witnessed victimized by such a
conception of Life they become surrounded by children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and that's their Shackled to material bondage those were very much addicted to this conception of Life are called demon is calling it right at what it is if you're attached to your body as a vehicle for sense gratification and that's the goal of life that is the minds of a demon and you will be Shackled and Liberation you're going to find bondage it's not like cuz you're going to die and go to hell know your life becomes hell if you've ever been addicted to anything in a driven by your senses life becomes hell you don't have to wait for some to burn in hell that life on this planet becomes hell those were very much addicted to this conception web for called demons therefore although you are the sons of demons keep aloof from such persons and take shelter the Supreme person out of godhead and Ryan the origin of all the demigods because the ultimate goal for the devotees of daraya
is Liberation from the bondage of material existence so that this whole beginning of the versed speaks about
 you listen people could try it it's not working people been trying to get out of material bondage and how do they do it with no roadmap you can't figure out across an ocean or you know how to cross the country without a roadmap you just get there just so I know which way you go you usually you don't know which way to turn in your you driving around you might even be driving around a very very nice vehicle but we get sort of Lost in the same way people do certain things like OK Google born to this world there's no one with knowledge there's no Brahmin in my life so you hook up with people who seem like they're happy with this guy's got a lot of well or this person who has a lot of girlfriends or this person has some other types of success how can I be like them and then
we follow in their footsteps but we never really asked what the goal is where are they headed what's a homerun for them in their life and their choices and therefore their idea of becoming liberated and it's not just with material Pursuits if it's even sort of spiritual Pursuits like people like you I want to be spiritual how do you do that and it just becomes another example of blind leading the blind that's why I having someone who can direct you towards Liberation via the personality of godhead
 it is just like someone just laying out a map for us yeah do you know this is a lot here it's interesting he's playing a very revolutionary type of role like he saying there are higher powers that are trying to doctor Nate Us in the Nicolaitans that that's his five-year-old what's going on
school right here this is exactly what's going on that apparently well-educated people
 you don't understand deeper thinking compassionate thinking they're trying to they're trying to manipulate us and to continue their worldview to extend their worldview
 but their world view is faulty and the world release is suffering and we don't need to play a part in that
 but he's doing it and as you mentioned like the beginning that it was text 17 the first half of it it had to do with the Rarity of finding Liberation is the Rarity of of actually finding deep peace and satisfaction in life rather than being stuck in a cycle of ups and downs and you know varieties of so it's a rare thing in in his solution to it
 comes at the second part where he's
we need to be aloof from people that think that way we can't be controlled by people that think that we can't allow ourselves to become influenced by people that think that way there are people that want to become free from the bondage of the material world and so they say they do things like well I'm just going to quit with your I'm going to sell everything and go to live in a cabin this is what type of people or they have other ideas of what it means to be free and I'm not going to be in the workforce anymore I'm just going to backpack around the world and you can just see they get it they get the understand the problems with the grind but unless there's a fuse with spiritual life here they too become trapped in the another version of happiness I was just listening to something on Instagram founded attractive it sorta like you know I don't want to be around you know my perfect life I want to be in a cabin in the middle of nowhere having a 400 acres and just farm and and then what
and then what you really don't want you to want to be around anybody you don't want a community it's like they're I can understand their intention because the material world is filled with its complications of them's relation Noble complicated and I understand okay our food is contaminating our land is contaminating the politics are contaminated the news is contaminated and then what are you do you want to just be a Hermit you think that's the goal of life to be a Hermit and it was extending from what you're saying is I totally understand and that type of thought you know what in the world that we live in there's a lot of Truth in all that there's a lot of truth but you could also be out in the woods you know in just drinking beer hunting and could be in a better life than if you're in the city but it doesn't give you the Liberation I know in my own life if it wasn't for the bug of agita you know
 I-10
being passionate ignorance that's what that's my default that's my body is to fall passion ignorance so even if I thought ya want to go live in the countryside and build a simple Cottage and I'm in a lot of passion and anger is I will take the countryside and throw passion in my car and it would be a mess my house would be a mess just didn't know we got to raise our Consciousness higher and this is the beauty of the bug of agita Vader bidding system is it's not just like unplugging and disengaging for the material realm what do you know raising the entire consciousness-raising yourself through these lower Gunners to the higher gunas and then connected with the Lord that that's really important would you share dropping off his dad's
 even if we had even if we had good news and even if we had good food and then if we had good all the things that you listed you gave a whole list I don't remember that everything has become contaminated even if none of it was contaminated
what do you do with life but but but beyond that also when I'm picking up
 in in the character of perlot is that although he's playing the Super revolutionary role as a 5 year old
 and although he speaking truth to power
 eat first he's facing power and speaking truth to them whether it's his father or the teachers speaking truth to them in a revolutionary sounds like we will not be dominated by
 these darker forces we can stand up weekly you know we can stand up for ourselves and did not surrender to their to their ways and their manipulation he's so he's he's he is a full-on revolutionary but there's not a drop of animosity
 it's not in his tone he hasn't although he's spoken frankly and I mean frankly bluntly
Dairy truthfully about their elders
 and the the limitations of their
 understanding
 and problems with their
 thinking
 there's been no ad hominem attack here you know I mean although he says I mean he did say they are called demons pretty same because of their behavior they are now placed themselves in the category should hate them
 but he's saying we need to stand up and do the right thing we need to be engaged in the right way we need to think more clearly than they think and act based on that clear thinking and even though it's challenging this is something we must do what he hasn't there's been no anger in him there's been no animosity and most important has been no hatred in him which is common
you know Universal when it comes to the Revolutionary sure there is a slight on this type of thinking creates a demonic mentality which means you can have it to you can have it if you want it if you want to act like a demon is what demons do and demons are never satisfied they're never grounded and then never peaceful and so here you go this is the mindset of a demon is that this is a great to understand it's like the 16th chapter the bug of agita it points out take note here this is how demons behave is that a demoniac mentality is this is the thoughts of a demon and this is the thoughts of a devotee a person who is liberated people will not look into your own mind and heart yeah yeah exactly like sets the bar like what side of the fence do you want to do and sometimes when you read those descriptions of a demoniac
mentality you think I like that's sort of been me seen this this you know I'm a little bit leaning towards the demon side and I think that's important also because we can become whoever we want to be but it's nice to point out that these thoughts this Behavior this leaves the demoniac lifestyle and at least two dissatisfaction is that just like we hate you it's like you're causing bondage and people say things like this all the time like I was just no good or bad you didn't you just do whatever you want no there is a good or bad and they in the metric to measure what is bad is things that are kind you tighter to the body but not of the heart that has you tied her to the body to make you think that I'm a boy I'm a human I'm a male American parent but things are finally Consciousness they're going to make you suffer more
 and things that are liberating that you're
District salt that everybody says that every living being destroyed salt of the earth itself is a spirit so that every plant is a spirit Soul that's the information that liberates you that'll make you feel joyful connected W more peace in the world if you want peace in your life so it's not just condemning the bad guys the ogres the boogeyman is condemning the it's pointing out that the thought patterns of those leaning into the demoniac Philosophy for us for our benefit as we fall into the irony or the Paradox in it that that
 in the name of compassion
 we become uncompassionate and then you know in the name of compassion we become violently fully become full of violent hatred for
years ago I once heard a nugget from someone
 I don't even know who it was from exactly if some nugget collector are you it was I think it came from some some Swiss figure right or something like that
 everybody sent you what he said was if we really see the truth if we really understand the truth
 then we have two choices
 we have become a monk like either you walk away from the world but you know to find your own inner peace or you become a revolutionary you fight against it right
 and I've always thought that the path of bhakti for there's a gradation between the two for sure you know you could end up more on one side and more in the other but in a sense that offers opportunities to be both
 to to have the contemplatively end of the monk right to to think deeply about life
and develop attachment you know and find inner peace and at the same time become an instrument of change in the world in one word of the year your band that you going to go to show tonight yes and you know it's kind of like that's a band that has influenced people influence Minds influence Hearts I guess you can call me an influencer and and and those people that hear it they all have their lives
 and they you do not and then they're going to use that influence in some way that we we may not even be aware of and that's the second degree of influence you know and then whoever they contact is going to spread so it's so we all have that opportunity we can the bug of agita and and in the path of Bucky as we've learned it through sure the problem but I really do feel like it gives us a really really nice sweet spot
we do have the contemplation and Detachment of the of the renunciate of the monk but it also really encourages us to try to
 in a large way in a small way and some way
 react against it stand up against it fight against it but without the drawbacks because it has the contemplatively side without the drawbacks we're in our own inner world gets corrupted by hatred and its it can happen very easily in one sense applying the stuff to ourself we become the Monk and what you give it to somebody else you become the Revolutionary we go
