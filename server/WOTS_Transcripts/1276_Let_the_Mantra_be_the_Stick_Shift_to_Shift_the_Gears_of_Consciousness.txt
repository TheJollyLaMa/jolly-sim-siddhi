 something about people just bear in their soul you know it's just like yes yet it touches your heart and makes you want it it gives you permission to be honest and vulnerable by beautiful you weren't just a relishing the other people's shortcomings now and not at all made it may be looked at dig deep into mine and and
 spiritual life it's like we are asked
 280 E tablet
a line of cups wait up one line of cops is filled with poison one line of cups is filled with nectar and spiritual life means always choosing the nectar you know into the degree that we always choose the nectar experiencing spiritual life and to the degree that we nourishment agree with choose the poison me like falling off are falling off our track and
 you know it's when people can be honest about it and it and just not pretend they're drinking the nectar and just be honest about where they're at it it it's it's quite beautiful but I find that that's sort of like the key is to always make that right choice and I tied you to all the traveling I just feel like it it doesn't been sore the last day in Michigan I was just like I just felt like I was falling apart couldn't change the Joppa couldn't eat properly in a regulated time and regulation really helps with everything doesn't it we talked about this yeah
regular what I'm referring to sit down I know it does and I have to do a lot of traveling or this is but this Buck that's come out
 part of the part of my duties
 okay so Christy bow
 spiritual scientist oh really where is he Brooklyn Temple Brady popped into the Brooklyn Temple
 what are the memories in that place special it is only one other person in there afternoon so beautiful Radha Govinda so beautiful in that place it's like its exact same as it was in 1987
got a little magic in their butts all the paintings on the wall yeah they're not all there yeah they've been switched out a little bit you know that impression too came up to me and Maya poor and said
 rakkanoth we want shelter to play at the Brooklyn Temple
 and I noticed you have polio you know you can have to walk around on crutches you know if they have everything this pain in your body that have you ever walked around on crutches
 never my life horrible you think you know you go slow or slower hateful your hands hurt from holding those crutches right my hands and arms are so sore I'm putting the weight on the crutches my armpits very sore armpits and in yet he travels widely
Devil's wind traveling so hard normally what to do if you have to move around on crutches and everything but he does it to help people and it doesn't deserve and that he's got
 maybe the most analytical analytical brain I've ever encountered
 yeah and so we we were talking about we just we're going to just sit the you know like he and I were just like hook up every now and then we just talk you know like we were just bring a different subjects and talk
 so I wasn't sure what we're going to talk about he had some ideas but there's one thing I want to talk about was my book cuz there's one part where I'm struggling just with understand how the pieces fit together can I help it's okay he already held no but I said I said you would makes you laugh I said I said actually but dumb
but I said well you know I'm trying to show these different models of evolution is this model that you know that I can this way and this way I know I was having trouble figuring it out
 you know when it when something is too contrived it doesn't it doesn't work you know when you try to make peace has been where they don't fit yeah where you try to draw connections but it's a collection of the evolution of thought the evolution of a secret and they have a date you want boom boom he said it instantly if he thinks like this on a regular basis it just comes to like
 struggle with it it was just boom boom boom he immediately and as soon as he said that it was like the clouds disbursement of the that you just solved my problem and actually you just made
 anyway I have to sit and play with these ideas but I think he just kind of like he just gave me everything I needed to know nice
skip to the bill if he's around take advantage people go check them out yeah he'll be in New York this week I think he will be speaking at the bhakti center be speaking of Brooklyn Temple
 Aaron Aaron Aaron can just write a message board that he saw him in London since got to get back on the show soon yeah
 here's the Nugget I wasn't looking for my nugget but thank you for the Nugget program on 15th and 16th and San Francisco one that's not the Nugget but it is it's a nugget of great info type of nuggets yeah
 so if you're in that area
 be sure to put it when we're going to Nancy's going to figure out what I now see
Patriot members have access to Discord so here's the Nugget in this is Paul from Corinthians
 you say if it was from Corinthian Corinthians
 Paul writing his letter to the Corinthians do you know where Corinthia was
 Cynthia was near
 that's a good question
 no I don't I was about to speculate and then I realize you'd call me on call me being a Speculator so I could stay where was Corinth
 no that's that's what I'm asking you Siri on your Syria
 no I mean Grease Grease Grease Grease Grease
there's a thriving Trade Center but there's a lot of struggle for the early Christians there
 yeah that's in the hell they went through
 I don't think it became popular until the
 who was it Constantine the Roman Emperor
 that's when he popular I said it made it like the religion of the state but otherwise they were just too obscure Cult of sorts alt right it's all until the emperor accepts it and makes it mandatory the religion is one of the regional units of Greece part of the region of a little pony Sea Ponies around the city of Corinth in the northeastern part of the peloponnese peninsula can you say pull up in the east
okay here's what he had to say
 do you not know that you were home you know you not know that you are God's Temple and that God's spirit dwells in you
 do you not know that you are God's Temple and that God's spirit dwells in you
 yeah what are you going to do the temple
 what are we what are we doing it right or we littering in the temple urinating in the temple degrading the temple
 we got to polish the temple get a clean the temple you got to power wash the temple
 you know in what sense is this is a theological statement
yeah saying that there's God exists and God exists in you or you know sometimes you say within the body or I'd like the body is a temple here saying you are Temple what is the temple temple is what is looking at a temple I mean of course you have all kind of temples right like real simple ones or very ornate ones what is all the ornamentation all about what is the altar all about you know the idea is that we move to this world and we lose we lose touch with what's sacred so you want to kind of like physically creative space in which what is sacred is kind of easily seen that way usually recognize that way easily maintained as sacred in your mind and your heart the architecture and the ornamentation in the setting and the cleanliness and all of that
 is meant to serve our inner remembrance of that sacred reality
and so did you know this is a statement of theology but how does that theology play out you don't like how does it change you how to say transform you that's to me that's the real question is that John 3:16
 you know John 3:16 I don't know John 3:16 please don't lie to me only son and buy him you'll be saved is that 316
 Bible people on the tab out and help us a pretty sure that that's how John 3:16 Merrick can you work where do that for you to come on or waiting for you we got our whole Christian Club that's part of our Zoom group
 tallest tiger in the house talking to us as the temple
Holy Spirit okay we're God's so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life okay so that's this is the one that makes the Christians hate us you know that right I don't think it has to it doesn't have to but but yes I can tell you're so ungrateful God and gave your only son you're going to believe in all this other fairy tales yeah yeah but you don't listen to me okay this is a theological statement to but it is one that has to do with salvation more than transformation it has to do with you just have to believe this and then you're saved
 that's a very religious idea whereas here to Paul to the Corinthians this is more of a spiritual got more of a spiritual being to do not know that you are God's Temple that God's spirit dwells within you look within find find it within yourself your end
transformed by that understanding not just like I don't want to miss
 I don't want to misinterpret John 3:16 but certainly people commonly interpreted
 as nothing matters except your acceptance of this fact
 that God gave his son and that son died for your sins in as soon as you believe that your saved game over then there's no talk of transformation of your that that that idea is largely what Christian as Christianity has taught in the United States room that says not Catholics don't believe that don't believe what
 I've been jealous that she says evangelicals believe that statement about saving not Catholics
 well I know if you can select text
but a lot of that the entire emphasis yeah where is like spirituality you can say or yoga has to do with
 you know what how can I find Within Myself yet God is within me God's dwelling within me let me find that and let me be transformed by that in and how that will transform me something that provides going to be speaking about today and what we read it well you and I both know that yoga is the work of the devil but actually know it is only within me and in which the world needs now more than anything like some feeling of worth
 and we should have a feeling of worth because we are worthy people because we're spiritual people were part of God that this body is a temple in the spirit resides in the temple that's our default our default as we are worthy beings and then this whole concept of Dharma is to act in a worthy way while
in this world and it closed out from there to treat other people with worth why because they're actually part of God to like there for the concept of enemies doesn't even exist how can I have an enemy with a spiritual you might not like what they do and they're for keeping the Christian hate the sin epicenter
 so there's a desire to love people underneath even their behavior which is a very tall order especially in Kali Yuga when we are so damned self-righteous about everything we do and so condemning about other people
 good one good one today we're going to really dig into this more because I was going to go over there and
 his instructions to his little schoolmates Hot Yoga is heated by the Flames of Hell okay
 so weird
let's do it let's drink that cup in after the Ryan I'm the most good deal on that I'm sure I even wrote them didn't set us with India some to do that your Monday right before I started to see my bag with them witches are very means of Conquest when should I expect the base and see if the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan we see the super must be others are Swati the goddess of learning the author
 that's the appreciation about Reese you need to talk to you about a teenage the key but regular tension in class in the Box out and buy Battery Service the portability of all that is troublesome the heart become eradicated and loving service of the Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs we established as a revocable fact of the matter and elsya
porch light of knowledge I offer My Bae since he's at their load of speed-reading from the shoe my bag of Tom Canto 7 chapter 6 text 19
 who's speaking what's going on
 prahlada stop talking for Lab 5 year old boy enlightened being son of Prince he's a prince of the Young Prince son of a monstrous father with a king is teaching his classmates
 and he's giving them spiritual instruction and another father's not happy about at the school teachers aren't happy about it but
 if that's raising kids you can't always get them to do what you wanted to do yeah he's spoken quite a bit now about the the special opportunity that the human birth is
 how time is passing in the time shouldn't be wasted that should be we should value this unique opportunity that we have in
it in the short amount of time in which we potentially have it you know it he was breaking down mathematically just how much time is wasted in our life without us being able to aggressively pursue the goal of of self-realization the you know you're used his kind of wasted your old age could easily be wasted the time that you sleep is wasted did the hours just got less and less we got to use those hours
 to find that aim of all life and then you know he said it's it's rare that people achieve this shirt and and therefore it takes 18 you saying so therefore keep aloof from people that are going to slow you down on that path you know you're wasting your time if if you're not if you're not really conscious of that it's it's a it's so interesting how time is interwoven with illusion
I was in a we played some shows last weekend and you guys would come up meal and my band play some shows in Miami and Tampa which which refund was good to hang out with the guys and how's Walter doing really fun hanging out with them and some 1990s in 1990 and I saw you guys or something like that and it just like we did this we did that and I was like I don't remember remember that but in my defense that was thirty years ago
 it was 30 years ago and then another person who I did hang out with up for a long time and I haven't seen them since you know 2000 I remember him but it was like wow that seems like a moment ago I haven't seen you in 20.
New Year's
 so this is like the time factor is woven in with illusion and it makes time fly and it makes it seem like we have all the time in the world going forward and the fact is time is racing past and we're just trudging around dragging our heels and that's why there's this now is the time now has been there is an urgency sew-ins in any color you got we make the nonsense urgent on our way we just have a busy this but we forget to just make do what's important there's some important things not just busyness not just you know of urgency weighty things that I should ask myself waiting questions I've never asked myself waiting activities that are important for my well-being and my growth and the growth of everybody around me if I neglect everyone that
just me and myself it's going to suffer so this is what the box with Tom pushes those important but not necessarily urgent busyness of life and this is the
 this whole section on time flying is now getting a light reminded to us thank you thank you thank you wasted a lot of our time right there he sent you know yet what we need to do because this time it short because we have the spiritual goal because we want to realize our self free ourselves from from the control of the material energy and being stuck in the cycle of birth and death and ups and downs is just join it but then suffering so we have to use this time really well and ended the
focus should be on taking shelter and he's he's the origin of everything he's the source of everything he's used to the controller behind the whole Matrix of of the the world that were living and you connect with it now to this little kids when they hear that they may sound like well if he's so big and so important so powerful it must be really hard to connect with them like it's hard to meet people that are in big positions and so on going to speak to that
 my dear son's demons Esprit person out of godhead Narayan is the original Super saw the father of all living entities consequently there are no impediments to pleasing him for worshiping him under any conditions weather going to be a child or an old man
 relationship between the living entities and the Supreme personality of godhead is always a fact and therefore there is
difficulty in pleasing the Lord so right off the bat he's saying don't you have every possibility of making this connection and the reason is because you are intimately related to Narayan you are intimately related to Christian you're intimately related to that Supreme Being behind everything that is something that is something
 that should give hope that should get you know that that should make you realize this isn't difficult I just need to focus on her eye place right so it's so accesses they are here he's saying access is there due to relationship do to your intimate connection to that you have a friend in this unit use the Cerritos every day he not me know he's a he's a friend of all living beings three times have a boot on a Lenovo living entities why you got to do is just call out his name and
the end the next the next 20 to 23 so this is for versus
 we're hearing that yes we're in totally related with him there for it he's easy to access but also there's another reason why is easy access cuz just like if you had someone that you're intimately related with but they're very far away and you still might have a hard time connecting you to pick up on my caller ID I just ignored it and I would have been like to have a very clever
 text Winnie to 23 out of godhead the Supreme controller who is in alible and indefatigable great word is present in different forms of life from the inert living beings the Barra start over start over such as the plants to promote the foremost create a living being
so he did hear he's drawing you know you do from Top from bottom to top right like he's their present Narayan that one that's your thinking is hard to access he sure he isn't everyone's heart everyone yeah like right down to the plants all the way up to Laura brehm on the topmost being in the universe I just had a realization about plant lovers and you think I'm going to glorify Tamara but I'm not I'm going to condemn them I'm going to condemn them because they like plants just because they can control them is that why I disagree I feel like you spend time in the garden and you realize that you know you can't control them all you can do is give them some money okay you know what I'm going to think I'm this one again or I'm going to go deeper perhaps it's perhaps there's some truth in what you say
there's some truth in what I say okay so so okay so now he said he's successful because he's in every living body okay but not only that where else is he
 he's also present in the varieties of material creations and in the material elements
 the total material energy and the Goon has the material nature so it's so he's in the he's in the very fabric that the universe is made of the very ingredients his hickeys present his awareness is present there he's with in every atom or sometimes probably said he's even in between every out of me is it between he's in between the in between this and he's around the further expand even more Saturday and he is also the transit in
Super Soul the cause of all causes love that phrase cause what causes a band to whose present as the observer in the cores of the hearts of all living entities what's the Sanskrit for that Observer The Observer
 the witness
 at least one word for sexy so not only is he not difficult to ask you have special access because you related to him
 not only do you have special access because he's everywhere so he's not going to be hard to reach but also he's attentive he's he's tuned in he's observing right now he's in the he's not only the core of the heart of every living being but it's not like he's there and aloof is there and I'm very aware
taking it all in witnessing you just have to begin to try to feel the presence there try to feel it you live inside you
 are you sound like a southern baptist try to feel it inside you hated as that which is provided and as the all-pervading super-soul but actually he cannot be indicated as he is indicated as that which is provided and as the operating super-soul but actually he cannot be indicated
 what is a paradox I guess it's a he's indicated that I could look into the commentaries on this but I could just play with it enough for now he's indicated that indicated mean he's pointed out right he's identified
yeah but he cannot be indicated but but but he's just too broad to be you can't just kind of get him like you point your finger at something and like you kind of got the whole thing within the scope of that thank you got it figured out but he's beyond that you don't yeah so he's he's that which has provided everything's existing in him
 and he's also all providing he's existing and everything and perhaps this is why he can't be indicated
 okay
 is changeless is changeless and undivided he is simply perceived as the Supreme section under eternity knowledge and Bliss being covered by the curtain of the external energy to The Atheist he appears non-existent is not beautiful it's powerful to The Atheist to a non-existent you know he Christian if you want
at least you don't want to see if he'll allow that to happen to and not only that.
 Anyways a whole nother Sergeant maybe it's a bit of a squirrel
 butts
 you know when there's a squirrel this thing comes out I like the scarf cuz sometimes squirrels get cold not be able to find it quickly enough just to do that I may not be able to find what I want to read
 I look stupid got some goodies well again I may not be able to find this quickly enough
 I was reading it just yesterday though
 yeah I found it
the search what what's what's being indicator of this is the toughest and Arbor by sheebah goswami which is a book such a crepe this book is the key it's the key you got the key is it's where the absolutely most brilliant Century philosopher Jiva goswami
 is saying that you know what this all of these books are all the Vedas all through punished as all the you know there's a big massive works at my bar through with the bug of agita in if there's all these 18 price you pick up those piranhas and it seems like one is telling you she was the Supreme in this one is telling you Davey Supreme and this one to tell you this new supreme and using how do you make sense of all this and the answer has all the answers and he doesn't but he defends it like an expert lawyer you know he's got all his resources so you know he's got it
exhibit a bike right he's he's really laying it all out April he provides
 we're for so many centuries people struggle to kind of piece it all together he pieces it all together how we supposed to understand that if you that that Krishna Supreme when are you open up this other promising to be saying something else I guess what it means is there all supreme or it doesn't matter you can choose one you let you know yeah and whatever resonates with you building but you have to understand Krishna that he's not like this jealous God that wants to make you worship him when you open up to him he's totally there for you and if you want to take one step forward by by worshiping his devotees like stay in the form of Lord Shiva or Davey because of the modes of material nature that you're currently employed by Hill increase your faith in that as a positive step
forward without any kind of Hang-Ups like no worship me is not that's not him at all right so if you look at all those Teddy is not a jealous God he's not a jealous God do as you like it and so this is this is the commentary by goalkeeper on Adana that's based on giva goswami commentary so how much of it is going to be printed and how much is a Jeep is a little unclear at this point it was really hear what you got his face with the bewildered and complexity of the Piranhas how are they bothering the nonlinear crown and knowledge chronology cutting across Millennia and universes thousands of prehistoric personalities that are spoken of their the pantheon of DD's or the left and right yeah many just met the whole body of literature as an incoherent collection of competing sectarian mitts
 persons who choose to think and say
they might consider the extent to which material nature controls their supposed to freedom of judgment the little things maybe you're the one you know what the shortcomings not the promised the way such speculators filter what they see the way they form opinions and the influence they have on the public are all part of
 Nature's Arrangement ultimate that means Christmas Arrangement right sure Nate Nature's arrangement for keeping the secrets of transcendence concealed from the intrusions of mundane intelligence
 only bikes only by accepting the means of shoved a pramana truth through sound on its own terms
 can anyone begin to penetrate these secrets
 key what were you talking about why did I bring that up
cuz you're talking about the atheists don't want to see him by that's got we will raise that for you or you can explore that and I won't appear to you but but but we don't have to be there if we choose that we want to find him that we want to connect with the we have access we don't have a lot of time in this life but use it well and if it will work you know Focus now speaking of not a lot of time can I take it a little squirrel Journey one quick one Linda Linda Linda has a cold plunge bath and after the after the Nashville wedding last week where all the cold plunge bullies were trying to get me to do it but I was feeling slightly sick I said no but then we just every dad to the cold plugs with Linda Linda Linda not together ofcourse
it just holds one person and I tell you you really understand why Yogi submerge themselves in freezing water and then built fires around themselves in the summer in the heat because you get to a point of like I'm not this body and if you don't get to that point you live in a tub of complaints you complain you wine you scream you know if you plead you run away and it just makes you separate from your material frame and you could see how that actually can give you a type of mental peace but not necessarily give you a bhakti cold plunge will not on its own give you by not on its own it can give you other benefits including get rid of inflammation dump dopamine down your throat you know you don't have to get rid of some depression it can do that too so that's an interesting little squirrel my friends thank you
now this statement like other statements are going to be today this is a theological presentation then they provide is giving right he's saying God exists that exists within all living beings the plants all the way up to lorber ma not exist in the ingredients of the material universe that we that were that we live in
 he's observing everything you can connect that's all the theological statement but now how does that theology
 how does a cat become alive how does it become how is that translated into practice right like okay if I want to realize that God within me what do I do you know what rather than and it's not just just accept this or I just believe this is like be transformed by this have your behavior be transformed by this and gradual you're in a realization will follow that behavior so hot so how does this affect one's Behavior how does it
how does this knowledge of Gods
 omnipresence change me change how I behave Change the World to Change how we relate to one another this is a really great texture text 24 a lot there for my dear young Friends board of demons please act in such a way that the Supreme Lord who is beyond the conception of the material knowledge will be satisfied give up your demoniac nature and act without enmity or Duality show Mercy to all living entities by enlightening them and devotional service that's becoming their well-wishers give up your demoniac nature and act without Amity or Dua Leti so Indemnity means I have some hostility towards others Tuality me this was my friend that was my enemy this was cool that was not cool this when I hang out with I want to know know none of that show Mercy to all living in it
by lightning them about bhakti that's becoming their well-wishers so here we have you know not just it goes beyond that just believe in you we saved Saint believe and be transformed by it you know believe and respond to that belief through your behavior
 and in this way you'll be able to realize you'll be able to that access is there but it's not it's not just a question of belief you know it's a question of how you respond to that theological truth when people are dumping these tricks on us sometimes we're just spiritual weak legs just like if I if I if I if I bring somebody to the gym that never has gone to the gym is not really interested in going to the gym they're just like whatever they don't get anything out of it so when we go to these sacred literature
we're spiritual weaklings when we take a little bit in I might even try it and I'm just weak and that give up but it's like the end and sometimes people and it's due to a practice it's probably been going on for lifetimes and receptivity and and a good heart they developed the spiritual muscles to always make that right choice and always practice what we're dumping what the bottom of time is dumping on us and into the degree that I can just apply this stuff and hold on to the stuff and like we said earlier drink the nectar on a regular basis you just get stronger and stronger and stronger and that poison that cup of poison seems more and more unattractive
 as I as I've developed the spiritual muscles that that spiritual muscle you need to Velvet through reflection right by thinking these thoughts over and over until you actually go and see the world that way right by contemplating these truths you know okay
I'm in a moment of tension with another living being
 I reflect on all that prolonged said that my body is a temple of God God is right there inside me also inside this person just like inside every plant and it all the way up to Lord Brahma
 is that God is witnessing our activities right now that the God is a friend of every living thing including the one that I have this tension with right now is through reflection this is how do you know the saintly become sanely this is how did the real eyes to become realized it's through this kind of reflection and in again at 4. Same time is short so let's get busy reflecting like this let's start letting go of all the pettiness and let's let's put this into action you know like today is it a day or each one of us
 can have the opportunity to even even just send that let's say Justin are reading this what we're reading train discussing at that list
feeling like yeah I want to see that way right I want to feel that presence Within Myself I really relate to this and then you know you if you flip you flip off the podcast and then you're back in the world right and and just watch
 and see how that poor Mama create circumstances for you quickly we're in you'll have the opportunity to contemplate this truth in it in a moment of tension right and that's it and so when that comes it's not like oh God will you know who the another unfortunate circumstance my like knows like this is the fortunate circumstance my life is right here
 I have the opportunity to practice what I was reading about I have the opportunity to realize something more deeply and if when when we begin to see that we realized the whole
all day everyday is my field of contemplation it's not like I have to think of when will I be able to go on a retreat again now it's right here right now that you can reflect on the truth and respond accordingly spawned as purple as encouraging all his friends to respond to spawn with with mercy of respond with with wisdom the contemplation that you're free from from Mom Duality free from what was the word that is used
 enmity enmity even though this person give me every reason externally to feel some animosity towards him I'm not even to let that rise in my awareness I just won't even let it I'm going to stop and write down and it's important we don't mention the lot because we talked about like ingesting ingesting ingesting but what you're saying is important it's important to notice your thoughts and notice what
thinking about notice how you respond and and then do some like Corrections get some red flags are some warning signals like this isn't a good thought I'm going to end this. Right now we have almost become like psychic surgeons, devotees and devotees don't think like I'm a devotee of Lord Krishna and devotees don't think like that you know of our previous life within this and you know we got a residue or previous life and we have to like Slay Slay those demons even that they did the Demonic Bots low vibe
 low Vibe thoughts you know I was just also
 recalling you know prappas commentaries
 how they speak to you in different
sometimes things that he says that sound almost claimed but in Practical or right but then you realize know as you go deeper that's exactly where I need to be like right now and once you think of Krishna 24 hours a day you like you you're like my sleep has have these bad dreams she has a bad dream about me like once every other day come on you do apologize apologize for something you didn't hit your head doing bad things in the dream that make you happy to know that I'm doing bad things to her in the dream and I'm a workout so sorry it won't happen again you're endangering supercells I'm this guy's a creep you know maybe you know the words not we haven't we haven't done the tally
but sometimes promises like this she says like we know we should think of Krishna you know the entire day like all the time and it's very easy one just simply need such an Hari Krishna Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna Hari Rama. And it's actually a fact right it sounds like crazy talk but it's like no actually the and then that means everything everything the flowers we see a nature received received trouble we see we hear a tragedy it but we're always thinking about Christmas hands and all this stuff and where's Chrissie is behind everything yeah it is it in that mantra
 as weeds you know I'm Rugrats you inspire me I'm it's and it's inspiring to me that both you and I are feeling encouraged to chant more attentively and deeply by the way I feel like I haven't been that much in the last 3 days so today I woke up early and I sat there channel 12
I got in the habit you know what I did when I was a dummy would you do I just got myself a small Mala
 but one of those like 8. You know but your small beats so that I can wear like a necklace cuz people are doing that now days yoga people is that why it's not her. She could walk into yoga studio done that and water combine that with his I just everyday try to chat more than 16 rounds which is my bow my vows a chance 16 so my guys are chant more than you okay why do you got to check in with me to find out how much my check so I feel the when I have those bees around my neck. It just said whenever I feel the inspiration I can just chat around
the next around and when that round is like it's not your definitely not changing it to get it done because you don't even have to channel to get your sixty rounds and they're already done and then you chanted much and you chanted really taken shelter of it that you know with the face
 at this is radhakrishnan and the gold piece and that each one of these bees represents one of the Hundred Acre Wood piece you know and that you get the opportunity to Chan one Mantra in connection like that
 it really it really makes you you you you we hear about the saints that chanted 24 hours a day you hear about the kitchen a Christmas house property or a relatively modern day say God brother she'll probably known for his complete Detachment from the things of this world
don't get them until they were talking about here like having no duality in his in his reasoning or in his awareness you know known for his deep attachment for chanting of Christian saints that he was Channing all the time that if you could put the stethoscope to his hard to hear the Montreux going there this month or something that can be running through our operating system 24 hours a day and it's the thing that will Autumn at my very low stage of of awareness it's the it's the hook in it is the the key that can that can switch the gears in my Consciousness when they start to go the wrong direction that I could I simply just need to chance it and if I can't if I can't chant attentively when I sit down to chant japa then how will my mind when I'm not chanting japa be focused that's good one that's a good
look at it set so I really need to know what one of Channing job I really need that that that that attention really needs to develop in its it becomes easier than your you're thinking about it all day and then you know where ever you are whenever you are you can reach out and chain around or at least Channel mancha or at least chat a few more inches or leasing the Mantra in your mind when you go to sleep you can sit there and sing it in your mind it sounds crazy to other people
 but it actually comes so meaningful and real when you begin to understand that it's not just some random arrangement of syllables that everything is in that sound you know that is the most profound
 combinations of spiritual sound
 this is this is beautiful sometimes it I'm going to put a footing out here and I think you started already did but the stupid talk about Chantix 6 more than 60
some people are like I can't even get 16 rounds
 forget it I can't you are mentally sometimes I can't do it then I'm out of this chant would ever your chances first of all make a commitment to one round today and see how it's going to affect your life and and then if you want to raise it or chant more than that one round like I'm glad you have a commitment to one you can have a commitment to one and then chat more after that it is I'm going to think because yeah because yeah what is Santa Krishna you know I made my commitment and I've fulfilled that commitment but I want just like he's Chris like provides encouraging these boys there's access their reach out for it and watch that magic happen all day long that you'll find that Christian will be following you around all day long and that's what we talked about about 24 24-hour a little blue baby stalker
 we start Krishna Hill stalk us okay
Miss Mara we're going to have a crazy day today what is there a profound we stop a Krishna he sucks at the stockings got such bad you can't call it stalking night I kind of like the stalking yeah how about a little upset about where fans are fans of Krishna he's a fan of us as much as we got to figure out how we're going to do this show and I'm driving to Florida me and I have a wisdom of the sages meetings all day tomorrow and then another job in Florida stop pullover used to do that kind of thing
 or I just do it over driving I will be driving over here I was thinking more like Dirty Harry Crazy Mary
need for a good movie in the 70s was a guy girl in a car and a girl on a car and a six pack of beer and some cops chasing a spiritual life means always use the nectar
 that's a good teacher there Timothy T-shirt be transformed by understanding we have God within be transformed by understanding we have God within you we are all innately worthy beings your worth is your birth use a few remaining hours to focus on the goal of Life use your few remaining kill you don't make the nonsense urgent
was that my last one don't make the nonsense urgent I want salted not the minutiae the minutiae of that word of material existence
 what do you mean by that do I use it a lot
 when a fence okay Christina is not a jealous God like that do as you like
 develop spiritual muscles through reflection contemplation and practice
 and what kind of herb and burpees time is short let go of pettiness
 notice and corrector unhealthy thoughts notice and correct them not just noticed them correct them if I'm a devotee of Lord Krishna and devotees don't think like that that is a good Mantra Mantra be the key to switch
Consciousness let the month should be the key with the money by the devil that we call that a double metaphor the orange double stick shift right
 choose to chant and watch the magic happen
 it's a chance watch The Magic app
