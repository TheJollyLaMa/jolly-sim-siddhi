 I don't know if I can just like the saying that you can buy like maybe three four penthouses in New York on Tuesday filled the hole that answer the first time you held that in your hands
 actually it wasn't my first treasure just that their plate so I remember the very first one that I applied you know like the people I'd like to grill everyone else in the city this morning very honored and yeah I'm in
if you want me to speak about your other areas that I will get there last year about this time in Austria
 and friend of so many of my for you know friends who work your town musicians and but I believe were you born in the family of pot to Yogi's or did your family get into it after you were born
 interesting because nobody
 I was born in Moldova a country in a like her between Ukraine and Romania and the We Like official religion is Slavic Orthodox Christianity as though our parents are always interested in yoga and they've
how to sync my Russia Transcendental Meditation the same thing just a little bit of a vatika background behind you know so we always knew that.
 Eating meat was not good and I was so and I remember even as a young kid go to Power Christmas celebrations in the in the town back then they didn't have a sample so we will join in different places and the thermos remember how I was maybe I don't know 10 maybe and they were dancing in the kitchen and then want to go to just handle to me this cells produced
 I'm sure illegal copies of butter How He does care.
you know like first ever character and experience
 10 maybe around ten years old but I mean River in the temple here including a diamond like you're the only experienced that little did I know that later on she will become like a father to me and very dear person in my life I meant that's how we we do know like later on in the day and we were there to attend the grand opening and fever already older maybe I was 15 16 and that's the time when I started actually I was so fascinated by the cuisine because it moved over back then you couldn't get anything exotic alike and trying to Indian spices was really something to eat and then be my sister and I restarted
culinary courses in the temple and then a little later we found out that we are musicians so they started engaging Us in Carrollton and send it to sample be really loved it your sister and that meeting my whole life change them done now so let's just back up a little bit you must have been playing music even before then though like seriously
 yes yes I'm in I was born in the family of musicians my father was a famous trumpet player in Moldova my mom is a violinist and then she is a teacher in the school so used to teach there somehow you know like our destiny was decided for us
faded violin when I was younger I really wanted to play piano really really hate for the next nine years but somehow I had a very strict teacher and she should make sure that I Idlewild and I kept winning competition since I was young so later on when I was maybe 6:15 16 then we started playing in groups chamber music groups and it became a little more social than just violin practice and it started to ring so then since then I started liking it very much and also secure today I cannot imagine myself be happy that I'm that I had always told me
I think people that course you were born after the fall of the Iron Curtain as we would call it here I don't know if you would even refer to the shower that's exactly like a year or two after this yes but I think the people that grew up in in behind the Iron Curtain or in the Communist Eastern Europe you know that they were in America's just like I just want to do whatever I want to do but there is like no you do what you got to do to get trained up
 your parents tell you to
 escape the nurse you cannot protest kind of serious self-discipline and then when you said what age was it that you've began going to the temple and discovering Buckley on your own what do I how old were you at that point
stop and I was maybe 15 or 16 search Life In Your Own Way rather than just being directed but you start to have pursued it was interesting because I always felt a connection to God and my family was not like the you know like better regular Christians that we go to church like every Sunday I know I was just go once or twice a year for Christmas and Easter you know but somehow
 Elvis felt the presence of something greater than I am in a spray and actually you know something that I could speak to no one told me like I remember when I was a child that was troll the orphan kids over the connection that someone is there to hear me and I remember very funny today that I don't know I was praying and said I called I'm so sorry I'm so disorganized
I'm not trying to you everyday but I promise you and I'll turn tell I pray everything
 but I mean I didn't expect that later on I'll have a practice there every single day we got in touch with God and of course he came to mobile is that right or did you have to go somewhere to meet him in your home
 10 hours by car to 10 hours life-changing experience because I have no idea what I'm getting myself and I remember thinking temple being sixteen you're not having all this and I always felt this connection to
Godlike and in Tampa Bay would say like you need to grow is very important to have a spiritual monster and other side was feeling ill or something but I felt like fathers do this I'm okay but I kind of like how can I share this intimacy before third person you know I can be just like you man tell me the person that become became such a
 my banking as you as your as the world of boxing was opening up to you and you're learning all about it and you obviously care china such an important part of the practice of bhakti did you feel a connection on the musical level did you did was there an immediate kind of
 special feeling in the
music that you might have had it because of your background
 or was it more like an escape from the music world for you because on the different phases of my life I felt different about this you know but I find that did so intertwined
 actually you know I like I I didn't like violin but because of the ball and I met my groomer I've been here he go to know me and that's how we established a connection and then I started liking violent because it gave me my spiritual master and then also doing service in Carrollton and seeing how happy everyone was give me a lot of jobs but also the practices kirtan in a spirituality I noticed how much influence it gives me on my professional levels because when we go onstage we well for me the main goal is to play as sincere as I can to give
what about is there in the heart and to try to be like on measurements are not always easy but so many times when I would just pray because in the beginning I was a little bit you know conflict that has classical music and helped me develop myself spiritually but if the years of practicing and speaking to elevated cells and great people doesn't care to me in school been supporting me through all these years I realize that this is my service and once I engage my whole heart and all my feelings it can impact greatly the audience and that's how it happened because
 since I started seeing my classical music as a kind of my service people were approaching me and saying because
compliments that's all and that's when I realize that you know the universe is not sleeping and it's working I'm in a better position and try to to give all I can it's can actually better this is classical music in which doesn't have the direct a month right there but I could see how people learn at standing there thinking about something higher and more pure and sure the important classical music was written and composed
 for the glory of God the right quick composed for church and so
you're playing that music is it almost like you in your heart you're playing it for the pleasure of God you're playing it like to the ear of God is that how you think is that how you meditate when you play
 it's in the perfect in the perfect States yes you know that just like a course there is still stage fright I mean whatever I've been playing for the last 25 years but it's not as it was twenty years ago like when it really shaking but still like there is a huge responsibilities sometimes more than the other and you managed to reach that state of calmness and the when you're really in the music you forget that you're being watched by 5,000 people and filmed by live streams and everything
 then this is possible to attain this
 I don't know not Serenity because music can be actually very you know like very passionate and very all different dresses
China likes you get on the different levels but there's no people anymore and you are very much in the in the music and I cook myself a few times then there's like love love teams are something thinking about radhakrishna and their enjoyment and sometimes I think directed but sometimes it in directly I don't think necessarily o Radha and Krishna but I definitely tried to convey his love and of keertana Psych folk music
 and and then of course there's like Indian classical music
 but you know I think both venues like another the simple music that the common people can play can can sometimes be the best music to convey your feelings but also there's a i
yeah you know that it ended makes a lot of sense cuz like when we here like when the gopis are playing music for for Radha and Krishna they're the most refined sophisticated you know musicians there's certain things that can that are the skills
 can facilitate
 the communication of the heart better than that you know what did the greater the skilled perhaps the greater that you can communicate what's going on in your heart and of course princess like bog with time
 which in our lineage we consider the most mature spiritual expression the most mature expression of Love is written poetry right it's not it's it's it's written in it you know it it's like a song you know so I had imagined that this classical music you could it it does stimulate
 special refined emotions feelings for God and when you're
you can maybe feel like you're floating in that
 yeah I mean that's what I meant when we get some technical abilities technically speaking when you feel more friend whatever you do then you there is a space for the mind to calm down about the technical things and you can dissolve yourself and do some music in the story because every time we play musical piece the story and so we take in consideration by the composer wrote and what he felt in that moment than what did he try to come but just music for example you know men do something when he wrote his better famous violin concerto he was so heartbroken because he's like a Beyonce left him there's a big love story. You know Sarah and
about the box for writing so much music at 90% percent of music is all about God all about prayers and God and universes and you can emerge like you can really get different different different and that's so nice of you to play music like that but there is also a composer that wrote about war and the tragedy end of paying people and the funeral so many different situations so this is like acting do you know you have to take yourself you're only go out but yourself and I am in a position where you just transmit do you know you just try to come back and in my case I always try to think like how can I personalize it you know so
life situations is just Moringa what's happening in the spiritual world and that's good
 to attend the technical abilities are you can actually you know that's a lot of practices it's essential that when I was younger I was practicing a lot like to be able to gain some dates and something to steal so much more to develop their agents like I do not consider myself but there may be in the in the middle but there's so much more to learn and to grow and I wanted to speak to you about that aspect of practice or discipline for the past week and in on our podcast we've been reading from the 7th can wear
Narda is describing to you to steer all the different Barn is an ashram it's all the different the codes for living according to the different stages of life for the different occupations and some of them Regis like as a severe disciplinary you know it it's it's in any way imagine like you know brahmacharya at the age of eight years old you know going to Guru and and being disciplined in this way by embracing this discipline for their kind of to refine their refined their knowledge or find their character certainly the practice of yoga in the practice of bhakti self-discipline is such a key element you were engaged in such a serious self-discipline from from a very young age. Imagine where you like
 45 when you started practicing
 more like 7 that's it that's kind of almost a group
major to be like 8 years old you know you go to the garage when you when you began to learn about yoga and learn about bhakti did you was there connection made in your mind regarding the discipline involved did you feel you had an advantage baby or did was there something that you related to
 it's very interesting what you say because it's true like I started actually when I was three and a half my parents Also may pursue gymnastics professional hair stylist doing this for 12 years then I started music and all my teachers are very strict the Soviet train the gymnastics teacher she was extremely strict with make us run around the leg without the new brakes and
so you know like not to eat when we remix. You know like you know crazy crazy discipline and so you know like no one looks at us as the kids for like 3 4 get your butt fired or her. And I am so grateful for everything but she was extremely strict to my parents my mom was very strict because I remember my my day being like this being in school in the morning then coming home having a lunch then for 3 or 4 hours I would be at a training for the gymnastics come home have a dinner and from 8:08 p.m. till 12 p.m. maybe 1 p.m. in the night at my mom would sit still and then started with me to go to sleep like at 12 or 1 a.m. and then wake up in the morning
and then I started doing all the art school but that's something that I really enjoyed so just so you know I love and then of course I was trying to be like that you know like
 but I'm about to go to Ace and I started getting deeper into the philosophy and made sense because sometimes it just takes to wake up earlier that whole day is aligned I know it's a smoke thing if you want one things like what kind of actually can do so much with such a simple thing is just waking up early if you go back about 4 podcast so we got an exact this. I said what it what is there like one thing you know that we could do and we said wake up early
 and it's is so interest I just noticed because I had different face
I was very disappointed cuz that was young and then of course when I left home I was 19 21 22 starting Universe Indiana and somehow you know I like to resent old it's like constant pressure I would have days when I would just like not how the alarm to wake up and I was like I want to allow myself to sleep in the DraStic impact of just a simple thing is making up early or how are you how's your times for your spiritual practices in the morning or yoga or briefing or whatever something to start your day off
 and it's so it's really really very very different once you start your day like this early in the morning when you have the static do not there and then throughout your whole day and then
you have both of them you're just like and then you wake up in the morning and I'm sorry I'll be very honest sometimes I just like to suck my dick so you can get cake you know how do you spell it I feel it and then I feel that my state of mind is just don't have a ride and I get angry easily and then I'm starved and I'm I'm patient and then I'm like I don't even want to play very nervous and then sorry I noticed how interesting that having a spiritual discipline can mean so much and the quality of your chanting is just so different I want to ask about that because when I
 ii-vi practice book to yoga for about
 15 years or so and then I began to practice along with it Austin and had a very good teacher in a serious teacher and he explained to me that the Vinyasa yoga that we're doing
he described that it's like Joppa that there's there's a sequence of asanas
 and just has like there's a sequence of beads on a thread the thread this time together the sequence of Austin as it's the breath which remains steady through the mall and the concentration goes on 1 OST deep into one Asana and then it's releasing it goes deep into next one just like you concentrate on 11 Mantra on one be to the next to the next to the next and I made that connection and it affected my a surprise but it also kind of really helped me understand why I'm chatting on these beads but but did you feel that kind of continued the discipline in the maybe gymnastics practice as well but also in the in the music did you fill a direct connection to the Joppa practice
 very much so because you know
it's the same as it's always the kind of like development so you can start okay let me get my be a bad example but that's what came to my money do you start your first day job but your mind is running the second day still running Karen dirty the third day worth it on the Mantra and you get there and then you notice yourself just praying and it's being very sincere and then it's not just out to Michael Jackson do together but it's like you know like that's close to Simon music
 you can play one day that passages not going to work out the new place I can buy the new play Third Day then it's getting better and better and better and better. Can you take a violin and then the passage not working
so you always have to maintain some kind of steak do I noticed that in my musical practices and okay at some level it's not anymore about being able to play a passage or not but it's about some settle things that you have to be playing more probably to be a little difficult if I explain the disparity musical Oriental but of course you can but I'm in this house like something happens where you're not in bed too and you're not trying enough for me discipline
 in spirituality is just so much more difficult than actual discipline and that's a lot because like still practice violin is one thing but to always always be alert with your mind
I'm trying to it is really a challenge and examples of how to write notes Farm in speaking about the you know like having patience do that than others being discouraged because you feel like you're you're chanting is not as good because you know like the story about how she tells about the Bumble that you have to go and water 800 I suspended the not not grown up every single day have to water it and then just did one day I just drove into what what I was thinking of him I would have gone to share was with that same yoga teacher that I spent his name is that Eastern and he's got it
 Yoga Studio in New York call the stronger yoga New York we've had him a couple times and interviewed him a couple times on the show so one day
brought a speaker about Yogi but from another lineage rather than ours
 is some of that I became friends with intent appreciated but the first time we met he kind of it would he was speaking to I don't know maybe a hundred people at this event at this yoga studio and we were introduced and then he began to speak and I'm sitting right in front of him and he I don't think maybe my yoga teacher maybe not and I and I doubt anybody else in the room knew what he was doing but he began to criticize our our lineage subtly and things that I could understand but most of these people probably use a looting two things that most people would probably picking up on or or understanding that they were connected to me in my lineage like he he was saying these things and I counted cuz he eat it at once he did it twice you didn't answer and I began to count he did it 11 times
and so why he did that I don't know but we became friends after it's but one of the things that he said was one thing that he criticized which is something that's very fundamental in our lineage is the idea of Channing a certain number of rounds of Joppa each day and he spoke of it as like what's the point in doing something mechanical better you just chant one time and do it with your heart and soul and like that
 which there's some truth in that but I've spoke to my yoga teacher about it and I said what did you think about that
 and I just disciplined a stronger Yogi he said
 he said even if in the beginning we're not doing it with full heart the repetition is very important because that's how we would that's how we build impressions in the mind you do it one time it doesn't stick but if you everyday you do something steadily then
naturally it becomes easier and easier and then you then is so much easier to put your heart into it and so that you did there's something to that kind of discipline the discipline of chanting japa that even were not feeling it so much it's our devotion to do it everyday in for not feeling it and the day may come where is like bamboo we're like in an instant that it just starts the devotional sentiment start to grow faster I mean like I feel about this more In a Sentimental guy because like I feel like I kind of summary and absolutely hate doing but Krishna likes me to do then I do it and then I see probably that's this constant repetition is just showing our dear one. We really want to do it for him and then dressed out it's like you know cuz those nurses there and then
do you know the neural science behind it but I just like to feel that the okay to see the how do you remind it how do you reduce it to me so I want to do it everyday where my grandmother said that I gave the promises of course we have difficult sometimes it's just that you caught up in trouble more than I stay in one place is challenging I do not want to lie it's better than a challenging to stay focused and do it then and with all my heart but whenever I do it is just like I try to do it but of course sometimes it's just going to be a job buying the Subway or or it's in the plane but still I mean I still feel so much Mercy it's too so much because he
 I don't know that's why I I love her
because it's just the nurse for the events of the most like I'm serious people like I am the end love coming from from people around us from keratin used for a teacher's from the divorce from the community of every single time I go to India just like it's time for full on Richard that's nice then the whole year earlier that I was on point when you were young you had a teacher that was very strict but that you adored I think that's the word that used some of that you are and when we were reading and by the time this description of the brahmacharya so that the brother charged it to serve the guru with I think the term users which like a it's a bit my Myra but like within the mood of firm
friendship like there should be some genuine affection in the heart even though the teacher is so strict
 if there's a love between the two
 then then something can be powerfully transmit in there's a Russell there's you know what this is. Your ass at where there's someone that you feel is your Superior
 you feel in the heart a deep respect and gratitude and in a feeling too I want to please them
 like that is that is that something that you felt in your in your musical practice and in your devotional practice or have you found the opposite of that sometimes and has that affected your ability to grow
 it's interesting because they're all looking for love all the time and and appreciation and so that's definitely something I felt bring in the temples and there was constant
 love
I joined I joined in the Moldova the temple was really very very special and everyone was just very encouraging my music alive because classical musical world can be pretty toxic gun. And my teacher
 she was extremely strict and my my next teacher after her was even stricter than her but she was he would be able to throw a music man wouldn't like Carrie and Elsa and the different different people I think my love
 definitely I definitely love her because but my love to her group this year's and I just realized you know not always the people that built
not everyone that will praise you actually wants good for you so deeply care that I'm good and I I do what I need to do that's why she was insisting on doing things you know so that's why I kept being success thanks to her and my mom's art work and not think I'll just let you know I like to spoil her that I realize that's her strictness is actually her love to me and
 I ate I teach now myself and I realize sometimes it's just sometimes there. Those student that you need to give them a little kids you know to bother they are better or there's different students that actually real understand only love language but I do not do anything to get your heart rate down
so maybe I was that type of a student that needed to kick her and she should probably sell it to me and I know it don't look right for the hurt and as in 54 days
 you know it's different because they're did you ever have a chance to meet him in person or but it was at I've loved and without that it would have been unbearable he was very strict disciplinarian
 I think one can feel the real intentions of the heart even if sometimes the people around can be strict with us tell us our four
you feel that love that this coming from their heart and sometimes the opposite you know you feel this fake nice words but then you don't feel anything you do you feel that I was napping company from that if there is no connection you learn to to realize what's real and what's not real and that's an interesting practice you mentioned that the classical music world can be toxic
 and so your own in your own life as a practicing bhakti yoga knee you have many chime sure that the constant travel must be challenging I'm sure the pressures of Performing must be challenging I'm sure the relationships with people some of them toxic must be challenging how do you negotiate this this world with you with you
body practice
 I have to say that
 I'm so glad that I I came in touch with the back to practice pretty early but I was 16 17 yeah right now and my spiritual Master does been guiding me
 the most difficult times because then I left a very comfortable life in Moldova they're my family took care of me very happy family my dog lick my nickname to my mentor my friends my language that I could speak of I did need to pay bills and everything and then I just left the studying the University of Vienna one of the best universities and difficult because Austrian Moldova have totally different mentality for a German mentality to it it's the
the different I didn't know the language much I didn't have much your financial support and I didn't have friends I didn't have and here I am in one of the best university what do I do no divorces back down in Vienna practice and understanding
 Karma understanding the nature of problems and Barbie come from and why they come to you and what how positively cannot like it was the positive impact of the problems in your life I know it sounds if it's ridiculous but then sometimes when we try to learn from situations and turn our struggles into your strength that was and I'm very glad it happened so because I lived it and then I lost my father when I was 24
actually I wasn't going we're done doing the parade from on the cover down when I just got the news that my thoughts and father suddenly passed away so it was hard for blue and we prayed for him and death
 I adored my dad and we had a really fantastic relationship and to be honest I thought that if he's going to leave it's going to hit me much harder but because of this practice of the understanding of life that's in our and they're all the rules and everything beautiful things that our soul is Never Dying give me so much
 support and understanding of the situation and I just feel I love him of course I miss him but I know that she's in a much better place right now and so many prayers been saved and then make sure that he's continuing a nice life or whatever she is the same thing every single time
I had a very challenging situations in my life example I remember one of my violin teachers
 started spreading some groomers that do not talk to her because she'll just learn all you people she's in the rear back that they have like them so recorded it has a sexual orgies the drums and stuff like this and then I heard of this knowing right and goes through the university and of course people numerous of people also knew what I'm living can but I had many friends they've been able to to to identify this is just lies but it was insane to see like and you know that and you of course I mean it's not easy to be someone sticking out of the crowd and the crowd where everyone drinks alcohol has absolutely free relationship
whatever baby want me to think that I'm always in those parties sometimes you're just telling the phone doesn't ring doesn't have fun in life and whatever but then sometimes you realize that that was kind of like more fun than those people didn't need to drink alcohol to be fun and to befriend to be nice and it started changing during the years you know so many friends that got to know me better just to realize that this is just the spiritual practice that I chose and I do not push anyone yeah I made my choice then in may have done just like isn't just started following the same part 2 and yeah I just realized that the more open-hearted you are
I'll try to harm anyone even sometimes with the
 ultra preaching can be sometimes negative you know you just love their people do their thing and it's very inspired their heart is open then they just take it and yeah but I have to say that I'm constantly guessing criticism and I hear things about myself also and struggles when there's a constant constant competition is crazy competitive it's worse than classical music is probably ballet
 there's so much pop music I I love both music many people think that would be classical musicians only listen to classical
I do not like I wasn't everything else but not but it's the classical music is of course the very small percentage of the population that list instead it took a bit of Pop Rocks as other other John Hughes write so of course the world is much smaller the places are how to say limited and there's so many great musicians right now it's just insane all good so the competition is there and it's very fair because there's a really great young musicians that are there and it is social media rise today to be a successful musician classical musician are you
 you not only have to play good you have to look at you have to be social
have a great manager you have to know how to sell yourself like a marketing and everything cuz then she be on stage because you could have one month of disappearing from the stage like here you go the hell you know it's very fast is developing is changing so much online contact contact content which is very important now that I've seen many of my friends that the great musician but they just they're not able to follow up to this Crazy Ray's costume changes every just like quick or seeing so many of my colleagues have this big depressions and you know of any house I'm so lucky to have this understanding that I do know you have in your life what you meant to have you do your best of course
 they're helping us outside of this and I told you to let go
attention to where the real happen is is that's inside doesn't matter whether your class composition or you're just a housewife for you or you take care of things I'd like to come be a sweeper outside you can be so happy in life you know so unfortunately not many in our domain and Fields and some pickles for damn like being successful is such a cold and and they actually better depressed so yeah I'm in I am very very happy to tie this surgical knowledge
 been able to carry me and for me not to be broken and also passing having difficult situations in my family.
and also career-wise and you don't like there's two challenges and the spiritual practice is actually the key to be her sometimes we like to use it more and sometimes we are little ignorant back to use it to now so don't get affected by all this material desires and everything so if I answered correctly I don't get that was actually that was such a brilliant
 a brilliant example or display of
 something that we talked about very regularly on the podcast which is something straight out of the bug of agita is Christian call Toronto Suka this conviction and it's understand this feeling experience that my happiness lies within
 and unless you have that
 you're going to be dependent on something external to find it and send it so what to speak of when it's in such a competitive World until I Rise to this by
I'm not going to be happy and even if you get there you may find you're still not happy because actually that's not where it happened since I wear as if you can have it inside all along you can pass through all those pressures with with without it burdening you so much for that all of that. All that tension that's that's an amazing inside thank you for sharing that
 bank in my position I had the opportunity to meet the very influential people and sometimes presidents of many countries that remember last year I played in The Summit in Moldova bear like about 60 very very important presidents of the country flag Prime Ministers were underlined was the president of the European community
commission it is and there were like also macron and the British prime minister close to this people you still realize that humongous highest positions doesn't make them inhuman they're still human Vegas heard they are sad they're happy that they have their own problems I remember I will not reveal the name but speaking closed it to one of the leaders of the country and we had such a great child and so much to do and he has a lot of influence and money and fame and Prestige but there are still things that are bothering the ones below
 find the you know like happening to me and then you go to India you go to Brenda and your citizens beggar that has the most happy
eyes ever. I always like to learn from this local people in India sometimes airport. They are so happy to serve you. Milk that they have out there and it's incredible to see how friendly they are older than freely have almost nothing left for them self and they see some you know tourist bus Turner staff will give everything just come to my place will feed you everything and it's it's a very inspiring moment thing that people realize what the real doesn't require
 I don't say that the famous influential or rich people kind of be happy of course you know we're running out of time of a thank you I just want to thank you so much for spending this time with the site I want to share that
last summer I was there in Austria with you and we were staying with friends on this beautiful Lake and we take this not exactly a boat I don't even I forget what they call it but it's like this station, flat wooden deck that just kind of goes out into the middle of the lake and we're having beautiful kirtan
 and I was sitting would like right behind you and you were playing you're playing violin so I was like I could almost feel the vibration in the the strings that everything you know and I never been so close to someone playing violin
 don't you played it tonight that I almost felt like oh I could do that it seems so he's widely people recognize the violin as as an instrument that's like it it's seems like a human in a way it expresses emotion in a way that other instruments can't do
and commonly you know like all in the Cure times you know the kirtan singer would sing the Mantra in a particular malady and then maybe they would
 turn to someone else to sing it in when I go around a bit and then they return to you and no one would sing but you would sing it on the violin
 and you know that if the feelings that are are are conveyed to a very tangible very real very you know very moving very they move the heart in the end that's really what we're trying to do through body so thank you so much for the service that you do like that maybe I don't know if there's any recordings or where people can find you playing violent of the people can search you out easily on the internet for your classical music is there a place people who go to find your you're playing in kirtan
