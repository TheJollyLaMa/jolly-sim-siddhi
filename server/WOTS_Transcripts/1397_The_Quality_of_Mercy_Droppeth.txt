What's up with your children events in Palm cook something delicious I heard that yeah I got busted that's my secret recipes was Henry's favorite I decided to make for the entire Mario Simon's Jones Clan family cooking and she's like number one kru kid it didn't pop up a Tony is like a great Chef from South I bet I bet you that I made it with the name Papa Tony sounds like you're going to coming out of the kitchen right yeah yeah yeah and then Bobby made some food came over it was right all right let's dive into the sir
 I've got a nugget today cuz you know how this matter came up and came up in on the show on Friday
because we're talking about do you know like I act like actually today hopefully today the channel to change it we would know for sure but if if my 33 video class on 15 chapter bug of agita that was recorded Upstate up there so far back in the day today or are they dropped dropped that was a joke and it has confirmed it will drop today he's posting it right now it's a matter of fact right right so I did but then you would inject a little to the term drop pressing on all this way back or going to sound like a sound like a bad thing to drop something that's so sometimes dropping this a good thing
 so you in the show me started about dropping Mercy that we got info traffic Shakespeare from The Merchant of Venice and this is a this is it it's one of the most famous Shakespearean
what do you call it
 quotations yeah well at quotations there's got to be a better word for that right
 dumb literary term Rose
 and Shakespeare for some shelter songs by the way it was yes and we always knew that that was coming from I think I was literary you origin but I this is the other this this is from The Merchant of Venice I think what happened was The Merchant of Venice took out a loan
 and then the Shylock the that the loan shark was Uniqua and pay back and I think he was going to kill
 the the merchant
 and then this was someone forget the person's name but they're kind of like appealing to the Shylock to be merciful and in doing so they speak of the nature of Mercy
which is a really important at all important topic when it comes to discussing Buc-ee's and not her go for it it means we're not really qualify but we're going to get
 why do people care up for us why do people love us white people the reason why we're here today is that often times most often that cuz we deserved anything so number. One was very kind to us someone extended their hands I would realize that bhakti is a highest thing you can give someone people's connection to source is the highest thing and that's how you get back to you it's been given by the mercy of others so you will read this in The Shakespearean voice. English is not strained my dear customer it drop it as the gentle rain from Heaven upon the place beneath
 it is twice blessed
I saw it. It blessed Hotel Gibbs and him that takes okay talk to you later and to give her aunt Mercy it's blessed and when you receive his Blessing over hearing and chanting so there's a speaker of the bog with him in the listener of the bog of Tom and both are blessed
 book in a box
 Tis the mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throne and Monarch better than his crown if you I think that means when it says it becomes like it becomes him it it's right not that it becomes a necessity transforms but it becomes
 you know how that word issues like that it becomes him like it sits on it looks better on him or something like that right it becomes him better than his crown right Mercy is better than all the wealth of the Kings
you know like some guys walk into town with a suit but he's got a Rolex it's the Rolex at the big thing for a king is that a lot of beautiful clothes but it's Crown is all the jewels but what shows that he's still in a better way it is a quality of Mercy more wealth in that Crown is his Mercy deceptor shows the force of temporal power. A power they just a little bit how are you just temporary the attribute to all and Majesty we're in. Sit The Dread and fear of Kings guess that's what Kings have to have their power that comes behind them sudden Mercy is above this sceptred sway
 it isn't thrown in the hearts of kids it is an attribute to God himself and Earthly power. Then show like it's God's when mercy Seasons Justice
no wonder this guy so famous he's such a great Rush
 imagine what it must be like living in the world of kings I was imagine what this character William Shakespeare was like but okay the world of kings yeah I mean it was just a few moments ago where everybody had a kink in your kind of at the mercy of this King and Heaven King was too had some Dharma you had said there was a way to be a good King and there was a way to be like a horrible can they were horrible King they're also very gracious King Leck Mercy
 give me his card King give me a good Noble righteous King I'll do it recess
 you got a bunch of uneducated people voting for uneducated people criminal people so you know the last line
I mean the whole thing is just like Chuck full of
 interesting and helpful ideas when mercy Seasons Justice right that these two are commonly seen as opposite ends of the spectrum on one end you got Justice the other than you have mercy
 Justice Means okay you going to get punished you going to get the dude what you're getting for your just rewards you if you committed some foul you offended in some way well here's the Justice come in and then you know I'm breaking out the chapter for that and then the other and there's Mercy like okay you committed some type of offense you did something wrong you you cause some kind of harm some kind of injuries something something done was done that was not
 to the standard but perhaps we can Overlook it perhaps that the punishment doesn't have to come down and and you know that that tension plays out
you don't constantly in our lives right it's not just the the king that's dealing with the tension between mercy and Justice photo every one of us in our personal dealings are you know having to negotiate that that they're trying to find a balance it's the parent with the kids it's the
 it's the people that were in the workplace that we're dealing with some that are actually very cool and friendly and some that are like causing us pain yeah it is big one for devotees to opt into for them to the actual reward who is balancing body for devotees it's so important because it in any kind of relationship that that bounce will do you know finding the bounce it hehe I like the way he says it's an Earthly power dust then show us like Gods when mercy Seasons Justice what would a season's it right when it's when it's blended into it
it just is going to have to be there we can't just throw out all of the structure that we have 220 in this world to keep a certain stability but it it should be seasoned to should they should have mercy Blended in and that quality of Mercy for the devotee
 you know
 there's a there's a one we talked about achieving the goal of bhakti which is divine love writing means that the heart is entirely melted that so that it can become so sensitive that it feels
 these these on these these flavors you know of love and so really all of our practice all of our Mantra all of our rituals and all of our The Advocates that we follow in all of the disciplines that we apply in our lives you know in relation to box
 we could just say it's all just to soften that heart to get it softer softer
and there's a statement you know in the book the rest of me to send a Rupa goswami the Great Sage you know such an important figure in our lineage where he he he says that when you get to the stage where does the you know like he's he's comparing body to be like a plant you know that they just got to see Dan needs to be watered and gross and when it pops out of the ground we call it a sprout right it just Sprouts out brand new but it's there it is I'm seeing it for the first time it's alive it's it's it's it's growing he's a cause that's that's they just called baba baba is this is the stage just before Prima which is the very core of divine love and that bothered pops out of the ground it says when it pops out of the ground he says it's like a genre of love for Krishna and at that time the body this one's experiencing it causes the heart to be softened by various tastes
and you could be said that you're on that stage of Bob and now you're just looking so it it's growing it's it's alive that it all of this hasn't been a waste of time if that's actually it is prima is on the way so so that the quality of a soft heart
 is really all that we're working towards and if we're not going to be capable of applying Mercy in our lives and seasoning whatever Justice we might need to to to meet out with Mercy for how we going to get to that place in the short lifetime that that we get that kind of heart you know
 yeah
 what's the opposite of
 that Grace and that Mercy is is
 when I when I start putting people categories of in a people that didn't do me right
and I feel like a first of all there's this idea of all the people had a problem with me I keep a list of all the people that have wronged me and then I'll get my Justice it did are going to get there they're going to get Justice instead of mercy and I'm going to be I'm I'm going to distribute talked about this the other day I'm going to distribute that Justice I'm going to get if I get another chance at that I'm going to get them for it so there's a hole beside the softening of the heart it's it's a it's a relinquishing of heavyweight we've been carrying around a long time a burden of resentment of burden of spite of burden of Revenge and it really sits within the mind of people you know what are the 12-step program they have a whole thing where you have to go along and you have to sort of empty that sack out and take a deep moral in inventory a powerful moral inventory
and release all of these resentments you have you write down the people you're actually holding onto a resentment for own your
 own your part of the pie off of times it's a big it's an interesting thing we tend to think long and now and that failed relationship I have you know 4% but basically the other person's got 96% and very often the more were actually very honest with ourselves we realize we have more and more of a percentage of that pie by 8% at the most
 the problem is one problem with not only responsibility for our shortcomings is if we don't own up to it when we want to go further and other relationships then instead of like starting with a clean slate we're bringing our bad communication skills were bringing are bad in a personal habits
and we're sort of like sneaking them right into a new relationship because we've never we've never done any autocorrect cuz we feel like what we've done nothing wrong I've done four percent of the problem but often times there's no supper flexion and then there's no fixing anything and that's why it's a part of self-realization is realizing what is a little broken in me we talk ourselves dented cans and sometimes or it looks a little broke and it's okay to be a little broken that's where in the material world broken and I have to notice which really broken about me because it's going to really sabotage friendships Partnerships relationships in the workplace relationships with my kids and if I don't know if it's everybody else's fault there's no growth there's just me you know in a winding out my you know like a little tweet, it's going to play out and Emily fall or SubFinder such rolling into the same rights again and again instead
learning from past mistakes patterns yes charjabug exactly figure eights you know why
 I thought I'd never read them The Merchant of Venice but if I understand this passage correctly you have someone appealing to this to this loan shark in a loan sharks are pretty generally pretty rough characters soon oh yeah and I and they also were depending on their you know violence generally you know it in order to 2 to do their do their work
 and you know what that comes from ego like I'm powerful like I'm like a king and so it seems like this person is cleverly trying to appeal to to them by saying that you know a real king even God you know like the most powerful figure what makes them so special is actually the mercy is there quality of mercy so like if you really want to be like a king or be like God you know and I know and I know you're like
that then that then you know we were expecting you to to demonstrate that Mercy now which is kingly and God like
 you know but that that quality of God is so much highlighted involved with time you don't may be the most famous example of it is what we read back in the sixth can tell where a job he lived such a degraded life cause to harm to so many and so on but at the very end of his life he chanted
 hhn of the name of Lord Vishnu narayanaya & The Messengers that were meant to deal Justice the the Yama dude is are coming there. About to drag him out of his body there and just because each and that name even without intentionally calling out to Vish know he's calling his son it was named the right that that the messengers of Lord Vishnu
show mercy and in The Messengers of yamaarashi I'm a dude is that like we don't get this Justice demands that this person who's out with this in a certain way and the bishop more less demonstrative we don't understand just how merciful the heart of God is you know just how much is willing to bend over backwards you know 2 to 2, Nate has to show mercy and that sometimes I don't know if I have the same way every now and then I go through the struggle.
 You know you enter into a society of bucks yogis and some of them you like more than others but you are attracted to certain people try to little crazy yeah and then sometimes they passed away
 okay and then the people that you don't drive with pass away yeah yeah and then and then and then you
you something reminds you of them and you wonder you know I wonder if they'd she is a goal of bhakti in this life I wonder if they
 transcended this world broke out of the Matrix you know who were freed and in the end the something you said not they don't deserve it or Rising me a little bit that attitude like yeah I don't want them to you know they they they don't know if it's not even that they could think of me that wants them to have to
 learn a lesson if it has yet to learn their lesson and then then then the thought comes to me like
 what am I thinking if I should be hoping it would you know from the poor of my heart that they received all the mercy you got it and want to speak of the fact that cuz if they did
then it makes it so much more likely that I might as well you know you even from that selfish perspective as my mom had a so sick in the head so we have to put ourselves in our brightness of a chopper with Sharon to my my efforts and we don't think like that right Lego how can I think like all I hope that person didn't get the full Mercy you know our heart has to soften if we're going to make it in this bucket world is not it's not a external practice is not the merely an external practice you know it's all about that. That's what you always love that song I I think there's certain songs I think we're the songwriter just kind of nail that they just that they're generally kind of simple songs and they just kind of really convey the messages
 just so well and I always think of that song Heart of Gold by Neil Young you know it's just like it is you know we we searched and we searched
in what sense that is what we're doing through boxes were moving to this world trying to achieve that Heart of Gold that pure heart that soft heart and that's what artists like it's so often by the seasoning of Mercy I like that sprinkle that on their reasoning of Mercy sprinkle with Mercy on that Noah was driving I was sharing my body with him and see what drop is see what your help with hear the rhino in the most of them before sending it to my bike what time which is a very means of Conquest when should offer respectful of basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan BC the Super Bowl she went being the most saraswoti the goddess of learning
 that's the prettiest about race Unity
regular tennis in class in the Bogota Man by rendering service a devotee all that is troublesome to the author all those Troublesome to the heart would become erratic hated and Lobby Services Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs will be established as a reputable fact oh My Gana to put on this is my she going to be in Omaha I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes are the torch of knowledge after I pay since he's after a load of speed-reading from the shoe box with Tom Canto 7 chapter 15 text 9
 yes
 well usually you can keep me up if you want sometime so we had a fascinating verse last what where it where it and she did you decide where we're at and did you know chapter 15 of the
seven Canto is our last chapter here in this Canto we read this very important verse text ate that said that it said that the highest that there's no Dharma Superior to that in which one let's go gives up of any animosity that they might have whether it's in there whether it's expressed or existing within their body within their words or within their mind I don't have it any Anna and Anna Massey right of let it all go there's no Dharma higher than that it's a OK Google mission
 it does have anything to do with the show
I just had to see what's on sale downtown. It might be like that okay so then now we come to text 90 yes
 tell me whenever hitting the topic of the spiritual awakening and eat you all we've been hearing all about the different
 kind of regulations duties that the householders have but when you went now is going to show that in this is something that I never got in my other religious you could say studies are experienced here's the regulations you got to do this you go to hell he was saying all of these regulations that one. I swear you want to call them down tomorrow or what they're meant to to take you somewhere the men to achieve something the men to transform in a particular way in a few transformed in that way
 you actually don't need to follow the name where you pitch eave the goal of them
helps us kind of understand the nature of the regulations that are there in spiritual practice
 text night
 because of an Awakening of spiritual knowledge those who are intelligent in regard to sacrifice who are actually aware of Dharma or religious principles and we're free from Material desires control the self in the fire of spiritual knowledge or knowledge of the absolute truth they may give up the process of ritualistic Ceremonies they make about the processes so there you go you know that this idea this this idea
 it's a couple things I really like in his first real guy that I really like
 I just like this is a topic
 the topic of Spiritual Awakening the moment of Spiritual Awakening I think is a very fascinating topic you know we we see
cross our literature at the I mean can you name some one or two
 moments of Spiritual Awakening
 March break it gets cursed to die when he accepts his death and he searches out a guru tragic situation and he's a real Awakening right kind of lost touch with it and then in that moment, Awakenings are real wakening turning everything over to you and I live very very long lives meaning not even in this life we live our life times and probably to get to this point where the Inn where we realize that the material world is not my home that I meant for God there's nothing of this world that will satisfy my heart not romance not stuff not travel Adventure. Family only
God it seems like that takes many many births and so we probably had lifetimes of a little spiritual bubbles a little spiritual bubble little Smitty spiritual Awakenings and then there's the Maha Spiritual Awakening which is probably our last life that's why I can't get bit sometimes I get a little sad when I hear people get into boxing to get out of baki it's like
 it's not for everybody they're not not the fruit is it takes a lot to be ripe to this type of some patients yet but it takes a long time to be ripe mentally that when you hear spiritual Truth for your like yes yes you have to be at a right place in your mind in your Consciousness in your heart to really digest this stuff
 it's true or else it's just I mean I'm sure you had X you like what you've heard it in
I don't know if I had half a out really I have hot I'll be very Frank I've heard a lot of the spiritual information just so you know know that you're where's a great place what are you guys talking about why are you so negative with your what school has a lot of interesting things to do you guys are being very negative
 and I think that it takes a lot to get to that point where we're actually we have no desires of this world and then from there it takes a lot to really hit that point of Spiritual Awakening where were you know the this I said it's a top of that I'm interested in some of my favorite paintings are like of the moment of Spiritual Awakening I'm going to share a lot sure I did there's a painting I had anticipated it's a painting of a
 you shoot your Tanya that it's really seen you know I haven't seen it around too much but I want to see if I can
the message poor are there we go to in the right there but to me this is his you know this is when he comes back from Gaia he's back another week and the feelings of Rod are Awakening in his heart he's sitting very still and I just put it on the thing did you see it
 door saw the painting yeah it's like it's a real bad in my mind is a very beautiful pain
 you know it's kind of like if you look he's sitting in the Forefront of the painting I think you know those those golden flowers behind I'm kind of represent Radha you know her mood is kind of or is around him
 he's got his hand to his heart and if you look back it's going deep into the forest you know that there's a path even to the force is like he's awake and you know to enter another world you know there's a painting of that I really love of Joan of Arc that's in the metropolitan
seeing what she's having her Spiritual Awakening but it's kind of seemed like all of this spiritual work it's not that we don't benefit from it we don't enjoy it is that play as pleasurable as it's nursing it satisfying from beginning to end if there's the spiritual path
 but there's also a very special about that that moment of Spiritual Awakening you know where or everything lights up the D2 speaks of it that way text 516 Brookhurst and says when however one is enlightened with a knowledge by which nations' destroyed then their knowledge reveals everything is the sun lights up everything in the daytime but we're like there's no longer if there's those nagging kind of illusory attachments misconceptions that we hang on to you know what you speak of resentments and things like that
 that is how it is gone
and then we realize that all of these rules and regulations they were meant to get you somewhere you know they were there weren't wasn't it wasn't a punishment a lot of times at least of the abrahamic Traditions it's almost seemed as a punishment you will get a punishment for bad behavior your sinful is now you must do this Penance it's all in it it's like an instruction booklet that came with the that came with the device you just purchased how not to wreck your device and what to do to enhance your device you got to charge it like this and then you've got it in a cleaning with this need to change the batteries like this so if I take my cell phone and I don't even know what that meant my smartphone start smashing at all right you know you go swimming with it now you're going to ruin it that's what so it's not like God's punishing you and ruining your cell phone you ruined it you
your work that you take responsibility you've made some dumb choice and you've wrecked your phone now God's not punishing you for that. The Vedas come to give us instructions good advice so that we can just live in this world and then metaphysical advice we can transcend this world don't blame God that's not punishing God is love that's a different concept of God is this one thing your dad's gives you a punishment might go to your room come down for dinner so the thing of God punishes go to your room destic God that we've created that God is not love goddess speight who wants to fall in love with that God it's like a it's like living under like a dictatorship
 just rules in this world there's rules in this world and it in The Vedas come to teach us how to best utilize the machine we are born into
conclude our subtle machine or mine or intelligence our ego and then had to transcend the body when it wants its transcended then and I want to be clear I'm not worried about the practices of box do you like hearing a chanting and so on those that their means and an end but they're certain regulations that are means right. Not so much the answer there for like in the in the Gita in the third chapter Krishna says that for one who takes pleasure in the South right it's all internal their their happiness is found within the water takes pleasure in the in the in the South and whose life is one of self-realization
 and who satisfied in a cell phone Lee right I don't need anything extra and I'm satisfied just experienced in my own inner Blissful spiritual nature fully satiated
 for them there's no Duty that's probably keep the 4th
there's no Duty person who's who's really got that you do I read this letter I came across this letter the other day running. There's a little problem bud Road
 to the voting in Bhagavad Nunda
 did 1972 and it sounds like he's responding to this devotee kind of like complaining about the circumstances that were going on
 let me read this to you I think it might find it inspiring okay
 so just please accept my blessings I've received your letter from Pittsburgh date of July 3rd 1972
 one thing is our process of Krishna Consciousness is process a bucket if it is followed with determination and enthusiasm
 automatically it has the effect of fixing us body mind and soul
 at the Lotus feet of Lord Krishna so that all sorts of fluctuate
nations of the material nature all sorts of difficulties and discrepancies of Life are easily withstood and there's so much truth in this I know you've experienced it yourself or not yeah but first you have to agree to understand the process and follow it scrupulously that is wanting
 if I only think I know something
 if I only think I know something that is the mental platform of accept and reject and any knowledge gathered from the mental platform is like that tottering and precarious and it could be immediately rejected any time like these I spiritual ideas and my kind of except in my mind
 but they haven't become part of me to have been realized it so they can be just as the mind is always going this way that way just like you were saying a moment ago right you you might have feelings of like no
squirrel this applies to be enjoyed you know you can you can swing back and forth he says goes on Krishna Consciousness has great potency to deliver us to the highest platform of infection but only if it is understood by the intelligence okay now he's so now he's draw a distinction between the Manas the like and dislike app of the mind and then the intelligence right there though the reasoning my it a sap of the might of the mind this is Krishna Consciousness has great potency Deliver us to the highest platform of perfection but only if it is understood by the intelligence something understood by the intelligence is fixed forever and cannot waver and that is almost spiritual and he says from your letter I can understand that you're confused in your mind
 because you do not want this you do not want that you might like another like that
 that position of confusion is not very much desirable
so you are a vaishnava now rid yourself of such misunderstanding of things is so good courage enough to step up to that you caught up in Petty things my friend you know you could you could you you're not getting really spiritual until you you get past that vaishnava means and now this is this is great this this is what I really want to highlight here vaishnava means one who's able to sit down anywhere under any conditions and be happy
 he wants only a place to lay down a little purse Adam and if there's a little service you can do gladly let me do it for Krishna that's all
 as long as we're thinking I want this this is not to my liking or if I just things a certain way everything will be better these thoughts are material
 emotional service is not conditional so stop this dreaming state
try to understand things with a light of your intelligence and if you are sincere in this way without a doubt Krishna will give you full facility to understand him and become freed of the bondage of ignorance
 well good. Just nectar there isn't it just like you know just truth to that we need to hear that we need to reflect on everyday living living in her mind creating problems so when you copy on that like like the guitar Singh for one who takes pleasure in itself right I can sit down anywhere I don't need you know any I don't need to change all the services for one or takes pleasure in the South and whose human life is one of self realization and it was satisfied in the South only fully satiated for them there's no do today can let go of all of this you know so that gets back to her or verse for today or they can give out the process of ritualistic ceremonies
 text 10
upon seeing the person engaged in performance the sacrifice animals meant to be sacrificed or extremely afraid thinking this merciless performer sacrifices being ignorant of the purpose of the sacrifice and being most satisfied but killing others will surely kill us thinking a lot these animals
 therefore day by day one who is actually aware of religious principles and is not heinously envious of or animals should happily perform daily sacrifices and those for certain occasions with whatever food is available easily by the grace of the Lord
 they're five branches of adharma or a religion
 appropriately known as the Dharma Dharma me religion religious principles for which one is on fit on a Dharma, let's not do we can
is with pretentious religion know that the shadow of a true Dharma pretentious
 analogical religion orphan.
 Analogical is none not logical and illogical against logic or it's just logical Hoopa Dorma Opera that that if I understand it correctly Lupa
 it can be something that's close like a new punishes to sit close or can also be like it's not really something like it's it's close to something but it's not really it you know like like I said like a a lake is called a pack or
 Anna Anna Pond is called Abu Bakr like it's not really late but it's something like a
it's less than like you know close to a lake near Lake Mary
 having trouble finding it but it looks like it's based on the analogy
 the same root word in a logical
 of relating to her based on analogy expressing are implying analogy
 she just quick Marin you got to be that up 22 was on that like 5 minutes ago
 please continue running
 sorry if I hurt your feelings Monday everybody gets a break today and of course there is cheating religion or Cella Dharma what it was aware of real religious life must have been at least five a religious these five as a religious religious principles and obstructing one from following religious principles that obstruction house going to explain it
I guess his own religion are called The V Dharma religious principles introduced by others all are called how to Dharma a new type of religion created by one who is falsely proud I do opposing the principles of The Vedas is called Lupa Dharma and Inter and interpretation by one's juggle re of words
 is called challedon, he's a pretentious pretentious religious system manufactured by one who willfully neglect the prescribed duties of his order of life is called a basa about a Bossa Bossa dim reflection of or false similar but if one performs the prescribed duties for his particular ashram Urbana why are they not sufficient to mitigate all material distress even if a pore even if a man has poor you should not endeavor
through this economic condition just to maintain his body and soul together and try this again even if I managed to pour cold what one moment cuz I think what was that all about all of these
 kind of phony dharma's you know misapplied ideas of what Dharma is we can analyze using a proper does a bit in the commentaries and and the other commentators go deeper into that I think just what
 one aspect of what's important about it
 is that when people come to Eastern thought from the from the Western World or from the abrahamic religions
 I think most commonly part of it has to do at least part of it it made largely have to do with a reaction to the sectarian nature
of Western religions we're right in everybody's wrong so we kind of find find it appealing that here's a tradition that sang hey there's truth in all Traditions don't be so sectarian be broader see truth everywhere cetera and that's a good thing but even that has to be tempered right and Emmett and I I see kind of like a an inconsistency in this world like a person from the Western World will have the one that come over to 2
 Hinduism or snot and armor whatever you wanna call it they're kind of like don't no one there should be no discernment that you know everything is good over here you know what you know whatever someone's teaching your Duality over here Castilla whereas they would never tolerate the same thing from the say a Christian church right like the kind of hypocrisies that they would point that they would eagerly point out in a Christian Church they won't point out those same Epocrates when they appear in the Eastern
but they're they're the definitely they're there. There's always going to be people that are going to take any good thing
 and misuse it misapply it twisted you know for their own purposes due to their own weaknesses or their own warped desires and so it's saying that hey what's in this world you know when artists and I'm laying out all this information about darmont how can be followed but there's going to be people there's going to be people that twisted or misapplied or contaminated pollute it you know in different ways you should be aware of that you know you should discern that don't don't just say always all good it's all one it doesn't matter if you no no no don't give up your your discernment
 and I think we can jump into text 15 tomorrow yeah
 Miss Mara
