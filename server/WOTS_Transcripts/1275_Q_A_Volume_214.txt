 live from beautiful Tampa Florida this is wisdom of the ages of DeLeo the podcast with your host Rockin off and co-host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York Mystic a stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome to Tampa Florida where he would live with Miss Mara and Linda Linda Linda and the rest of the Youth of today guys are sleeping
 Tampa is a beautiful city
 I know I know I know you live here every time I come to one of these places and was like what am I doing legend of the Jungle their house in Upstate New York there's actually people and things to do in the city instead of just

 Chipmunks
 how are you guys doing how's your re-entry now going really well happy to be back in back in the groove going to divya's Kitchen I went the other day I made him go today who knows how is the concert was the show last night basket civilian was our first hardcore show hi Linda how are you everybody know Linda Linda Linda I think first then do we need to know what kind of music would you normally listen to well I mean really it's pretty much only cared on these days but I like to listen to some 80's music for what what are you listening to whatever the 80s hits on the streaming services
in the car mainly is where I would listen to non kirtan music so yeah but when I was young my son's father was in a like heavy metal band so it's not a plot twist so it wasn't a wild departure from places I've been before but it's I never thought 30 years later I would listen to that kind of music again but it was honestly amazing I could not stop smiling first of all it's it's like one of Rocket ask your sunglasses because all the things he talks about are the same things like positive mental attitude like control your thoughts all of those things it really surprised me because I looked at the crowd and I thought there's no way these guys are going to be into this but they were they were like clapping and yelling and encouraging him and people came up to him after saying you're really changing people's lives
it was amazing and the energy is incredible and he took two cases of his books and sold every single one and if he had had more he would have sold more so that two cases stroganoff

 I want to Dive Right In probably I'm ready this is Michael via email so he wrote during the email I'm in other and other means person who doesn't watch on Zoom so if they're out there listening but we don't know they're there seems like most of our people will be others but we do have a big handful of people to watch this on Zoom also you can write me or if you want the secret codes to get on to zoom I'm in the other and I've been listening mostly daily for about a year now and subscribed subscribed to Patriot about 6 months ago and can't really find the words to convey the appreciation I feel for the work for all y'all that all that y'all do okay thank you the way that Michael might be from the south
very much and thanks for your country either your monthly contribution on patreon I was raised Italian Catholic check but the worldview found within that face never made much sense to me but I had but I had and have a love for Jesus Mary and the Saints
 in my later years I started learning about traditional Eastern worldviews mostly Buddhist and so much of what I learned made sense to me rebirth being eat rebirth being Eternal beings the law of karma etcetera just made sense to me as I learned about them and I didn't need to be convinced to start a click together we always say that this is the show many wisdoms or nuggets of wisdom in all these spiritual Traditions that we find Vedic cultural to be the string or the thread that ties all these Pearls of Wisdom together
doesn't recognize a personal God that was a tough one for me too but when I came across your podcast that talks about a more traditional Eastern worldview that's that made sense to me for decades and 49 I recognize God which Buddhism to glueck's I felt ecstatic all that said there's one problem I found myself with is basically love Jesus and the Saints but can't call myself a Catholic is this a problem or is it in that I think is kind of nature the question did you leave a disagreement
 with much of the worldview and it's all that said one problem perhaps I found with it I found myself with is I basically love Jesus in the Saints but can't call myself a Catholic due to a disagreement with much of the worldview and its philosophy Bible
if that I've been learning about Krishna and the worldview found within the human body of a time or at least think yeah maybe at some parts but my heart isn't tugged so strongly by the personal stories I've been chanting rounds of the Muhammad your daily semi-regularly attend kirtan followed by a study group on the bhagavad-gita at my local iskcon and stay when they offer the incense to the deities and I genuinely feel a love for these things in a way I feel the situation I find myself in is more about familiarity than anything else and if I was raised with stories and imagery of Krishna my heart would possibly be stirred more
 buy them then by the stories of Jesus I'm not implying that I think Faith only comes down to social conditioning but the
familiar arity that comes with one social setting does play a role to a degree and I'm not just sure how do you have my heart stirred as much if not more by Krishna as it is by Jesus be westerners yourselves who I believe may have been raised Catholic do you have any advice or suggestions for people like me who have some hard hard feelings for Jesus in the Saints but don't intellectually agree with that Faith while also feeling some smaller Hearts during and basically full intellectual agreement with Eastern bhakti as presented by the srimad bhagavatam and wisdom of the sages think of your time and all of the work that you do
 I like this question do you yeah
 dim the lights
 all right when you take a shot at this first my friend and I'll write Michael
 how do you sound so far to Sunday sub Michael saying you know my
head is into shouldn't bother with Tom in the bucket tradition of ancient India and my heart is still connected to the Catholic unit to the to the DDS of the images for the stories and so on that he feels an emotional heart connection to Jesus into Marion to various Christian Saints
 and is that a problem it I guess it and I guess it's kind of sound like how come my heart isn't lighting up in the same way for this as it does for the doll stuff maybe some air conditioning right maybe it's just the way that I was raised and it's probably Fair now sits but what I really want to start with is to say that there's really not a problem here if you have a love for Jesus and a love for Mary and love for the Christian sayings like a caste Frances or something like that
 they're what they're presenting with the
the essence of what they're teaching the with the essence of what they embody and represent is very harmonious with the bucket tradition in that sense there's there's no there's no problem this is a very personal consideration you know this is this is
 something you can't exactly legislate what goes on in someone's heart we can say to stop loving Jesus start loving Krishna your heart is going there in and that's you know as about to Yogi's a lot of the practice is being careful about where we allow our minds and our hearts
 to dwell you could send and if we feel our mind and in our heart being pulled in two places you know like in a sense the quote-unquote idolatry of the material worlds you know I seem to love this football player in this Popstar so much
that could be problematic and I like I'm attracted to the material energy I'm attracted to the illusion my heart is going out to the illusion but if your heart is going out to Jesus well that's a whole nother thing that's Jesus is it is a living model of bhakti yoga as far as we're concerned and so that's not disharmonists it it it's it's not hard to harmonious it's some it's a beautiful thing you know there's there's a
 in chickens or cheap Chinese Lila you know there is one story about he had won it with an advice you have a community within that Community Buck to Yogi's among his followers as one named murari Gupta
 and he had a note route a tiny he was teaching you know the love of the resort and residence for Radha and Krishna is the very pinnacle
 of all spiritual
realization is the highest meditation says it's the deepest love the most beautiful I love being being you know the very Pinnacle of divine love is can be found there and that the whole Community was moving in that direction but one member that Community where are you go to no matter how hard he tried he just felt he had this love for a lord ROM instead of Krishna I love how you brought this story and I've been trying and trying to tell us in a sense let go of my love for Lord ROM
 nmn allow my focus to be on Broad and Krishna
 I just can't do it I just can't do it and she tell you actually appreciated that right he says look at your love for Lord Rob this is you know this is a glorified that love
and you basically said you bu bu yeah yeah yeah and so all that so having said all that let your love for Jesus and Mary and the Saints let it remain let it flourish it will not hold you back in any way it is going to answer your life but then and I will say that I say that wholeheartedly
 you know this isn't about Allegiance this is about the substance of devotion your heart that's that's important but let me say this is well I do think that you may have been onto something when you were speaking about the role of social conditioning
 and I think the character of Krishna
 for some coming from another that are coming from another tradition it may be something that you're hard wrestles with for a while
 to really understand who
Edison y behaves the way he does but I would just say this Michael just keep your heart open
 keep your heart open and read krishna's Lila's and in the Christian book hear about them you know in from other sources and allow whatever is meant to happen to your odd happened and it may be a gradual process but this is what I'm saying I don't want you to close your heart to Jesus and Mary and the Saints Christian Saints leave your heart opens that wholeheartedly open to that right at the same time don't don't assume
 that there's not a seed in your heart of love for Krishna that the blue coward boy who roam the forest with his cows and his friends who's the killer sm-2 Morty the sweet sweet sweet lover of the gopis
a friend of the Cowboys a darling mother showed in Nunda the beauty in this is there waiting for you or you or maybe you're waiting for it but the two may come together or made germinate at a certain time and you as long as you leave your heart open to it and a most wonderful way so just that's that's my thought just and leave your heart open to Jesus and keep it open to Christian to and let's see what What miracles may take place I think that was everything I would have said if I could add one little thing or embellish one thing that you mentioned was in a lot of college a lot of other abrahamic you know Traditions the idea of now I'm going to okay I I believe in this I believe in my God but now I'm going to do an experiment with this other God it would be considered heresy we don't think like that Daddy culture doesn't think like that
it's not like I'm cheating on my wife to have an another lover there's one God we fully accept that you can go to the church and pray to Jesus there's nothing outside what we do to say that's wrong we think that's very very right and I to have a traction towards I have an attraction towards like you know that church organ read out that during Christmas time and singing all those songs I said love them I'm totally into on Christmas I'm playing tons of Christmas music or you know classical Christmas playlist since and things like a specially all the old classical ones and
 stuff like that I'm all about that and I don't feel like I'm being unchaste tubes baby Krishna not at all and I will say Artie in the offering of the enzymes in the ring of the Bells it it seem foreign to me
and krishna's pastimes okay now Chris is going to punch the donkey demon right in the throat or the horse demon was like I never heard of any donkeys horses are duck demons but yeah you will develop an affection for that believe it or not and it and you can and you can pray to Jesus help me develop my affection we are culturally conditioned also and we were brought up in another culture and to open our heart in such a way so get God where we can get God we were not getting a kickback from the Harry Krishna movement to convert people here find spirit in your life applied to your life and move forward and I will say and you probably are living this
 that's a knot under armour approach to understanding God it will resonate with everything within your heart because it is it is so complete and a ties these Pearls of Wisdom all together
and you shouldn't have to feel guilty about appreciating other cultures path to God that's what we should be able to walk into a mosque or synagogue in ashram or at any type of tampons at how nice they're trying to imbibe truth in their life and it tried to let you know upgrade their life that's a good thing that's a wonderful thing
 that is all thank you
 oh no worries. Yeah this is coming from a shooter at YouTube via the Discord channels
 he writes how can we tell the difference between satisfaction happiness and peace
 stemming from the mode of goodness
 and that from actual spiritual advancement
 when we practice we change your habits for the better like getting up early
be more clean doing yoga meditating eating Pure Foods Etc
 coming into the mode of goodness we experience satisfaction
 it might be easy to mistake the pleasure from being in the mode of goodness for making spiritual advancement so is there a difference between the two and how to discern the right question I asked a question once the site garage
 is the answer he gave me I also answered in terms of how do you know you're just how do you know you're just not like tricking yourself into I'm spiritual but you know in the same way someone who's a Christian that might say you know I love Jesus I feel the love for Jesus and they absolutely think they're right and I feel good about it and because they're on a path or any path they feel good about it and therefore it feel like yeah I know it's God talk
and how do I know I'm just not fix like I'm a Harry Krishna devotee and I feel good about that and all this world is Maya anyway to any way to sort of like Pat me my send you get some pleasure out of feeling like you're on a path so hear you saying yeah or doing this practice is upset that I had to let you know it's just not the pleasure of sattva motive goodness which is regulation in and cleanliness like you mentioned Rising early how do you know it's not that I need to certain between that and actually falling in love with God and the answer is at least would start your eyes gave me and I think to be true also is
 there's truth in it there's truth in both of them you do get Pleasures from being sucked Vic and you do get Pleasures from feeling like okay now I'm on a path
 and it's going to be mixed it's going to be mixed with a sattva kickback
 and a focus Kick Back by
focused and mentally focused being on a path and some attraction to Krishna and one way you can discern is how eager you are to be attracted to Krishna do you want to hear about Christian chat about Christian saying about Christian and read about Krishna and Worship Christian that's one of the telltale signs
 we always have this joke if you want to get rid of someone who's bothering you you go up to the Missy why don't we sit down together and if they did have no attraction to it whatsoever that cuz there they just want to talk for Joppa or just waste your time with empty talk they'll be repelled from hearing the bug of agita but if he's actually not that attraction to the Gita or the hearing spiritual truth that's a sign of your attachment to God as well so I expect a pleasure and don't hate yourself for that pleasure don't don't beat yourself up how do I know this is real just keep moving phone
with those practices and the attachment for Krishna will naturally come
 that's my answer what do you think about that I do not agree with you maybe just a little background information for some of the listeners you know we're talking here about the what's in the bug of agita and other ancient Indian yoga books call Laguna's the three modes material nature I heard an interesting way of understanding it recently is like the like um I suppose a television screen serve video screens there you know they use three different colors what is RGB is that what it is red green blue and so those it's just those three colors but those three colors they come together in different combinations
 and they create a whole spectrum of of
 Hill Vision
an insult simerly there's three modes of nature there's three ingredients within the material energy that makes up the world that we live in including our bodies and even our minds so and it's made up of these three different elements subfer which sometimes is translated goodness and purity
 grudges which is we call it passion but really it has to do with
 more like um agitation you don't need anything and I need something they don't have and Thomas which is a darkroom oh Gina sometimes it's translate his darkness and ignorance that every everything that we're seeing and hearing and spelling and touching and whatever it's is built of a combination of these elements just like our screens these these three elements come together in a screens and create different pictures these three energies are coming together and creating all the forms within this world that we are experiencing
one of those three in every object becomes prominent
 and that object kind of radiates the influence of that and so there's there's a kind of a distinct dissatisfaction in the influence of both Rodger and Rodger going as like I don't have what I need I'm determined to get it and Thomas is more like everything's terrible life is misery and you know it's a very destructive and self-destructive kind of commode but the suck for gonna
 the mode of goodness this mode of purity
 88 manifest in this world through Lucid thought through contentment through peace
 and so that when one lives
 in the under the influence in the shelter that influence you to say in this world
 and you know stare typically we could go ahead and picture you know I live in a very natural setting on the bank of a lake and you know it is birds chirping and
eating healthy food and you know I am Rising early and I got a clear head and I'm contemplatively these kind of things these are manifestations of that of the influence of sulfur and so chew to saying yeah when you get into that naturally you feel a sense of Happiness a sense of satisfaction a sense of Peace inside
 but could it but isn't it that that sense of peace is still just an absorption in the material realm and we really haven't even begun to know spirituality yet what's the speed of the deep happiness of spirituality so we would feel that if I'm becoming happier I must be doing something right right but have I even really
 approach the transcendental plant have I really begun to free myself and maybe free myself is the kind of language that did it helps egg weigh in
he knows it it one could say that if this world is a prison in one sentence and these ancient yoga text to speak of it that way then one really begins to manipulate the world could say in such a way where they're taking shelter of that suck puguna
 in one sense it just like you found yourself the most comfortable and nicest place within the prison and put used to having step one foot out of that prison and really enjoyed true Freedom yet
 and so that's the point so now what's the difference how do we know what the difference is you could say essentially the differences
 it is in this is really
 this is you know I just read this funny I just read a quote I came across a quote
 maybe I can pull it up quick cuz I just I just did it I just saw it
this morning
 how do you say who it's from
 but it's from one of these big-time
 you know Cortana call Guru figures he said remember
 remember freedom is a higher value Than Love
 that's why in India the ultimate we call Moksha
 right options Liberation not everybody calls not everyone in the know love is the highest Pittsburgh this is Moksha means freedom freedom is a higher value than love so if love is destroying Freedom it is not worth it is not of worth
 oh so if I'm a mother and I love my child but the child's kind of messing with my freedom
I'll take away all my freedom now I can't go to my spinning and yoga class but you know is it a higher value you don't to me actually even though that sounds like that's Freedom ffreedom it all your bound that that you are bound by your desires your Bound by a false sense of Freedom real freedom is found in love complete freedom but anyway without getting it the whole you know nuanced kind of argument against that statement
 here's here's how I would identify the distinction between the happiness found in several going in the happiness found in in in true spirituality or invati
 is that the happiness found that's in the mirror saguna is selfish it's it's it's like my only concern is my experience and its separate
but it sometimes our charge will call it a separatist attitude I am separate from my source I'm disconnected from my soreness I want peace and I'm going to find my peace and leave me alone like that spiritual happiness is found through Divine love and it takes. You know our acharya is teaching or shorts he said this is the very essence of the self that we go down to our core what we find is a lover right and a Lover's always concerned about the experience of the object of their love
 so that happiness is man if you just think of yourself as being happy temporarily on an island all by yourself cuz you found your peace as compared to the love that you experienced in the most intimate in special ways that you find a connection with one that you love the spiritual happiness is like that with God and through God with every living being
I think that's a sent you that it was not that's not too to talk down supper Guna because set for going to gives us the Lucidity the clear Lucid mind the Detachment is so on to
 aggressively we could say or wholeheartedly approach the practice is about to be in the teachings of Don t understand them clearly and have the the you can say the Peace of Mind
 to focus the mind on on that object of our love so we we appreciate said we're gonna we encourage people to live in Suffolk gonna We also occurs because I said that's not the goal that's just the platform from what you launched toward the goal in the gold is found in Divine love
 that's in connection with another living being that's entirely selfless
 I would have loved to see your face when you read that quote
Liberation is higher than love you know I've got a great check this out understanding a three gunas with music with music check this out motive goodness Mozart Chopin Bach
 more passion Gorilla Biscuits youth of today Minor Threat motive ignorance Cannibal Corpse Insane Clown Posse bituary Cannibal Corpse from that music scene going I totally get it now I'm completely understand the 303 gunas and who is supposed to come from this is from
Michael be a Discord mic was a Discord
 no hero. Even so try different mine was a couple Michael's Out There Our Generation everybody was Michael my goal John David now everyone's like
 Autumn Latin Liam Liam Williams and then 10 modern names Olivia river river is Autumn Lake Dam
 after okay what's Michael asking about with the upcoming solar eclipse in April
 must be the significance of solar eclipses
tradition what actions can be taken to divert any negative forces that may come with it thank you now again meteor showers I am there's a quote that I want to read I hope I can find it I hope the window is still open on it but I know that you could spend a long time to talk about this subject plenty of time to find it. The only thing I would say about it it's one of those things like in America we find these like Celestial movements we think Alex fascinating let's lay on the grass and look up in the sky and look for the eclipse or I heard there's a meteorite shower at 1 a.m. this morning let's lay on the back and then her backyard and look up at the sky
 these are all inauspicious things are considered inauspicious it's rahu they say is becoming manifest and rahu is got inauspicious
effects on us and Laura Catania appeared during an eclipse because usually in India during the eclipse everyone goes to the sacred rivers or stays inside so the Moon Shadow does not affect go on the body or they go to the holy rivers in bathing the rivers and they just chant Krishna Krishna their lord's name Vishnu Vishnu is a large Italia specifically claimed during the eclipse of the full moon because he knew everybody would be champing so in that chanting they say everybody was chanting even atheists or or that with that people aren't going to help because this means trouble for everybody
 okay what do you want what do you what do you say I found what I was looking for so this is from srimad bhagavatam
 Canto 6 chapter 8 text 27 and 28
 and I found this
you know about preface reading this by sharing that down things like what Michael's bringing up eclipses
 the influence of the planets different something malefic planets things that made bring dark
 segments of our life you know into our purview or what if he knows like
 there's an altar inauspicious things that we may come across in life there's a whole science of understanding how these things work and in the teachings they get into definitely astrology like
 a very refined powerful signs of astrology and things like palm reading with their you do all of these things have their cheap invitations in in ridiculous
I think they're kind of mockery is practically a mockery of these things a lot of stuff that we come across that doesn't mean that there were precise science is about this and there are so it can be palmistry you can be astrology and it in so many almonds readable reading a Bowman's Ricky almonds rituals and so on its all there
 the one you come to the stage of bhakti
 you understand that behind all of that science
 is all the signs of understanding the energies
 of Krishna it how they manifest in this world
 and so there is an interested in it and even there can be a Fascination in it
 but our real Fascination is not lost in how it manifests in the material world is the real Fascination is the person behind it all
and if this world is a virtual reality in a sentence
 we could get very caught up in the fascinating way that this virtual reality is programmed and they're certainly an interesting that but the interest for the but the oak is always in it always goes back to the song of a car in a car in the cause of all causes the programmer behind it from home it all stems
 and with the understanding that we have an eternal loving relationship with that being and that loving relationship
 all of the all of the shifting in this world and all of the karma that plays out in our lives
 represented in or influenced by
 these planets in these very simple dances
 is all designed for one purpose
and that is a we turn ourselves back to that and and take shelter with love in our hearts
 to that program or behind at all you know I always like to say that I believe the very the very Apex you know of or the climax whatever you want to call of the of all of yesterday's literature of The Vedas and you punished odds in the itty Hoss's Mahabharata the piranhas They all built to the bottom of time will we get to clear to most direct message and the conclusion in the literally is called the cream of the cream of all the vehicle Chargers and that builds and builds and builds and take it to the 10th 10th cancel just like the cream of the cream of the Creeps and then the rest of the right of the very Pinnacle of all creation with the greatest Yogi's of all copies
 United Air meditation on the Divine truth is
deeper and with the deepest most purest beautiful sentiments in the in the hearts and minds of these yoga knees that the co-op's and the Pinnacle is when Christian plays his food and you know the last place I visited run off a diving
 yet the last morning I was there I wouldn't have the full day there where do the walleye in the morning I I was somehow I just got the inspiration I'm going to sit in my room
 and I'm going to I'm going to just start going through different vaishnava songs and I was singing the songs and reading the meanings of them
 that's a nice thing to do was wonderful it was wonderful for you go anywhere you just stay put no I went somewhere cuz then I sang the song jiya re jiya re friends of David maximum Rita
 and and then I came to that case she gotta donk savotta so you like I'm gone
AMC bought the tree under which Krishna student play this flu calling the gold piece so I went down first I went to go prepare Mahadev Temple it was great it was happening which is the temples where we go to to to pray to Lord Shiva maybe you can briefly describe what she was rolling all this or choose the gatekeeper is the gatekeeper to enter into of the rasa Lila wanted to enter the residence but he could give me to mail form wasn't welcome so one of krishna's Gopi said you know what you really got to take a bath you got really got to change to a male female form seems like how am I supposed to do that because you take a bath and want us to roll bro and see what happens Texas bappy comes out as a beautiful Cowherd girl wrapped in a sari
 and then he just sort of like
 meandered into the rasa Lila started dancing and then Chris
immediately felt like something is wrong today something is wrong and he called for the lead in the Shaka there's something up today are all these girls are all these girl who are these girls here find out where they're from so they went to each girl where you from what is your name what is your village who is your father and they're all giving you know very they came to see that she was completely covered from cell phone I'm just a little girl here
 and then he called me back and they said Krishna everything's normal I don't know what you're talkin about I don't know what is your what is your gut feeling here today Krishna it's just there's there is a new girl here so young girl from a local Village she has a third eye on her forehead and a snake around her neck otherwise everything's completely the same that was not the that's it that's the Lord Shiva takes that form gopesh part of my day he's his guards who's allowed into that
 Arena so before we
it's a diamond at all but also to punxsy but which is just down the you know just down the block you do you go when you pray to Lord Shiva has go get your mind if I went there and then I went to go see if I can I have a wonderful wonderful time there is my last place I saw a nominated but they are Christian place that food in the gopis they come running that these are the greatest show is the ones that are most in touch with reality the ones our most deeply absorbed in reality and in that reality that being the Supreme truth SRI Krishna so they ultimately their hearts and their minds they're ready to sacrifice it all just to satisfy that program or who's behind everything that SRI Krishna you know and when you do that it's all auspicious when you give your mind and you give your heart no matter what your planets are no matter what the lines in your hand are no no matter what meteors are flying around or what other inauspicious Omens are taking place
it's entirely auspicious when you remember Christian what is it what kind of thing the Versa
 oh map of it drop a victory over in a one who remembers the low decide Lord you know everything becomes pure everything becomes suspicious so this is the verse that kind of gets to the heart of that this is Again Barbra Tom's 68 2728
 May the glorification of the transcendental name form qualities and paraphernalia of the Supreme personality of godhead
 protect us that protect us right from the influence of bad planets
 meteors meteors are considered very good submit made the glorification of the transmittal name form qualities and paraphernalia of shriek
may they protect us from the influence of bad planets meteors envious human beings you know who got a little doll and they're sticking a needle in the finger under the stupid to put in a match under the stupid doll feet and human beings serpents and that's a problem especially here in Florida near Aksarben issue scorpions problem animals like tigers and wolves protect us from ghosts
 this problem I know this whole conversation the whole time I was thinking about what about goes what about the opening back up not that the holy name is more powerful than goes but other people are so it got so much
 sometimes people possessed what is where they do it's like that the it's almost like possession seems stronger than
well it doesn't mean that they'll necessarily be liberated from the ghost what do you think this is the highest protection right and no doubt but sometimes they don't sometimes the ghost is so strong and have faith Rosa. I have faith I have faith apparently I'm up the hill I really do but both my legs are broken you know what I mean
 why I understand what is one of the broken because the possession is so strong it is it kill sometimes maybe the desire
 I don't know I've been struggling with this now. No need to struggle right now. Can't that name with full faith may protect us from ghosts and the material elements like earth water fire and Air
and they'd also protect us from lightning
 just covering all the bases here and our past sins right rather than worrying about doing some ritual to counteract or our past inauspicious actions worrying about, that's going to come our way you just give yourself to the glorification of the name form qualities of Christian is it therefore we are always afraid of these hindrances to our spacious life therefore may they all be completely destroyed
 by the chanting of the Hari Krishna maha-mantra so you know to me that this is always that the real Essence right this is is there's any Clips what do we do we can't there's a meteor coming our way we can I feel like I'm I've got some bad
you're rolling through my life take Crazy Glue you can use it for everything and having a holy name is it's perfect for every situation and you just like those gold piece who they want Krishna play that flute on your phone to see what they all had like these lives and responsibilities and shelters you could say that they nearly ran from
 they merely laughed you know they had they had family members saying if you lead you don't go running out to be with that Krishna if you go
 don't even come back but the love in their heart was so strong that when that flute enter their ears and went to the heart they could not help but run
 and they ran out to Christian Christian kind of tease them
 what are you doing here this isn't right coming out in the middle of the night he was some boy on the forest
look for some kind of tigers around out here it's bad you left your family came here yeah I know you should go back go back to your homes go back to your Dharma you're all of the duties that you have in life and the shelters that you have my face it now
 you know since you were this is none of that is what gives us happiness all we want live with tears in their eyes
 all we want
 I serve you with love please accept us please accept our service that's what it's the malefic planets the wolves in the tire the battle home is it and everything else that this is your world is programmed with is all to bring us to that point where we stand before Christmas with tears in her eyes and say I've tried everything none of it works all I want is to serve you with love now please accept me as your servant you know and went in went in one one crazy with that kind of them sincerity than Krishna dances with you than Christian braces you
I and Love and You end it all of that illusion of this world disappears so that's you know since all of that is kind of here in this the glorification of the Trans Am named form koalas and paraphernalia of Krishna that will protect us from the influence of bad plants meteors and he's human circuit scorpion everything you know which a everything we keep it simple we keep still keep the main thing the main thing of it are having a tough time you can have a bad dream Chan going through some hell in your life you have a great day you chance things are looking up falling in love chant that will destroy everything in auspicious in our life we should have that strong face now that Trump doesn't mean
 that you don't sometimes you know cover our bases and stuff like that or whatever in practical in this world but ultimately this is where faith is
cuz that's where I would leave it to Michael
 I got a split running I got forced to teach online no do you I do and I know you're busy man over there too
 what do you think about that music understanding The Goonies with music Clown Posse shirt in the Delhi airport knows she suck big looking know she's temasek looking away but you know that's definitely had that temasek black lipstick predict an airliner that doesn't mean that the corpse is a cannibal and it's going on eating humans or does it mean that
