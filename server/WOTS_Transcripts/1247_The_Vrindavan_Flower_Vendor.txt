cool pictures of pictures of Krishna
 I'm a good friend to sever ties to my life that is beautiful and it is a point how does a caucus work
 they have to post a picture of the most beautiful picture Christian me and Mary are going to pick how come I don't get to pick you weren't around in the future

they're going to pickle what if you disagree
 but I want to say I look at these cool earrings I got from them be like this Wednesday I can't see it no that's it, they're both conscious and chakra 16 inch
 this is the chakra look it up it's an offense to buy a physical fall with a vaishnava you know that I don't think it's a defense to find the fault I think that fence if you judge them based on the fault
 so you're saying you have every legitimate reason to make fun of my right ear to say it's true. They haven't made fun of it I just pointed out that it is drooping
Deputy droop along for the show star it wasn't you it was that is not you I'm not the earlobe there you go anyway I like the new earrings thank you very much move on with the show we got a nugget of the want to check on there and see if she's got an answer and health of Kane members at 10:30 today at 6:36 weather in the show 6:30 right cuz it's Saturday
 good morning 8 a.m.
sending question is just something I saw like on Instagram and it just impressive you move me
 let me read it again
 I don't know if we're proud. Went to explain okay. Look at this cuz the photograph that accompanies what she wrote is really nice now I'm not sure I think she may be from London
 but that she's like a
and she's this that you know that the place of Christmas Past Time
 buy so many consider to be the answer she's living there and she's part of her daily routine routine every morning she's going to the flower Walla right to the flower salesman to collect some flowers that she's bringing that or someone to do at to use as part of their project their worship of Krishna their daily worship prayers to the Daily ritual meditation that they do on Krishna Krishna which involves offering flowers so every morning she is going to meeting this gentleman who runs the who runs the man who sells the flowers and sewing up
outdoor stamps and it's a photo of her with this man
 this man is beautiful man right he's just got a he's glowing he's got a big big nice mustache there he's in he's just he's just has the look on his face of someone who doesn't know what anxiety is she doesn't you know what everybody says and then we'll talk about it so she writes this is what I'm at work when weight right so she says while in Russia in the oven are you this sweet flower vendor gave me flowers for the morning worship of a special someone's DD's okay so someone close to her she would go every day and buy deep buy flowers for
 often I didn't have the right change but he would simply give them for free
 it was me and I didn't have the right change but he would just simply give
give them to me for free he used to say that because I was taking the flowers for the Lord that made his work successful his service itself was his success he called me to Tia daughter daughter he told me about his home his wife and sons who also sold flowers near the temple and how his favorite food was quote rotate whatever was lovingly cooked at home that day now that that we can come back to this but we can talk about whatever was lovely cooked at home that I text everyone live a simple life with devotion has his home and it's all he knew all he wanted to know what you said was the outside world to him or Jason flowers from him became part of my daily routine and I look forward to it every day as soon as he saw me approach his stall he would start picking the best flowers big deal about it
take some take some to Los you also take some of the the worst Super Bowl leaves of the Tulsa tree give this book a page out of Rowdy his Deadly Affair was to give others something that they could then offer to the Lord what a position to be and now we have to remember his business
 is selling flowers to people are only using them Worship Christian and so he's giving away his product to his only customers okay so can they can this isn't that you know this is just making enough to get by says now she continues nowadays when Dominick's
with so many people that it's sometimes that it's sometimes difficult to navigate between how things and people up here and who and what they are amongst the crowd we meet the Saints those who teaches that service itself is the payment like that realization and it and when you see the smile on this man's face beautiful and that's a glow that's not something you know he's how old do you think he is worthy 60s but consider this first
 you staying in a town where lots of people get up early in the morning and one of the persons that they do is they go in their purchase some flowers
back into their home that they don't use exactly to decorate their home but they use is part of a meditation and the meditation is it's a ritual that brings your mind to connecting to god and goddess
 in a way that captures captures the mud would like the way that you love a loved one the way that you love her love her that you feel something in that in this daily ritual such a ritual that connected with nature or like I was about to say well I'm a guy but the guys who have flowers in her house but at least my type of guy that would be if I didn't have like Merritt my life that would be flowers my house and have no flowers and flowers that have flowers in my house that every morning I pick some flowers and I offer them and there's some like sensual relationship to the Earth in an offer
ring of love something that your soft beautiful fragrance imagine if the mayor of New York City said for the next month this is this is mandatory that every all of the 12 million people or whatever it is snowing in New York City are required that every morning early you wake up to go out into the street you purchase some flowers you bring the back of your home and then with beautiful prayers and heart and a heartfelt beautiful prayers to Montrose you offer these flowers to God wanting nothing in return
 if everyone did that what what how would it affect the city how would it affect how the people in the sea relate to one another you know
would How would how would we respond it in the different circumstances as we go through the day if everyone took a little time to bring a little beautiful meaningful ritual like this happens in a town like where this girl who this man doesn't know who we could just see as a customer
 he sees her as a daughter she sees him as a father right and and and both of their hearts are kind of like melting when they see each other because they share this connection to that Central Point it's to me that you know again we didn't we talk about this in the past but the ideas of something like the worship of a form like this weave weave
 it's been kind of whether it's through Hollywood and you know
 weather feel like Hollywood
presentations of what primitive ritual looks like or whether it's through judeo Christian or is it Islamic teachings about idol worship
 I never heard any of them articulate well why people do it
 and then you know an address it from that point where is the idea here was that by God is everywhere that's accepted so God can be in this form particularly if it's if it's very intentionally and concentrating on that end and cultivating thoughts in that direction the whole idea is that and then I can go out and see God in the heart of everyone I can see God everywhere so if everyone were actually doing that and doing it with some beautiful flowers needing a sweep
person like this I was encouraging you as you were doing it you know and in so doing it seeing God in all beings that's that's a part of the that's the that's the result of course this can be God and the next thing is and of course everybody's Karen God within your heart then you go and then let's go back to you know what she said
 so she's finding out about his feeling okay and what was his favorite food to eat this is the answer that you get from someone
 YouTube
deeper vibration on a deeper vibrate and he's living a life that's not removed you do from family you don't front from the simple things that people are supposed to appreciate in life right so what what is what is his enjoying this year whatever was lovingly cooked at home that day but it hasn't it has nothing to do with my particular taste or whatever I want to sit with my family cuz it's whatever was lovingly cooked I'll accept that. That means his heart is in line but that's a question right that's how Krishna answers the question for me some good love I'll accept it his heart is a line with Christian is hard but whatever is offered with love that's what I accept you know that I'm happy to accept that
 that's what this practice is all about is just a lying you do we say a lion
heart with the group aligning my heart with God's you know that that there aren't things that I hate that God doesn't hate you right there are things that I love that God doesn't it it's just being lined up like that I can just see it in this man's face in Medford Oregon that's that's Madhuri Ka. 108
 are supposed to respect the supreme law of the author
a shooting that came back from the heart will be going to rain in Kadin I love you service to the Supreme Lord who has praised the transmittal songs will be established as a Sherlock is Chuck Shurley from the unit as my she go to bed and I was born in the darkness of ignorance at their Lotus feet Baton Rouge to my Bob and Tom can do 7 chapter to text 58 I think we can wrap up this chapter chapter 2 today quickly move on to the next chapter before he starts talking look out the window I mean look at our view today it blows my mind trees birds chirping Tulsi that is right on my mantle
we're looking at a big giant massive chakra Temple or largest dome temple in India where the world's largest dome in the world but it might be the second or something but not sure of the Astrodome those don't count today it's just that few minutes ago cuz the sun was just hitting its bright early now the sun start to go down but it was cleaning and so huge and growing everywhere and they speak in Bengali and there's like sweets you've never had before

 thank God we do this live on Zoom as well
okay so what's up show
 text 59-59 after instructing all the foolish relatives are see yah yah yah Mirage in the form of a boy disappeared from their Vision then the relatives of his King Sooyoung performed the richest ritualistic funeral ceremonies by the way me and Mary and jeeva and Catherine just saw a big kirtan going on the back of a pickup truck with a corpse in it they're having a big happy kirtan on room on the way to the ganga after instructor was joyous so after instructing all the foolish relatives of Young Thug
 okay sexy therefore none of you should be aggrieved for the loss of the body whether your own or others only in ignorance does one make bodily distinctions thinking who Am I who are the others what is mine what is Pharrell
that's the wars of the world all created by these Concepts the mother of running cuz you put on hiranyaksha heard the instructions of her any cashew Pooh along with her daughter-in-law Russo Bono Urbano Vasquez wife she forgot her grief over her son's death and thus engaged her mind and attention and understanding the real philosophy of life but you know this previous verse Who Am I who are the others what is mine what belongs to others that question
 the topic it's a little foreshadowing of again what's really going to come out more than anything as we read about dumb
 the teachings of Sri Prasad right who is going to be the son of here and Akashi poo
who's going to say who's who's who's Ernie cuz she was going to try to train him to make these kind of Distinction to see friends and enemies and he's going to he's going to respond by saying I can't even relate to that idea of thinking that way you know he's going to save her. I've heard about people who think that way but I've never experienced it but now I'm experiencing you think in this odd way that their friends in their enemies and it's an odd way to think the title is hrundi kashyap has planned to become a moat texts one said tomorrow is you to steer the demoniac King already has you poo wanted to be unconquered ball and free from old age and dwindling of the body he wanted to gain all the yoga Perfections like anema
to be deathless and to be the only King of the entire universe including from Loca okay it's some major desires there right it's one thing if you say what I want to be the professional baseball player think of you say I want all Misty Perfections I want to be the king of Brahma Loca order the king of the universe well let's talk with his anemia and Leukemia what are they I need my animal I become lighter than may be practically float I need I need mommy's we can make yourself really small I think make sure I'm not sure so he's looking he's he wants to the idea is and it's not just Bob, speaking about this you know if you want to look at the bog with Tom and say oh my God it's just all of these mythical stories
people may say that animals the ability to shrink down one's body
 allows its user to decrease the body weight
 cats getting really big
 sorry, that's also about all that increasing the weight of the body like a hunting property grabbing stuff from other dimensions make things appear in your hand facing
 Amazon allows its user to increase their life length dramatically teleportation ability to live underwater what about mind reading when someone to change the city the Earth will move by the
wish the sky while rain is once the man in the wind will move is his or her sign go out to user to control other people's minds I'm controlling your mind right now so now as I was saying that someone might hear the stories about with, say okay there's a demon he wants become powerful and you got your medical stores to you can't say that about the yoga sutras yoga sutras they're not there's no stories there it's just in-depth mind information for information about how the mind operates two are when you read those you're not picking up some child's fantasy story to teach to teach a philosophical point and it's probably why people even Vedic people say well you know these stories are
to represent things you hear people at the side Guru said that infection exterior I know there is Visa like there is no wrong
 and his followers like all you're a genius but when you read the yoga sutras it's there's no myth stories being tell you may not believe what it's saying sure but it's also getting into it it is by the way it's something that people experiment with them could actually follow an experienced a lot of where it talks about what it was talked about in you I would like two people can go into a trance is an experience it's not an otherwise it's not just like a story. OK Google. Send it like something as simple as yoga asanas there's things I couldn't do with my boss
1016 that I could do very good with my body when I was thirty-eight when people get older you do less with your body but I could do things with my body I can hold my breath longer I could eat if you don't I mean I'm saying yes there is there but there's like a firewall that you can't get through them until you do the practice to get their Shore and end so in people have gone farther have broken down farther barriers sure and done things in their mind and with their mind that that are spoke about the end and the excuse me a text like the yoga sutras speaks about these Mystic Perfections they speak about exactly and then so what's happening in the stories at this powerful influential super powerful super influential character rerun your class AAA just saw his brother get killed he saw his brother get killed by fight by someone that had more power than he had
 and so he was singing How Will I
eventually it surely will. I will need to have greater power than I have now and the way that he saw to do that was your Olga and specifically an aspect of yoga that gives one the Krantz power with his top up which is austerity I so he's what let's read the next person I think of in the valley of mandora Hill around because she began performing his top us worse by standing with his standing with his toes on the ground that's only on his iconic tiptoes that means keeping his arms upward and looking towards the sky so you imagine being under tiptoes how long could you do that for Mary Mary I stand on your tiptoes I think ballerinas have to do it for a long time for this position was extremely difficult but he accepted it as a means to attain how about a year I mean
you're just keep your hand in there for a while just to see how it is very challenging so said he did this to attain Perfection let's see what it says here they've actually got rid of these arms for the sterilization on gusta resting on the ground so he's doing his papa, tapa Supreme Papa it's like very very difficult us fairly do these things that you answer munchers not now let's let's just go to yoga sutras for saying about Healthcare so you got some yoga Sutra I do I mean of course Tapas is mentioned in the yoga sutras and in a couple of important places with me it's mention as part of kriya yoga and then it's also mention is part of the
 is it as the Animus and so they're in
in chapter two texts are super 32 it's mentioned so I just sent Papa a giant you should have played on honey
 these are the Nia Moss the observances right or cleanliness
 contentment austerity study of scripture and Devotion to God and so this is from Edwin Brian says he puts his commentaries together by really especially piecing together, tears of classical commentators on the grocery list so that was what he writes is the next me and my RC I just took up the part that he wrote on top of the next Nema austerity or Tapas is the ability to tolerate hunger and thirst as well as all the duality of Life hot and cold excetera to avoid useless talk and to perform fast
Hari Haron under one of the important, there says that yoga requires one to tolerate the sufferings of the body endure hardships and remain undisturbed by the lack of physical Comfort he cautions however that inflicting hardship on the body in the form of volunteer voluntary austerity this is interesting in terms of reading right now I am parents should be undertaken only for the expiation expiation
 I can't say it just say it the expiation of sins or Lex bad, and not otherwise so he's why is he saying that he's saying you don't perform austerities to get powers okay okay you don't get it to develop Mystic Powers that's not a good Yogi doesn't write that status is now in the next verse it's as it does with me basically their teeth
how to get something very powerful say goodbye to say here is a knife okay you're to use this knife to you know yours uses tweezers in case you got a splinter don't start poking them around people's eyes okay that's not a good thing he's are explicitly for splinters not eye-poking of your little brother yeah or this gun is meant for protecting people come over around 4:10 like a robin them or robbing people were robbing people with it yeah okay so then a few that was 232 now moving 4243 wherein you know after he goes he goes to each one of those nehemiah's and with each one of them he he speaks about the special
 benediction one gets when they okay when they die
we apply that so he said so when you deeply play austerity what comes to you and so they says from austerity on account of the removal of impurities the Perfection of the senses and body manifest so that's City's rental professions you get these Perfections of that you can perform with the senses with the body. Let's read the commentary and I want you to know that stuff interest you are going to love it I know you would never resist use the Mystic cities if you're going to have them I would use them for good not evil that's why some day I may just let you know what if you got a little kid Feud everything in your life that you have now do you always use it for good time do you ever do things even out one day is just going to be bestowed upon me all the cities I'm going to go to your third eye open
all right so this is now I'm doing the commentary of of 243 well of 243 about these Mystic cities and still hit it so
 okay he even Brian rights as as early as The Vedic Brahma to texts
 Tapas has been recognized as a vital form of Preparatory a set of purification to be undertaken by the sponsor of The Vedic sacrifice the younger mana and has remained a fundamental ingredient of Indian soteriological traditions so he's saying you go back to the very oldest texts cuz patanjali text comes many not many centuries many centuries after Millennia after the 12:00 years old right back to the to the piranhas
thanks for the video of the baited brahmanist text so so he's saying even then it was recognized when you're doing yog know when you're doing ritual to get some material results the person that's performance should do austerities write the dead that it grants you something like that it that it that it gives our you know he continues as austerity practice says vyas so we asked comments comments on yoga sutras as mysterious practice says we are the impure covering of dirt us a shoot he named Lee Thomas and okay the lower modes they are destroyed and ask this happens the cities or mystical powers of the body such as Clairvoyance and do you know what this is clairaudience begin to see everywhere
 I think clairaudient sorry maybe I maybe hear ya could be David darshana
the gods appear you can see the gods right in front of you even though other people can't like I'm seeing so I know what I'm saying and I know also what you were saying I know you I know you knew that I know you knew that I knew you back but you still don't know I do know and I know you better than you know yourself what you just tell us what marriage is about to read definition definition of the power of Faculty of hearing something not present to the year but regarded as having objective Ria pick the dog so Clairvoyance and clairaudience to be able to see and hear everything okay so again I started so he just sang that through austerity Rogers and Thomas the lowermost maternal influence the desire that I need what I don't have or the or the the
let's say that the clouding and delusional energy of the lowermost it goes down and as that goes down then one begins to realize how nervous that we're kind of like Norman anyone could have if they did realize right okay so these mystical powers in the body such as Clairvoyance and clear on its manifest the commentators take potentially Perfection of the body Caillou Andrea city as a reference to the various mystical Powers cities that are the byproduct of yoga which will be discussed the next chapter hold your garage and ramen on the star Squad together other commentators still more commentators is the zoom but we don't know
take the time to listen Purity should refer to the kleshas not to the lowermost but to the kleshas the kleshas namely our ignorance of the estimate that you go frog attachments to a shuffle version and Abby Nevaeh the cleaning to life and they can see your Hari Haron unda understands them to be subject to the limitations of the body such as hunger thirst and other Cravings so either you're either through austerity or either becoming free from the lower modes you're becoming free from those places you're becoming free from Hunger thirst and other Cravings your purifying because you know austerity means you no longer listen to the mind you're like you're saying mind you been running the show and I've been following all along now I'm running so I'm going to do the exact things that you don't want me to do I'm in control now you're telling me don't stand on my toes I'm going to stand on my toes anyway and
and through their minds like don't do it stop and you like I don't listen to you anymore and they say these Mystic I mean we find it in our own life when we do austerities different things manifest so that that's the odds are that you've done or that's done yet it and what did what did you get from you start you start seeing with other senses that you didn't know you had
 welcome to my world. It is by the performance of austerity is in the form of sleep control done that to a distention from food retention of the vital energies of the body named Lee cell
done that excetera excetera. And by the practice of pranayama and Asana do that one can overcome these limitations by sheer willpower
 which he now approaches which as which is how he approaches all young as any of us and this least the men of station the city's Hari Haron on the notes this is interesting that Gianni's those who follow the path of Gana Yoga Yoga acknowledge generally do not develop these cities because they called me to see a shin and discrimination rather than austerity
 is the yogis that actually practice you know it's certainly the the life of the Gandy for us would be seen as a very austere life yeah but it's the apostrophe
 that that develops these is more than Yogi less to get ready
cities then are specifically the byproduct of Tapas in this view Gianni's are unlikely to be interested in such a tame and anyway continuous hard-hearted Nunda and neither are the yogis who use them if at all only to further their spiritual goals so now what we have is we have a we have a person in the form of her in your class you poop who is he's a powerful man and he's a very determined man and he's a very angry man
 and his is in creep man and he's decided that he'll get the power that he wants so they can get the Revenge that he wants through practice to Yoga practices the bus steriti and he's so determined that he's going to pull it off and it could become dangerous sure
