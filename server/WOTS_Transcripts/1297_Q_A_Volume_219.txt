 today's of you and I are going to be in Boston both days I'm going to be at Back Bay yoga union today and then I'll show it to you in a book signing and Q&A at Bridge 9 records in Beverly Massachusetts to do that would have been that Newbury Comics isn't that they didn't have my book. You don't they have them lots of graphic
lots of comic books
 I want to do graphic novel going to take that I don't know what I was looking about graphic novels I think there's not that many words and graphic novels it's mainly Graphics the graphics like little that's why that's why I wanted to write a novel but I see you're on the graphic. It's so hard to convey him to write it over a cup of coffee there so little no but that doesn't mean
 well I'm saying is there's not that many words even per page is not that every frame has to be carefully considered
 yes but I'm saying it's easier to write cuz how many words that's a lot of easy easy that's my point because there's not a lot of words doesn't mean that it's easy
 whatever
 unless I read up on it I did quite a bit of study on it did you or graphic novels
set that important it's like a it's like a whole genre I got a story and I got a great artist so but it's only certain types of people read graphic novels like certain type of a lot of people kids a lot of people getting a graphic novel seven days it's not just it's not just like something for kids it's like it's amateur art form now you know SEC it is but it's a type of person that reads them I'm saying
 well maybe people get into an African student writes it yes that is an audience out there and there's a large audience a reason for sure we were looking at Trident books and Newbury Comics for styles of wisdom of the ages cook books at Marist work all good idea and yeah so excited about the Christmas into place called Newbury Comics in came up with this discovery has a lot of graph
I was never, kid I wasn't either
 I don't know anybody that was truthfully oh by the way your mic I think needs to be turned up a little bit at the last couple days I've been quiet just a little bit
 not you
 alright I already starting to question you and I was your morning announcements to make sure we got it all people signed up for Indian looking forward to that India with me and Cass tuba and Mara in October check out my website with Ragu Ragu enough. Yoga
 and they call right afterwards that's feeling up to going to Trek through the mountains of Nepal siding
 artless to start right this is from our Discord the red we have sort of weird guess what we're consolidating all are dead
ways to reach people who have WhatsApp groups of Discord thread we have email telegram we have so many whenever we have to cancel the show holiday we got married on so many platforms we are consolidating when this new platform comes around we're excited for it again we're getting closer when we have some really beautiful say B working on it want to thank them for that
 but this is from a Discord thread and its from Michael on or 1975 this is great because right to nectar devotion on page 75 in the nectar devotion what is an act of devotion we better talk to Ocean is a work of roopika Swami he's one of the Disciples of Lord say Tanya who was sent to burn Dobbin to discover holy places and to really start to compile the boxy shastri's which is taking the essence out of all the way to teachings of bhakti and compile them into literature and
in the end the nectar of devotion is sort of like a Express train of how to develop Krishna bhakti actually his book The Box you rest and reaches into is and the nectar of devotion is probably should have going through all those texts and weaving in purports to make it a readable yeah
 it has really important things on Krishna bhakti historically very important. The rest and reaches into the very important text him so probably early in early in his leg when he came to America started producing all these books and he put that one out early because he knew was such an important text right cuz you don't know how long he's going to live you make sure that we had his version of the Buckley rest of it to send it which is called an extra portion okay so says I'm paid seventy-five of this book in a section called dancing before the deity if you quotes are provided about the benefits of dancing before
here's one example of a person who is in a jubilant Spirit who feels profound emotional ecstasy while dancing before Krishna
 and who manifest different features bottle the expression I was I was I was I was making different features to their and they're like this no I said what it means there is your hair's different features a bottle expression hair standing on end tears coming from the eyes voice choking up by soon as you could be big faces Adventures of bodily expression can burn away all the accumulated simple reactions he stopped up for many many many thousands of years
 is it talk about the chairs today on the show where we was were talking about prologue was talking about this it's like it is an Express train to love of God and is it it's this special
the gift we have until you gotta like a catapult to love of God and you might not even get it you might get like sucked into a tiny to go visit at a Sunday feast and everyone's dancing and someone grabs you by the rest and next thing you know you're dancing
 but if you think about the lifetimes a Bad Karma we have
 crazy things that we've done it starts to get burn away your karma starts to change and now that the the question the question or says I've been attending kirtan of my local iskcon Center where we spend time dancing in front of the deities but I'm wondering if deity includes pictures or statues of Krishna one owns that haven't been blessed or went through what special blessing or procedure image on images on more official altars
 I've had it done to them I guess the idea is okay you have a regular installed deity at at
do you get that benefit dancing to a picture of Krishna
 yeah more official authors he's kind of a doesn't really have the right word more... Official Alters the question is is he saying in this in this ancient texts somebody saying if if in the temple you're dancing for the DD all these wonderful effects are there does that also apply if you're not liking it at a temple where the DD hasn't been installed through the official rituals that the temple is that a deed in a temple is established by do you still got that same benefit
 alright bro I'm already saying my answer this would be
 depending on your Consciousness depending on your Consciousness it's almost hard to measure these things and also
we're not out to shortages burner, we're out to find love of God so this is like if this is touching our heart and making us more attractive Christian that's all we should really be caring about man I guess it for the picture and I only burned a hundred births away bad, but I got to go to the official Duty so I can burn 1,000 versus bad, I don't think we look at it like that it's it's it's making these very loud statements to understand the importance of enthusiasm when C and Krishna form of a picture or a deity but in that Susie essman excitement to see Krishna we're cultivating a Consciousness and a mind and a heart that's connecting with Krishna as my Lord as my love and I think that's an important to take away from that statement not that like oh yeah man I got some I did some horrible things you know when I was a kid I got to go dance in front of the deities without looking it like a
try to get some Turkish market in a bargaining with the
 I agree with you I think Consciousness is the important thing here let's let's assume out a little bit and try to put all this in context right cuz like what is the nectar devotion what is the population of Jews in the world with what's being expressed herein why in early on in that text
 Rubidoux swap meet is it is it is it he has a style of writing it's not a style that uncommon within yoga text where the author makes a point and in the tradition you don't just make a point like like if you pick but if you go into a bookstore in the Barnes & Noble whatever right now and pick up a book on like self if you go to the self-help section there's all these authors of trying to tell you how you can make your life better not sure and they're just
this is what I realized about life and here you go in the yoga tradition in the body tradition that's not how they operate you don't just say this is what I think cuz I know they say this is what these ancient texts say this is this this is what these say Protect say Let me let me highlights some aspects of that for you and and put them in context for you so that they'll be relevant in your own life that's kind of what the that's a lot of help gurus will borrow things from ancient texts or ancient Traditions but they make it their own and claimed ownership to those things they do that or even if they don't know they're doing that really what this wisdom is kind of coming from there you can if it's real and authentic you can be able to find it there first you know exactly that's called that's called cultural appropriation when you're taking the credit for all those things that's not when you're eating it
or find a tradition of wisdom for people accused yoga of you and me of a few cultural programme which all kick cuz scuba today cuz he's a white male know okay
 but the idea is that yeah I know we're glorifying the tradition we're appreciated by taking the credit for it it's like an Indian tradition it's a it's a it's a tradition that goes beyond its Universal & Beyond this universe is like okay so here's the point so ago Swami wants to describe what is Buck tea how is a practice in speaking about sod in a bhakti right which he defines as its engage in the census in the service of Krishna that's how we practice this right
and and and Google why why do you want to engage the senses in the service of Krishna
 all of it he's going to say is to bring them on to Christmas somehow or other we need to get our awareness awareness has been captured it's been stolen by Christmas external energy after this goes to question number two and see when we get there is it the the external energy did the energy that tends to be a loser. That the energy that tends to take us away from truth understanding who we are understanding what are nature's understand what did need we need to be happy we tend to get caught up in that we're looking outside for these things now son the box is about bringing the mine somehow or other
 to the reality into the source of all reality to the root of all reality to Krishna right so in order to establish a point Ruby Cassandra doesn't just say it then he's going to say it's not me that's saying it we can go to the sacred texts that so then
post you involved with him and he's any quotes this is nard and Mooney great Authority right now. I'm only mentions this sudden about the instrument by which time seven Canto first chapter verse 32 he says they're taking you to steer my dear King one has to fix his mind on Krishna by any means find a way to do it get them on there and then proper rice this is called Krishna Consciousness it is the duty of the attached Aria the spiritual Master to find ways and means for his disciple to fix his mind on Krishna that is the beginning of something about the you know where you and I have been talking about this right this is real important you see what's going to follow in the in the nectar devotion in the bunch of rest of me to send you a few chapters down
 is it going to be 64 different
 ways to practice Sunday bhakti 64
is it going to listen that is there so the group or the acharya
 can help the disciple saying okay somehow or another we got to get your mind focused on Krishna here 64 ways we could do that it really works I'll tell you how how how the proof that run
 Crock-Pot when he's established all these different temples he established a program that the that the people living in the temple and the practitioners of bhakti living in the temple would follow it was a morning program it was an evening program but if you look at the morning program practically every one of these 64 items of devotion service is squeezed into it as it wasn't just a random thing okay now we're going to worship Tulsi now we're going to have a random let's go site
sing holy places it is the senses are all engaged in the senses are engaged in the higher just like if you eat something very sweet but if you need something less sweet you can even taste the less sweet thing the same way in in bhakti when your senses go to very high versions of sense
 enjoyment through box because we were cutting our senses off it's just like the sensors are connected to love of God creates a different impression in the mind like we are asked to dance wear order to dance Mickey on the charger Road in The Message Board we are asked to dance out of Duty in the beginning yes I got the feeling because sometimes you like what what do I do here and we danced our heart and with your mind and with the song that goes with it
you're hearing songs and you're seeing the the form of the Lord and your smelling the incense burning in the smell of the Tulsa Burning and your hands touching the the lamp and the scent of the lamp in the ceiling of the lamp is a complete sensual activity yes since Those sensors and now you could be just walking somewhere and you could smell some incense has happened the other day I smelled some incense and I brought me back to that place it brought me right back to being an attempt will be in a wholly owned those feelings you know that feeling now yeah where the smell of prashad I went to the Brooklyn Temple Reese I walked and tell me when I said it smells exactly the way it smelled 40 years ago and we're creating these anchors to bring us to places anchors when times are tough
 because it's not like we're living in the temple our whole life
you and I live in subwoofer if you know even though we lived there for a while I was only a few years in the greater portion of our life so when times get tough in the material world we have these anchors to go back on the feeling of what how free it is to dance in front of the deities the freedom of sitting with friends and sharing for shot or serving for shot to someone else someone handing you tell see in the smelling of the Chelsea dancing in kirtan sort of aloof to public opinion this is great we're going to what you're describing is the purpose of this Temple
 is to give us the opportunity to engage The Senses Into Social Service to practice on the body right in it and I like it where you went with it cuz Prophet what profit when he
chapter about the rest of me to send you or not your devotion
 deciding about these defined you know I was engaged in the census in it in the service of Krishna and proper rights there he says
 he said he wants to make it clear that what we're doing through that practice is run covering something that's already within us my source is prac proper rites as practice means employing both of mind and senses impractical devotional service the 64 items right through this practice is not for developing something artificial for example a child learns you know what I'm going to say there's a great analogy I use just now at you all the time child learns how to walk exactly right when the parents are like you're holding my pinkies walking in the child with the word is inherently is built in the child it's not like the yeah you know something fake box
inherit in the soul that's right if you ask the kid to do some bizarre dance or something like that that might be like artificial but the walking it's right there in the kitchen at the teacher separately but walking is that's normal so he says for example of child learns our practices to walk this walking is not unnatural the walking capacity is there originally in the child and simply by a little practice he walks very nicely zimmerly devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the natural instinct of every living entity even on civilized men
 like the Aborigines offer their respective obeisances to something wonderful exhibited in Nature's law and they appreciate that behind some wonderful exhibition or action there's something Supreme so this Consciousness no lying dormant in those who are materially contaminated that's us once I need to do this practice right is found in every living entity and one purify this is called Chris
so the idea set up Guru at a Cheerio a teacher could take this text understanding okay I get it we need to engage our senses in order to bring our mind to grivna and when we bring the mind to Krishna than this dormant capacity to love Krishna or Baba it arises rice or something about the leads to Bob about the attention you know and also need to pray so so okay so that's there so then later on you go through chapters down the book is going to list ease 64 items and one of the 64 items is the one that Michael has drawn our attention to today which is has to do with dancing before the D I have to insert something to do with the first point you made to worship is there and if you don't worship the person I've got head that's okay notice a child will put something some Hozier have some superhero some sportstar
I was just with you know the editors of mandalas and part of their side business is this thing called Sideshow and Sideshow they create deities are forms of Star Wars figures or you know they're expensive you can buy Darth Vader or by the noble do all these characters from movies or horror movies or things like that Luke Skywalker he's like people buy them all of the world they buy them and they're sort of like deities in their home and they sort of like respect the archetype of that being like this way meditate on it was why there is a. There's a desire inherent to worship something stronger more powerful than yourself and acted on it
you're a Lord Shiva you're going to do it as some other thing of this world
 what do they call them now that dogs on the plains therapy dogs there was not a therapy dog now that's their deity their therapy but you can talk to your deity like your therapy dog to get the how are you Christian today how are you think about it that's how you get close to your duty to talk to Matt that are you okay here's what I'm doing today if you'll do that with your dogs okay
 so so thank you for that right now so going on now dancing party dancing before the DD in the temple this is an instruction that a guru could give to disciple to help him practice on the body for the purpose of bringing their mind a Krishna in order to awaken Baba lovely Krishna within them okay that's that's the sign sets the idea of how it works and he gave this interesting quote so in order to establish that point again
regular slime he's not going to say this is my idea he's going to go to the Piranhas he's going to go to the different texts on this that will ensure quote there to establish his points one of the points he shared here in the question a person who is in juven spirit dances before the DD all this Karma's being burned away right now and it and then and he gives a second one out I read that one too cuz it's a great one
 he says in the same book there's a statement by Narda oh this is from the dark mahatmya he's quoting the door come work at my happiest hours for caitian of dwarka aces in the same book there's a statement by Nardo where in East States
 from the body of any person who claps and dances before the DD
 showing manifestations of ecstasy
Baba all the birds of sinful activities Fly Away off work then prop properly whites just as by clapping the hands
 what can cause many birds to fly away my people do that many birds fly was similarly the birds of all of our Bad Karma which are sitting in the body let you know they're like seeds there because you're ready to fly away simply by clapping before the DD of Krishna so 22
 two arguments against the two presentations were made there to to substantiate what river goes Tommy was saying that this dancing before the DD is very powerful method of yoga right and it's it's it is going to relieve you of of your sister this an important Point Road tell me tell me it is that the way that the proxy about the dog is doing
it's not
 this idea becoming free from our Bad Karma or in more religious language you say it is becoming free from your sin rekeson we say send sync mean
 the action that you do that's sinful their butts in also means the reaction that you have two coming from it you know like what comes in people that think on the religious level or in the Nevada Core Yoga paired on Wednesday on the karmic level
 their mind is concerned with I want to join be happy in this world and if my bad, if my previous bad actions are going to bring suffering to me I need to think about how I'm going to deal with that and so just as the Christian might think my sin is going to cause me to have to go to hell I need to do something about this counteracting of sin
 is a lower-level kind of spiritual thought
you're bargaining your bargaining with God yeah you just like saying it's a cell it's a type of self set selfishness you know you just concerned about my own experience you're not responding with love your kind of like help me out of myself frame here they are I'll do this many prayers this many months is this Penny rosaries to let me offer that time I stole from stole from work okay and they do that they do that in with in Hinduism and it's all it's all over Buddhism is everywhere everywhere you're trying to counteract some bad, you know is coming that's why I'm so so when when someone picks up one of the charger when I grew in in the in the practice of Bucky Olga is picking up the body rest and reaches into the natural lotion and prescribing right quick prescribing these 64 activities or some of the 64 activities for the disciple
 they're not.
it with that motive when it so it's going to say and like all the bad karma is fine with is not the idea that now you can enjoy the world because your bad karma is gone you know what I like the way you're presenting this we said the same thing we're coming from the same and I'm telling you right that's right that's the reason why the people to become free of their bad, is because it's going to lighten their load in their effort to bring their mind to Krishna and I'll be at 11 I'll go to go to bed so much better put it when I'm when am I'm just happy it's hard to find love of God because you got so many other things pulling us around yeah it's so we're going to counter that in every way we can we're going to and that's now let's talk about the temple right to cuss at what is the temple was the purpose of a lot of times because people because there's people that aren't so deep in terms of the spiritual continent has people that come a little deeper and when they get
little deeper they start to see all the hypocrisy
 that goes on in the religious institution and then they begin to say what's the point of this Temple right right it's really about what's going on inside out about what's going on outside and you know it's late and there's some truth in the half of it there's truth in that sometimes the temples can drive you crazy you organization sort of like the fundraising it was not me crazy when they're doing the fundraising come on I can't wait just worship God I try to get some money to hold me by the ankles get the money out of my pocket okay but here's the point that I want to make a note but then you have to go further deeper as you go deeper going to see if there is a really good purpose if you understand it but maybe you never understood the real purpose of this Temple and you know I was thinking about this this morning. In terms of like let's say you had the aliens coming in
 I'm flying saucer I always think about this and they're flying around there here
flying around it like imagine you were an alien in a flying saucer I have so they shouldn't be too difficult and you are flying in and you're approaching a city like let's say you're flying into let's say she run them okay the design of India famous a handful like that you would be flying into the City and in your tension would where would your tension go first as you're flying it
 at first to the Dome ya took her to the band massive go pour a massive in the entire city a king decided
 we're going to build our most prominent architectural structure is going to be a temple that dedicated to bring in the mine to Vishnu so that people can do exactly what we're hearing about this book right going to that place engage your other senses bring your mind to this purifying source
so that will develop all the good qualities of kindness and generosity and compassion and and and become become more pure closer to God more loving towards God and we're loving towards everything maybe it's and it's a purpose of life we're going to we're going to engage our resources to make that right in the very center Center the whole city so if you were this alien coming in you say you would understand something about the values of these people and in it how Noble they are you know just by the architecture
 and establishment of this Temple is the central thing you go to Jaipur you go to wherever you go to these three has nothing but temples going to imagine you were flying into New York City you know I even just to make now there's like all these skyscrapers but let's say it was like 40 50 years ago do you like o Empire State Building Twin Towers Chrysler building citicorp building
so you'll be flying and you see that Empire State Building
 and you would understand okay this is where this civilization is like really focused let's see what his what is his teachers about their values like what are they focused on the interview the people like we see your structure tell us why you've built it in what's what this is about to your king did your leader build it will know that we don't really work that way
 this was just a people with the most money are able to build a building like this okay and their purpose is to 222 Foster you know higher values in the people is it now is really just a money-making thing you want to build it as tall as you can so you can put as many rooms in there is possible then you rent those out and you make a lot of money for your allergies are something about your civilization you know so the temple is the idea with
Campbell is you
 you and Gage all 12th you and Gage are architectural expertise artistic expertise all in placing God right in the middle like all the ornamentation and all the architectural structure the ornamentation the ritual is all designed specifically as a therapy you know that you go in there and now you're you know I I walk out of this building in my mind's going to distract it in so many different ways but when I walk in here it's all working favorably to bring my mind right to that root of all existence so that I can purify that mind developed these higher qualities relieve myself of of the bad thinking which is really the bad, right like the bad thinking
 the battle thinking Loops that I'm stuck in it and and become a Pure better
person connected to God connection ever-living I need the whole thing is designed to do that and that's why this text is saying if you clap your hands is saying about dancing right now if we were to if we were the aliens flying in and looking at the dancing that's going on in this culture with what we would see all here's Madonna dancing and thousands of people come to see this is Michael Jackson dancing thousands of doubt you know the feeling of stadiums of people people watching it on television new Shakira dancing or whoever did Dancing executor of 10 dance and so on
 why why is she dancing why is he dancing they're glorifying themselves and essentially their kind of showing look how great I am and you are great yeah and there's excites me sure where it was the ideas the whole reason the temple is built is because we all have that propensity to Dan
but when you put it in the temple in front of the DD than you feel natural your tension goes two DD and no longer your dancing to glorify yourself no longer are you dancing to you don't attract attention to become the center yourself know you're dancing for the pleasure of the center of the root of all this distance is very interesting isn't it dancing for Krishna your beauty you're not dressing up putting on a costume for your beauty you're doing it to glorify God very interesting and hit a different ship is the exact same thing but things are slightly slightly shifted so much benefit and you build up your devotion instead of building up your ego there you go exactly so that's why I told Cheryl Arts everything we do as an offering to God instead of an offering to our ego when I do it at the offering of for our ego our life
more complicated impacted painful stressful competitive would you to serve God become free the others not become untied give me some joyous you beautifully said or beautifully said so so so now let's go back to the nectar devotion is about to rest and reaches into what is Rupa goswami doing here he sang do you recharge a deer Guru when you're instructing your disciple how to practice sudden a bhakti here 64 ways you can do it one of them is to dance in front of the D&D Dragon Temple and why because when your disciple goes into that Temple naturally his unicycle already has the desire to dance it's in there you don't have to tell never dance
 you even tell him dance but dance in the temple for the deed do it a little bit every day and then when they dance their all of the architecture all
the ritual all of the everything is kind of naturally bring you like I'm dancing for Krishna and you know what I was thinking when I was thinking about this two ways to Leave Your Lover I was looking for ways to please Lord Krishna dance and I had him through a little project that situated and so so so yeah it's telling the guru you can instruct her to Salt so what I was thinking
 was I like to dance before the day we were wrong when we went to my poor this year you were sick one day and and and little Corona let it cure town in the temple yeah I miss that day and I was dancing before the DVD with Tara And and it was just so satisfying of course that leaves an impression in the conscious
for you and for everybody witnessing sometimes people are dancing but they're witnessing you know what I've had people come to me so you know what I saw the devotees dance and something happened something joyful happened within my heart that's enough to leave the impression and that's why is again it's from the orders of the spiritual Master dance almost out of Duty and then it becomes Braden normal that you want to dance and it has a benefit for everybody involved even or a skeptic looker yeah yeah it says a lot I could build faith it creates Faith witnessing someone else's devotion sure creates face and it being enthusiastic and it's not it's not fake it's real because cuz your spiritual person we can be enthusiastic for the New York Giants or the New Jersey Giants winning
it is anymore Jersey okay you can be a steep for them and he could dress up like them or paint your body of the colors of the cushion and being enthusiastic it doesn't give you anything except paint on your body and you might be like really a student on their staying on the nuances of how good the Giants are in there but it doesn't get this type of enthusiasm for Krishna releases one from all bonds of the material world where as you know and hate the guy from the Jets I hate the guy from the Oilers or hate the guy from
 yeah you know is it all of this is laid out and about your rest and reaches into his describing that there's there's six Hallmarks of pure devotional service like six ways that a manifest and beautiful powerful ways and said nobody threw something about you get two of them and then when they mature
send to Bob about to get four of them are going to tours in the frame about you get off all six of them is kind of the qualification for tried it when one feels an eagerness when one and it actually you know that's a rubeola Swami say to send that when this Sunday but his executor with a genuine longing
 then it has the potential to bring forward Bob about you know some Louis Prima bhakti and so the temple is designed to keep us focused on that in to help develop that General long and we get that through we go to the temple we hear the stories about Krishna right we associate with the devotees of Krishna will see the Dida picture that is to help us get to the genuine longing how you doing your devotion infusiasm by one associated with enthusiastic people right that's why I like you you're enthusiastic or bhakti
associate with people are enthusiastic and other way to become enthusiastic is Mara
 just be enthusiastic that is something you can actually turn on some kind of the DD dancing part of the time there's nothing worse than you trying to leave there's some guy just like look it up if you want it experienced it you get least got to go through the motions at first clap your hands and guess what just by doing it on the orders of Guru I'm just going to clap and sing someone next to you may be having the worst day of their life and eventually you might start smiling because you're clapping and that might affect them has taken their life if you have taken their life but you you're clapping
 dancing what is this a run this was so I enjoyed dancing that we've danced in I remember we dance nicely in the shoebox I'm going over here that's who I am
that your plants are beautiful dancing sometimes it's not always sometimes you say this I think the women danced more nicely than the men well depends what man I just need some bad women in general I'm saying in general and you know why I am my own opinion cuz the men don't know what a dance they're not trained had a dance is because the women danced together in harmony you know like the men just do the cross the wrists when each other around and like take out for today in a big huddle and just like and they say I think that's a style you want to call that a style it's less conducive for for green reminder Krishna whereas this and when we read about SRI chaitanya and the dancing life princess we read about the dancing that took place in front of the DD for a jog
on the road at the ratha yatra festivals in the air we hear that there is lead singers for that your times and they're also
 leaderboard at the dancers which indicates to me I would assume that it means that they were dancing and harm either dancing and together you know so I think about Mara Just Dance so much she's not like maybe it's because she's not around that kind of dancing enough you know where like people are dancing together I think we really got it this young people is just up their thing to do and so much and she's a very introverted and then there's a service and not dance well there 64 items there so it doesn't have to be all of them you got 63 more is knitting one of them eliminate that one Krishna want to be a clap your hands at least a week and but but any case
I think that's a really beautiful thing when people dance nice and there's one more point I want to make it to the room we only got five minutes I would just did this one question we should wrap up this question but let's wrap up this question is it the same if you're not in the temple the whole point of the temples to bring him out of Krishna so if you're anywhere in your mind is dinner your dancing for Christmas pleasure it's the same thing the temples that help you think that way and feel that way and if you're thinking that way and feeling that way then you're then the deed is everywhere the deed is in your heart the DD is with you all the time again that's the point of going to the temple is the neophyte devotee only sees God in the temple
 write the advanced devotees seen that TV everywhere in the heart of them self in the heart of every living being you know where ever they look they see it and so they they feeling the presence of God everywhere when they're dancing in their clapping their hands it's just as good as doing it
Temple because the purpose of Temple has been a cheat if they're doing it for the pleasure of Krishna and in an absorption quick thought absorbing Christian that's your body
 but I want to say this Runner what would you want to say and this is something that you and I have been talking about recently to is that when you and I got into bhakti the thing was you moved into a temple so first thing before you go to Temple is a little strata there's a little thing you're not just saying I need a place to stay tonight like hopefully now and then and then the next Sunday begin to like to associate with these devotees that faith is increasing and when you get to the party like I want to practice that's called budgen decree that we would move into a temple at that point and all these 64 items we would engage in them they they were prescribed for a sploot also get a guru at that time and they would personally prescribed different different practices of vodka for us and we will see that the devotees
spiritual eyes would accelerate at that point O take off boys now people don't live in the temples while the devotees the other you know all the people that are coming now they rarely move into the temple and we need to see that they get the instructions
 in these practices effectively otherwise it kind of stagnates at that point you know that every everyone is practicing but he needs to have a clear idea here's the practices and I'm focusing on for this purpose you know here's how much I'm going to do it when I'm going to do it that's that's how the group work said that those are the kind of instructions that they gave me so that one of them things I should I think they should have invite people over their house and they should sing together and make prashad that's one of the and read the data together more specific instructions to and I think we need to appease somehow that they get those that I'm just saying this is for people who aren't living necessarily in the temple they understand
programs what a lot of people aren't going to have a home program they're going to need some more personalized instruction
 are you always putting them all into that box or are you putting them into that box of they need more personal instruction that's a bigger box
 your box is within that box is yours within mine nationalist need to be talked about I appreciate the question and I appreciate what you've shared rather okay good thank you then you just in a book that do the yoga Workshop sir I got used today in the do in the old days yoga Workshop had a big group of yogis up there and Boston is where I met Catherine
