 hi Emily are you here is a trick Emily is it one of these were very professional here was with sages as you can tell with our computer setup on yoga blocks but this microphone you have to put your mouth like right on it for to pick up okay that you just did it wrong okay what's your story how are you how did you get here in this yoga thing where you from tell us a little bit about your journey
 hi moved around a bunch and had material things in my life that were not serving me and
felt a little lost in this world through walking into Veda I had already have the seed of yoga and Seed of yoga in me but they do really
 water the sea thank you thank you very really water exactly exactly
 so super blessed for that experience and super blessed inokuma and be with this yoga training group I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be right now and I'm very very thankful for that most beautiful guess it all cuz I'm coming
 all right and eight year living in California okay great so where it what is your question about the Bhagavad Gita and it mentions a lot in a Krishna Hare Krishna and I was talking
another friend the other day we were talking about Vishnu and I just wasn't sure how Vishnu correlated in with Krishna question, this Emily should I leave stay here should Emily go back how it how would you be more comfortable
 okay what about am I talking to you I'm going to be looking this way all right
 so I know that's a really good question and
 we can go back to some of the things we talked about last night like Krishna being the god of love this it this is what we have to do know we have been fed different ideas about God as we were growing up
 the idea of Christian we may not have been fed that one but it's a very special unique one and when they call Krishna the god of love like people do that casually again I don't know if that's done anywhere like in this shastra in this ancient scriptures anything like that what people say that but in one sets
it does make sense that Krishna the only thing that interests him
 is engaging in The Adventures of love that's what he does and he doesn't do anything else that's like so he's doing that in the spiritual realm he's doing that end in the the highest Pinnacle place with the most intimate Adventures of spiritual ever going on in there he's you see him as Krishna with two arms and some people love him with my parental love and so to them he appears as though a little sweet Little Krishna and some people seem like they loved him like a friend and that he look like his friends the Cowboys they're running around with him and the gopis or love him with like the romantic love
 and that's the kind of love it that excites him and interest him in an even it said even controls
 like
she's like this is the kind of day that the sages meditate on their singing he's the most powerful the very source of power and yet this kind of love this intimate kind of love overpowers him
 how can I be an Indian of Love requires that one become kind of vulnerable and in love want one wants to feel overpowered and so that's how he relished that's what he relishes in life and only that
 but some misguided Souls like ourselves are playing around in this virtual reality of this world the material world and it needs to be managed there's a whole system of that needs to be in place there's got to be Karma the law of karma is someone's got to run that whole show and there's got to be at the cycles of creation and destruction this is like the workings of time if you can consider like the law of Karma and time to be like
if this world is a virtual reality these are programs that have been downloaded and installed into the virtual reality cuz otherwise we could get quite comfortable here but we're actually meant to get messages that are telling us this is not our home this is a virtual reality and end time really helps with that because whatever we get like where we desire something and then we finally got it then we lose it and that's the fourth time downloaded you know into this world and the law of karma is there is kind of like a cosmic sensitivity training that's meant to help us more cording to our true nature which is compassionate and kind and thoughtful and sensitive and so on so the law of karma is meant to train one reward Behavior that's harmonious with our true nature and give us a bit of a pinch when we're going the other way
 is Lord Vishnu that manages the whole material world
is in other words it's like say you wanted you had your own life you know Pleasant life at home but there was other business that needed to get done and rather than have to go into yourself you could just expand and another Emily could come out of you with four arms and that Emily would go and take care of business and you would remain doing what you want to do so it's you're there
 and your awareness is there but meanwhile you just stay absorbed in what you want to do sometimes that analogy is given to the Krishna
 is like well you can say this way that Vishnu is like a judge right like if you go into the courtroom how do you relate to the judge with respect right everybody in that courtroom what do they call the call the judge everybody calls him your honor right and Krishna is like that same judge same person
but when he's at home is in a different mood and it's a different it's a different atmosphere like his wife doesn't call him your honor what did she call him baby baby hey baby and that would be completely appropriate inappropriate if you're fighting a traffic ticket in to listen baby because that person has a different relationship with the judge of his wife his went when he comes in the doors with hey baby welcome home but when she goes into the courtroom she doesn't call him baby in the courtroom right she calls him your honor yeah she doesn't call him by his first name is it's it's so Vishnu is like
 the god that is taken care of business and that you were late to with reverence
 and Krishna is like that same person but at home were you really into like when when the judge comes home the little kids come running up and they said
Play We want to play get down and in the knees down on all fours and are climbing on top of him and he's like being like a little horse and he's telling the little kids are saying go there go there go there cuz I just no respect
 but heed this is what he relishes more right this is so that's Krishna Krishna is the Supreme
 that you can love with intimacy vishnal is his is him in another mood taking care of other types of business and that we can go more and more into Vishnu and how he manifests in different levels and stuff it's really fascinating stuff but I think that hopefully gets you started maybe Rogan us could add something that was a pretty thorough definition but I just want to say
 in our reaching out to God or our reaching out to our higher power we might have this feeling where I want God as the all-powerful the all-knowing the one the protector and for that a manifest in Lord Vishnu
landlord ROM
 but some people want a more intimate relationship. As my lover this is like really in this Krishna bhakti it's bhakti but very very intimate Christian my lover Chris is my friend and it's not like one of them is wrong, right it's the heart develop so proclivity proclivity towards a type of worship down the road on our spiritual journey in according to who your teachers are that are putting that type of bhakti in your heart and so it's not like it's wrong when when when when the judge comes and steps in the courthouse and then all rise that's very normal and there is people who want to see the judge like that or the general like that they had they want that respect is not inappropriate and in the same thing you made a good analogy the judge comes home in a little children want to plan his back and becomes a horse it would be completely inappropriate to close to the came up to me and said will you be at work so I can play on your back
not completely inappropriate just because we have a different relationship so after a while on a spiritual journey we start to cultivate a certain relationship with our source and it can manifest in in one of reverence in one of them complete intimacy and sell in within what we know as of this date
 understanding of truth it's going to go into every detail because it's the it's the absolute truth could you so much information I mean we could just say is you just love God okay that's cool but if you want to go deeper into that there's answers there there's not a holy book in India there is Cannon's encyclopedias of holy books and it goes into great detail there's a wasted like tell time right right and then there's also ways to tell time but also understand how a watch work
how to take the whole thing apart The Vedic teachings are like that it's like an unabridged understanding of spiritual truth so yeah it's you're going to have to ask you a question it's not going to be easy just go out there and look. You're not even to say thank you for those really
 it's a fact we could go on and on and on like all day on this topic and it's something that
 Rugrats and I did both and practicing this for about 37 years
 and two things one thing is you're always learning new things which are fascinating and the other thing is the things that you've heard many many many times you begin to understand them more deeply than ever before that and that's maybe even more exciting
 but when we talked about Vishnu
 you know if we if we picture Krishna in the spiritual realm and the place they call a
Loca that's where that intimate love is being shared and then there's many levels in the spiritual world where he is related to a different ways including as Vishnu they call him there no Diana the same for armed but in the mature want within that unlimited spiritual Sky they say there's like a bubble in a sense and that's the material world
 and this is the far-out stuff that requires some face
 there's like water in that bubble and Lord Vishnu is lying in that water
 and from his breath as he breathes that unlimited universes are coming out of his body like in the rubble You couldn't possibly count them
 and one breath is the Universe goes out
 and on the inhaler comes back in
 so his time scale is a very you know it not only is the size of his body but this time scale is just I can conceive
long
 and so he's he's breathing out unlimited universes and then he enters again as the next level of Vishnu he enters into each one of those universes and that's half full of water is long at a that in from his body grows a lotus
 and on that Lotus is born Northborough Ma
 and you heard it from our foreheads and he becomes the creator of the universe and the scented like the and he takes all the ingredients and he designs all the species of life and all the planets and in all of this on behalf of issue
 and then he creates all the different bodies of all the different species and then he said the third level of vision of a Into the Heart of every living being
 right so that there's not one of us that doesn't have him in our heart and if we look just like a body has a soul inside and his soul that spreads his Consciousness throughout the in
my body so the body is dead without the soul the soul makes it come alive they say that universe is like the body of this second Vishnu right that he's in each Universe there's a soul of the universe that spreads its Consciousness throughout the entire universe that's Lord Vishnu the second Lord Vishnu
 and so there's a lord of the entire universe and then every one of us has the lord of the universe inside us right next to us and the heart so it's a it's this is what you always meditate on it when the August would do a stronger yoga when they would do this very deep yoga words it's all about going into the State of samadhi the State of Trance mostly they were doing it to try to find this Vision with in the heart
 but it's something if it's something that the bug of agita says that when you become aware of Vishnu in the Heart Like That
 that your mine never becomes degraded
like if you're standing next to someone that you deeply respect and you have reverence for the kind of your behavior kind of goes up saying that when you feel that Vishnu in your own heart you're like that all day what's speak of when you recognize that Vishnu in the heart of every other living being the respect that you show to all life you know this this is what the the real stages are like the deeply spiritual people this idea Vishnu in the heart of me Vishnu the heart of everyone else they're really attuned to that and it's making them it's it's inspiring them to behave on the level of what we would call like a asadu or Saint it sits in yoga we should be searching for this we should be trying to feel this way should be meditating on this end we should be opening up that conversation
 you're here inside me please reveal yourself to me please allow me to feel your presence at all time you know so devoted Krishna also is feeling that in their heart to you no meditating on God in the heart all the time and it's it's really a fundamental part of taking you
to the deeper place where we really become different people or you could say we're really become ourselves you know that the real stuff underneath
 Keystone what's that was a very detailed but I very very much appreciated that extra we appreciated your question
 I was going to I was just saying sometimes when you start explaining how you did I was like it's like this sounds too crazy too much to see you. I always put the real Skeptics brain in cuz I'm a New Yorker and I don't believe anything and so but if you understand just in this room right now you can say well we're in Los Angeles
 okay well what is Los Angeles looks like looks like this room. Mirrors on the wall is got brown walls just got these sound reflectors got hot yoga
you know heaters up in the corners got black shelves that's Los Angeles and it's true
 but we can't understand Los Angeles outside of this room when you're living in a room so what The Vedas do they give a key outside of your little tiny reference we are tiny little vantage point of reality
 it's not like the Hollywood sign is not a reality it's a reality it's not even that far from us but if all we know is this room then we can never understand it will just speak of the hills or the reservoir or the end of the whenever the LA Spanish for the beaches for the Santa Monica Mountains or the Venice canals will never do any of those things if we just live in this room with this machine that we have this human body we have very limited scope of reality of a tiny subjective view of reality we don't have objective reality
please so when the windshield pro-pot first brought the teachings of Krishna bhakti
 to America you started New York City
 and then he flew out this was the song This was 67 and he flew out to San Francisco and he started Center there and these are just store fronts
 but the first real Temple like a real building was actually on La Cienega Boulevard correct that's where we are now
 okay is on La Cienega Boulevard and that was like a sacred fire stone building
 what did they put something out there now or okay is same building or we got to go down to the radial tire Averett tires
 officer there's a man bowing down to the snow tire rack
here
 okay so that that building was the first Hari Krishna Temple in the western world
 and it was kind of the first one that wasn't a storefront so kind of like they had management and if there was a president of the temple and vice president and a Treasurer and ensure a proper was kind of just establishing how things would work out of that Temple
 Bach from here whatever and my Guru was there and he was the treasurer I think at that time he was brand new to all of this but he was like really sharp in together person he was destined to become an important leader
 and one day he went to show the proposed room
 and he started saying I think he had a very powerful some might say pushy kind of like a wave and so I think sometimes people going back to Prague
and he went in he said you know I'm trying to do this but this person is not cooperating I'm trying to do that but this person is so hard to deal with and this one's complaining about that and then he's like just going down his list of complaints and she'll probably said this he said he just actually it was a painting that was the original painting of the first of the cover the first can't hang it on the wall and universes and all the little planets and then it shows the different other planets were nerina lives in the spiritual realm and then it shows that Bubble Witch is the material around
 and then it shows Lord Vishnu breathing out all the universes and then it shows inside the universe he's lying down in the lotuses and it shows all of that and so he's showing that painting to my Google who's his name is Tamil Krishna goswami
he didn't begin to describe all of that how this material world we can't measure it it's in the spiritual Skies infinite and within that there's a there's a bubble of the material realm and there's no measuring that there so it's beyond any number that we have to measure any of unit that we have to measure it and Lord Vishnu his body is breathing unlimited universe is we can't measure one Universe he's breathing out unlimited universes
 and in those universes are unlimited planets and you saying that there's you sent his life on all of them
 this is The Vedic we may not be able to see it but the address is there life is everywhere
 any saying and in amongst those unlimited planets in this one Universe it's it said like each universe is just like a a mustard seed inside a huge bag you know it's like and he said it is inside the universe this one universe that we're in there
unlimited planets we don't know how many planets there are
 and he said one of those planets is called Earth
 and you sitting on that first there so many countries with so many cities and they're sitting on that or if there's one place called the United States and end in the United States as a city called Los Angeles and in Los Angeles there's millions of people in millions of buildings and Sonic and and on one building on La Cienega Boulevard there's 12 Mall Krishna
 and he is thinking he is very important
 that we consider the circumstances in our life to be overwhelming one person says one thing that we interpret correctly or incorrectly as like insulting to us are disrespectful and our mind will go
Lutz on this forever will get so Disturbed this is so insignificant what's going on in this world in one sense it's all very tiny and insignificant in the scale of time it's a blip in the scale space if it looks back and the yogi has to kind of embrace that this we have two eyes one eye is kind of in the here-and-now and one eye is that June. Perspective when we have the two together we can we will get the messages will see the true that we need to see and so with that feeling Vishnu when you're hard all the time you're like the massive unlimited lord of the universe is right here inside me all the time and feeling that presence has
 maybe you know one of the most transformational aspects of of our own progress in but the old approach because everyone often times has that one I have material like I'm a parent where my kids are my kids okay right
you can't just open the other are the spiritual I say okay kids you're on your own now we're not even of this world it's all your life is insignificant
 10 years we can't be like that we have to have both eyes open our spiritual eye and their material I they work together so nicely
 they call these posters stereo stereograms stereograms
 have one eye you'll never see the image of a rise out of it I didn't know that was a to I thing or the stereogram to requires two but when you look at it with both eyes then the image arises the message I just supposed to get comes out and so silly for us it's we have both his eyes right but going to get this asking Arjuna to be active in the world now take up responsibility right b a b a warrior and do do what do your duty
and the same time Christian telling the zoom out and understand you know that this is just one planet in universe that's in that's a world of suffering and there's a whole spiritual realm Beyond this excetera excetera that nobody here is going to die even though they die they don't. You know so he's asking to see with both eyes are you going to be up next Center on the show here
 Barbershop 2 come on down
 Colorado Shakti I just met yesterday
 it's pretty good singer to sit right here
 okay
 eshakti what's your story
 hi Krishna how did you get into boxing where you from how did you get here what's your story
 so I got into bhakti
 Leon
quick plug so shy podcast
 that's right yeah with with bacta Jake out of Rochester so that's where I'm from Rochester New York Upstate and I went through a very difficult time in college now got into drugs and all sorts of illicit activity that really ruined my interior world and I went on a very long arduous confused Oliver you know North and South America journey to heal from that and
 you know so many things just in in the last little bit you did hear that I could respond to in resonance with you know like this small myopic perspective of my life and then gradually through a lot of suffering you know layers of that be
Shad works yeah and so there's been a lot of resistance to that so my question is I didn't finish answering your question first from Rochester went through Hell Fire Christians in Brazil that's a whole different story but then I landed in Delaware and 90 Mi to us in the crew there and he actually turned out of the podcast so when it really hit the fan and covid-19 cases and you brought me through a lot of the darkest times of my life so I could stay at your service
 yeah it's like whenever I lost taste for bhakti you know you guys were just didn't live with me so you know
so let's yeah so it's that's basically all right I got to and the question is I think related
 this idea because the theme of The Suffering that I really wanted was what I've come to identify as toxic shame right and this idea that I'm worthless you know I'm
 in my actual essence you know I'm not valuable and I believe that you know and the dark the deeper into that dark hole that I went into the more convinced I became of that you know and along with that all of the dreams and aspirations of my childhood became a great source of grief for me because there is this image of who I thought I was going to be that I then became the exact opposite of that is getting real deep all of a sudden
so okay so maybe we can lighten up the dark
 so this morning we heard from Vice Chase Cooper boo in the temple about the pain of Radha Rani and her separation and it made me think of this is very theme what I've what I've heard from some authorities as you know one of the deeper griefs that we have is the grief of the grief of you know dreams I don't get filled right expectations we had special is a child pretty much everything about a childhood right it's like we thought this world of paradise and we thought our parents are going to take care of everything for us and give us all the emotional it's only that we need it and none of that happened and you know so right around and meets Krishna and has the most deep exchange of love and that's torn away from her so how does she
deal with that and that's that's the essence of of my crush I wrote a whole bunch of things here but I think that's
 yes so I understand the question so you're saying that there's a type of self-loathing that we experience in this world
 that that can come about by our
 dreams not being fulfilled and then we see right around he's going through something apparently similar and also going through some kind of deep emotional and that's not a trauma but like some kind of deep emotional spiritual hurt how do we understand these two when we line these two up next to each other how do we how are they the same how are they different not exactly
 what can we how can we take shelter of of her is in particularly in this most auspicious festive
out of a point here that you know our reference point is very small right and false ego it's like we build up our whole lives you know this house of cards you like this has to work you know in my whole life I've been operating in that way even and particularly with spiritual life you know the spiritual ego that I develop it's like I have to be the one who knows everything and has it all figured out and I can finally prove the world on valid right and if that's even that is still a small reference point where is right around her reference points Krishna and that's you know
 so I also was thinking in terms of Kali Yuga being the age of Coraline apocracy Coral amongst you know are within our own self apocracy in those we want to trust such as you know what three figures and parents and
 podcast wonderful question is all
over the place but there's so many interesting things are so many Avenues we can go down I'm going to start with the First Avenue the first album that struck me it might not even answer any question that you have in there but it's pretty interesting things for me I want to talk about has anybody ever had unfulfilled desires like I'm expecting this world and it seems like the world couldn't delivers at the tip of our fingers it doesn't happen and you're almost like the first time the material world let you down can you think of that time can I share with you my most
 biggest letdown
 yeah. By the way it's not funny
 I want it
 more than anything in the world
 yeah you know it is coming coming
 big wheel
now now you guys are both wrong
 all right can I just share with you
 I wanted to be the drum major the high school marching band
 and the teacher has selected me it was a big marching band was like a high step marching band I paid the sousaphone I went to drum major camp where I learned or I learned how to spin the Mason throw the Mason conduct
 and it was meant to be the drama it was like I was a natural-born leader and I felt like it was at the tip my hands he wanted me encourage me
 and then he pulled me aside one day and said you know what I'm going through some emotional things in my life I'm quitting the right before I was about to be a senior he said I'm quitting the job there's a new director of the band that was like okay I'm so sorry is that going to affect me being the drum major
he's like what's really got nothing to do with me it's up to the new guy and the new guy wanted nothing to do with me
 and I was so
 hurt
 I quit I quit I quit band I quit marching band I quit Orchestra I was in the orchestra played by 11 I quit all that took up punk rock
 leader of the band but I think it's important to understand that there is a frustration with material life and if you look at is frustration if you just look at it as ups and downs you're going to just start to weigh out your life like yeah I'm a loser I didn't get that what but I got this but I'm a loser I didn't get that and now it's a whole thing of hit-or-miss and you it just comes with your Carm if you look at it in the more metaphysical way
but as devotees of Lord Krishna we see that everything that we have is for our growth and so every time something gets chopped or taken away we see it as a blessing in the same way as you chop down there about to chop down the berries in there at our house because the berries are they've given their fruit and they got a shop back the Woody the Woody stems of all the raspberry and what's that going to do you just ruined it you've chopped it no it's actually going to enhance its growth it's going to hit enhance the fragrance of the flowers it's going to enhance the the beauty that comes in the spring so as a devotee all of our loss is looked at as
 a higher Gardener is doing the director of The Garden of Your Life The Garden Gardner of Europe, your car was not there just with highs or lows and and and sometimes it feels like and we can look back probably now thank God I got fired thank God he left me or she left
thank God my heart was broken thank cuz it made me dig deeper for something much better than that was there so that's what I started going with that your frustration in the material world like I wanted this it seemed like I was going to get it I didn't get it and as as theists actually because if I if I go back to bitterness you should understand that's a type of atheism you like that house elf because you don't understand that that the God is actually benevolent that's how and so
 oh God I thought that Joker when I laugh so that was one part and also now one other thing I was going to send this jumped out of me too but sometimes if there is at this is very calm
and you know that I'm a I'm more of like a a botanist than a therapist but part-time I learn all my body from apps apps with therapist and more stuff
 but often times get there something band in it in a childhood in and these these formative years of our life then this lack of self-confidence lack of self-worth always trying to prove to somebody prove to a parental figure group route to a fatherhood figure prove to an elder brother elder sister on her uncle we carry that in transfer into our don't like this, thanks and so and because a person was there never to give us that validations a child I'm desperately searching for that validation as an adult cuz anybody understand what I mean say hairy ball okay have everybody is also
not just me and not just you my friend so in it in in in trying to connect that no matter what I achieve even the greatest things I achieved it always feels like it's not enough I'm just can't do it I can't carry that voice with us to relationships we carry with us to the workplace and we suffered tremendously because of it
 but we should understand
 that in boxes and boxes of tall order with Krishna we are talk about this in the car today every seed of material desire has to be burned out of our heart and so there's a lot of like going back and forth like maybe this maybe this ladder is too tall to climb maybe this is just too much for me maybe I should just give it all I'm not good at any of this anyway I just gave this for me this isn't the real thing I just got to just settle back into my my old life which I was comfortable with no there always will be attention that you can do better and don't feel
never get to the top it's always you always feel that I'll never be even the greatest most evolved beings never think like I made it I'm enlightened no one feels like that unless they're full of it the real genuine say to see them sometime so far I see myself as so tiny and so much distance while I need to go further that will always be there at 3 she ate that tension don't be like I can't get it so I'm just going to give up on it never go there never go there always understand there's a tension I can do more and that's okay
 where we're going for Progress not Perfection go for Progress today even though progress means one little inch forward
 what else did you extract from it was a fast
what you shared the let's let's start here
 it said that this material world is like a reflection and the nature of the reflection if you from the right angle is that what's reflected is upside down right like if you're sitting on one side of a lake and you're looking at something on the other side of it when you see the reflection of it in the lake it will appear upside down
 and so what's the lowest here's kind of the highest there
 and so what's in what sense are Louis experience experience is here of experiences of self-loathing
 Woodward Radha Rani is experiencing is the polar opposite
 although it may appear the same right like the things in the mirror kind of appear the same but they're actually completely different that's the nature of Reflections would you look at it. Same as either backwards it's either backwards or upside down
 so are feeling
self-loathing are due to ignorance of Who We Are
 but if we actually understood who we are we wouldn't feel that at all but we have a mind that's been impressed with all kind of
 false ideas about who we are we identify with the body we identify with the mind and because of that we feel depression and self-loathing and fear and it said all the negative emotion now looks like he's experiencing the same thing she's crying
 you know I am down
 and she's feeling the original left yet and controllable Krishna left
 Krista does this every time he comes to the person that is the dearest and closest to him right round does a casita
 Krishna does it Toronto
 write a message to Tanya he takes in your ass if you wanted to talk please his mother and his wife behind
he's
 it although it looks like he's insensitive
 is actually this is what this is what the the real deep sages say those that really have the ability to see the past time in their mind feel it in their heart experience the emotions that are going in the Lila they say that this is his way of immersing them in the deepest feelings of love
 that appear externally to be pain but are actually the greatest deepest ecstasy and sometimes they use there's really no material analogy they can use that works perfectly but sometimes they use analogy of dry ice and dry ice you don't see it in the world too much anymore but
 during our times we try ice is all over the place
 but yeah it is dry ice is I think they would make ice cream with
I think so he's like a rock concert you know how to make smoke come up
 on and a silly but like you turn inside a thing that had dry ice around something like that
 but it's like this block of ice that if you touch it you burn
 right away it appears like it should cool but actually touching you burn
 what is dry ice
 yes Frozen carbon dioxide Frozen carbon dioxide gas
 so that didn't help at all. So that's the first thing
but then you mentioned something like she is God Krishna as her reference point and we've got our mind as a reference points and that's the problem this is the nature of the material energy that is this if we want understand
 the nature of the world we live in and that includes our body and even our own mind they're all made of material energy and the nature material energy is that it's up one moment and down the next it's always shifting always shifting always shifting whatever you grab onto here it may seem like it's something that that that that's that's firm and steady that you can that you can kind of make yourself to this material know for sure
 that it's just a matter of time again we talked about time I just downloaded it and it's installed that that shelter that you have that anchor that you have will disintegrate
 and so we have a fantasy how much we experience that fantasy that dream
that that will be realized according to the Merit that we've achieved in the previous life or in this life right that's Karma we have a desire and according to how much Good Karma Merritt we've accumulated in our bank account we may experience that kind of tree we're looking at someone else said that's what I want I want to be on the stage or whatever it is I want an essentialist wanting to take Christmas real I want to be the center of attention the center of a faction that sent you the most famous the wealthiest and most powerful of those kind of we want that position we're trying to play it out in the virtual reality according to our Karma we get a more powerful experience of that and even that, runs out and even if we get it it's still
 the illusory energy that doesn't satisfy the self so ultimately have to get back to that we have to get back to that but we can do that
 buy directly take
because the ideas at Rada is she's crushed as energy
 she's a personification of one of Christmas Energies
 and that's called the technical word is letting eshakti but it means it's the
 she is the personification of the potency that gives the highest pleasure and what is the highest pleasure in life
 love so she's in a sense you could say she's the personification of divine love and anyone that has Divine love receives it through her
 and the nature of one whose experience in Divine love is that they just they there's no Envy
 there's no jealousy and so and the love is so deep like her love for Krishna so deep that she wants him to experience more and more of the pleasure that drives to love so she's like this person it you know it
this person is actually has love for you you should connect with them she's pulling people to Krishna normally in this world we're trying to block people out and I love you more than anyone and don't forget it
 and she's like this person loves you more than I do you you need to you know it's so so therefore
 and have those kind of the cuz it's cuz it's real love and that's why when we going to the lake will go to the temple near Watseka Avenue you see not just Krishna see Krishna and Radha
 because we approach him through her
 so we may you know we may struggle with all kind of
 with all kind of mental
 suffering
 wish but we have the knowledge not that it doesn't necessarily instantly disappear
at least theoretically we have the knowledge that I'm experiencing something in the mind that's very different than my own nature which is underneath just that knowledge right there is a tremendous Boon right that's a tremendous Boon now even what I suffer
 can now begin to work for me because it is breaking my face that I'm going to find happiness through the body or through the material energy and then you pray to Radha you chanted when we chant what are we changing WeChat Hari Krishna that's Radha Krishna Radha Krishna that's our that's our Focus that's our a meditation that's our objective of a focus is not just Krishna Radha and Krishna and you bring your mind there through the name through thin through the temple at DD through here in the past I'm sore and they're leaving and you let that you let her enter
kind of takeover
 ask a question good series of questions
 what snake I know I run away but sneak another one in what do you say I tell you I want to start a losing it because or you're picking up you know why because you're like you asked this question what is the highest pleasure and of course it was a lot but I was thinking of what is the highest pleasure
 my my my mine went to
 what is the highest place I can buy a feather Maybe
 I was not thinking pure love at all
all right oh God
 just need to come on down
 welcome JC talk right into the microphone said here where you from tells your story look right look at yourself and then talk right in the mic
 so my dad was in the military so kind of from all over the East Coast exclusively the east coast and he's in the Navy so Maryland Virginia Louisiana Rhode Island and New Jersey
 and then I first came to Bucky yoga when I took teacher training in 2020 at Veda yoga
 I came here and there's a beautiful woman a coup me and she was like okay so there's the Thursday spiritual world over there and then we are over here in the
material world and there's there's material heaven and there's the middle realm and then there's the lower planets and then here we are in the middle planet and we can only go over here to the spiritual planets if we start from the middle planets are we are now this is interesting like this girl is really interesting like I I'm not sure I really believe this but like it's super interesting to listen to
 and you're being a straight-A student I was just an atheist
 San Jose yeah that's cool but like I'm an atheist so she took me to meet to get a boo and he convinced me otherwise pretty quickly
 you're like you're at your atheism was like the target of his battering ram yes that was the highest pleasure actually
 those beautiful beautiful story and I have no Yume been around awhile here
I'd like a staple pillar here at the studio and so what's up how come you serve you
 so having come through video guy I've heard people sometimes speak about Mission drift and iskcon is so my question is how would you respond to people that say maybe you shouldn't teach yoga Asana alongside bhakti yoga
 I think you should teach brought to yoga alongside with everything
 I used to teach it in the punk rock scene which was filled with a bunch of people that hated God
 and you know what it caused conversation if not debates people through to meet at my van when we are on tour
 and I think everybody should be spoken to about spiritual life everything is really I think it's a really thing what to do if you care about somebody and I think people would say that may have a short-sighted vision
what it means to be human in this world we interact with people all the time you know and I don't think it's a bad thing and of course you teach your yoga is part of the whole day and culture are you kidding yoga benefits people in so many ways physically emotionally psychologically and I think sometimes people don't always want to hear the absolute truth they just want to feel better in their body and they want their mind to be pacified as a teacher yoga teacher they want to know that you care about them too I think it's a great way to nurture person as far as me is it cuz I'm young a teacher to
 I meant I'm not going to give everybody you know the highest thing if they're not looking for it at the same time you know they just might just want a friend at this point in their life and I can I can do that for them and you could be that for them at the same time in my heart of hearts I know that everybody wants deep connection to source
they don't want a girlfriend I want a boyfriend I don't want a good job still want those things but it's not going to give them what their heart actually wants because I know people to create jobs and Greg girlfriends and they still are missing something deeper and so in my heart of hearts I know that's the ultimate hand holding their hand with God and I should say I see that in every person's face I say so and you can carry that with you a devotee will carry that with them in are in any space a yoga class at Jiu-Jitsu class in a HTC Jitsu also why not they're they're we're bonding in a certain way share with them about you know they might not have signed up for Spiritual information
 but often if they come to a yoga class I'll tell people all about all different things just like who made it to you why
the yoga class and you actually sign up for it especially if you sign up for a teacher training you got it at least understand where this at least you got to least academically understand where this stuff is coming from and in the context of it so I think in yoga maybe more than anything but I think it should always be given to those who are eager to learn and of course due to your own Purity since Saturday a personal discipline and the way you treat yourself the way you treat others that will encourage people that do want to find out like man what does this guy have I want with this guy has a real way of sharing with other people is not even just speak it's just to live if you can live a spiritual life people want to hear from you cuz they want to inquire like how do you have that
 that's beautiful yeah I mean I'd love to just be there for people that's what Kumi was for me was 2020 it was the pandemic I took it with Tracy who's in the eye
and so we did the first week online and then all of a sudden we had seven weeks that was just structure and I was like somewhere to be it was We're All in This Together what's happening and so when I reflect I'm just like it's really because Kumi showed me so much friendship and love and just personal attention she just shine your light on me I think that's the mission I think that's the mission to get in traffic that's the actual Mission I think institutions have to start understanding that's where it should be drifting to you know that's the actual mission is to connect with people and every facet of their their their personal being including their soul
 but you got to share anything just say
 it's one thing if you took the temple on with zika Avenue and turn it into a yoga studio
 then maybe you call that mission drift right like but it'd be another thing of people go there get inspired and in exactly is your say
take boxing into whatever realm they exist in including Logan and you always like an obvious one
 you know if you want the prophets had to kind of thing you know there was prepared one disciple that was teaching yoga to the daughter of the shop Iran
 and you so pleased by it he was just like oh look he's through yoga he's reaching you know important world leaders and so he was all for it he didn't say no no no this Mission drift just do it like this so really you know that the temple should be a temple it should it should be it should follow this The Vedic standards you know if the property stablished we should go there we should learn things we should learn the right way we should have the rituals are in practice in the authentic why that should all be very authentic and we should all be so inspired by that
 that we go out and take that energy and and manifested in the world and unlimited ways and
we should you know get people to space to do with their own creativity you know and if we can do better than just to a better unit like another was the real the real way to show is it going to get better so let's just let everybody do what they do and see what works you're living proof he's doing it to help thanks so much for the gas for lunch thanks keep doing what you do a boo it's good to have you
