 okay Runner
 nuggets this is from the American Psychological Association
is an interview with Tim cassar a professor of psychology at Knox College in a former editor of the APA Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and the American Psychological Association American Psychological Washington DC is the largest scientific or Professional Organization representing psychology the United States APA membership includes nearly 130,000 researchers education clinicians consultants in students Sons cycle series are mice be serious but they are question was what does psychological research say about materialism link
 happiness a little paws there a nice little paws psychological research say about materialism linked to happiness you were Tim says the connection between materialism and well-being is the longer
standing strand of research in materialism literature
 my colleagues at the University of Sussex and I recently published a meta-analysis that show the negative relationship between materialism and well-being and was considered consistent across all kinds of measures of materialism types of people and cultures we found at the more highly people endorse materialistic values the more the experience unpleasant emotions depression and anxiety the more than reported physical health problems such as stomach aches and headaches and the less they experienced Pleasant emotions and felt satisfied with their lives
 interesting huh
 the most supported explanation for why well-being is lower when materialism is high concerns psychological needs again
what's the Ford explanation for why well-being is lower when the trailer is Miss High concerns psychological needs specifically materialistic values or associated with what with with living one's life in ways that you were relatively poor job of satisfying psychological needs to feel free competent and connected to other people but people do not have their needs well satisfied they report lower levels of well-being and happiness as well as more distress thank you Rhonda. Where do you dig out these gems you're like an archaeologist you know that I searched for them you search for those gems that is really like I'm like one of those Hogs looking for truffles you know got a big snout you're like Lord bore Bravo
the servant of Lord for this is making me rethink what I'm going to get Mara for Kris for her birthday not her than materialistic going to ask what but you know is she is not materialistic woman has no material desires trying to figure her out but you know course
 wisdom literature is from all different spiritual Traditions have been telling us this for a long time but it's backed up by scientific research you know that that external things will not satisfy sin the more that were convinced that they will the more that we suffer
 and we see it you know we look at you look at this look at you take take yours
birds in your bezos's senior Elon Musk and Bill Gates and you look at their lives
 and I don't mean to get on that person writing but it's like are they happier than just any other random person that I pull out of a crowd you know I was just going to say you know they go through the same things that everyone else goes to they go through a divorce so you know and in all that they accumulate you don't like I just look at it this way like take some like that that's accumulated so much more wealth
 like one Jeff Bezos has as much wealth as like how many millions of people is like
 so should we have millions of times more happiness right you know what was it and what if you took all that wealth and saw where it actually went like well I bought this big man
but actually don't live in it and I just spend more money kind of like maintaining you know and then I'm living over in this Mansion but as I can see you all the time would we have this big thing cuz you want to impress people with big parties every now and then you know we actually never had those parties and when we did was a disaster was like a terrible night and you work hard for this wealth but where does it end up going how does it how does it actually connect to my feelings of feeling more satisfied and happy in this world and it just doesn't add up
 yeah you can that be Pious with wealth but you really got to train yourself because that having such an incredible opulence can really put you in deep illusion it's a real it becomes a real good, could be a real problem to finding sure you can just say you're there you're almost there keep going get crazy or get Wilder get
you're getting weirder you know it does happen it really does happen you know what I used to teach yoga in Beverly Hills of all places and I used to teach literally private a Mansion 2 Mansion 2 Mansion 2 mansion that was my you know days in Los Angeles I don't know how I ended up there but I ended up there and I used to drive and I used to look at like there's all these like driving down Crescent Drive in the 700 block of Crescent Drive in the 600 block of Crescent Drive you just see like incredible cars and incredible homes in and then you see this
 piece of junk pickup truck with like a bunch of most likely Mexican worker in this truck and they've got like bags of oranges and they're eating their lunch short of like Annabelle and I was just like these guys are actually having fun
I'm laughing in the truck eating they're going to the houses that are there they're landscaping and they're picking all the fruit from the trees and the guys would like the app none of those people even want the fruit from the trees and they all have the orange trees and grapefruit trees and pomelo tree is in guava trees and they're just picking the brutes and they're just hanging with their friends and their got their hands on the earth and I was thinking I want landscape I want a garden with these so let me get this if you could have the Mansion or the job picking the I want to be happy in these Mansions I know you want to be happy
 which one can I listen I would take I live in like a huge mansion I don't care about it I don't need this I'd like you know what I'm happiest when we are all over the house when it says every room is packed down that's what I'm a happiest that's what the research always goes to 2 is that in and I think it was kind of alluded to hear that.
we were to say that you don't feeling satisfied free confident connected to other people that are oranges are having a good time you know I had a great time last night you know why I was cooking like a credible feast in the kitchen to Rocco and true my two boys were playing redundant and I was working on new Melody's the saying the deities and he was just in his booty Bliss in the background cheering it just to hear my two sons play more done. It was such a fatherly when I felt like my heart was filled with so much joy last night
 it was an amazing it wasn't it wasn't it was your Bible you were in the kitchen things my younger son doesn't like to break from the rules apply
number down. The older Sons I know you got a break a little try new things and he got to embellish and he's like no no no I don't want to just make up Beats I want to I want to do exactly my teacher tells me it was adorable it was most adorable thing ever is beautiful it's just nice way that one down the day with some kirtan the way it is right in in in one place it's like a political disaster and there's suffering another place a little babies being born and another place you know kids are grown up and play more dunga and whatever we're going through whether it's a sweet thing or if you know how heartbreaking thing this philosophy you know I found through this fucking Josh tradition of the Bhagavad Gita and a bag of time it carries you through it it helps you always grow through it you know and yes I didn't mean to be leaving diminish
we're all leaving into Krishna wherever we are in good times and bad times exactly what I'm feeling love when I'm feeling desperation I call out right now to Ramon

 all right brother oh yeah reading for Tom Canto seven chapter 13 text 30k so now this affect the python man here he's going to share so I don't know if I can get to it today but he's going to share two of his gurus in a minute but he's building up to that and he's kind of shown like I was observing the world and I was kind of seeing that exactly what the American Psychological Association probably spent all kinds of funding to figure out who spent Millions to figure out the materialism it is not good
well that's what he figured out just lying on the ground how's your study Mister python man well I got it all figured everybody would stuff is not necessarily happy okay let's hear what he has to say you go to India and children running around in a parent's squalor
 and they don't need a a drone they don't need a various video game they're playing with a stick and an old wheel when it came in on and bring that they play with the stick in the whole thing done do something
 oh yeah. It's like we need your help badly done. It is a bark or something just hit that thing with his kind of jumped over there
and then yeah and that's enough to keep you satisfied they say that fun begins when the kid gets bored let him get bored and that jeep that's where you get that is that from your second Waldorf thing of Waldorf dad Grandad I was like listen podcast the link for that I was struggling share it on our was in the sages not just here but on the
 AR platform what you got to come up with a good name for the okay for it you can both for an hour I was saying what what is the red that I said well my father he was not rad
Sara Lee but he was a great dad at we just had he had a lot of boundaries he was very responsible he I felt loved but at the same time it is screwed around at all he was affectionate but not super affectionate he wasn't my best friends like some people have the same age as my best friend definitely was not like that he would give us these ultimate if I get out of the house don't come back till like like you're in your like throw that you're going to have to figure out what to do if no one's home on your street there was a play date we can get chauffeured around to a play date that didn't exist just went out you just went out and you figure it out okay. You know what I did I had a I had a shovel I would dig that sounds like trouble backyard and it play in the holes if no one was out like a like a grave kind of hole like that kind of see what happens if we put the dirt on top of them
in the whole okay
 the living at this first. He just yesterday we read the verse where the the python man said to Pearl and he recognized it just like a deer out of ignorance they can't see that there's water underneath the grass cuz it's covered by the grass
 and then to go running around searching for water when it's right there so simerly you know what we do is we go looking all over for happiness you got to do is right here it's right here you got to take that heart got a shovel and dig dig holes that started that the take there's there's your quote for the day and I was at your like a dig at your Naki Alia said yourself cuz it's right inside
 alright text 30
the living entities the living entity tries to achieve happiness and rid himself of the cause of distress but because of the various bodies of the living entities are because of the try this again living entity that's the spiritual tries to achieve happiness and rid himself of the causes of distress but because the various bodies of the living entities are under the full control of material nature yes all their plans in different bodies one after another are ultimately baffled and get what you want if it is time for your karma and ask if there's going to be a situational Karma
 situational, there's a Karma of a country a Karma of a town a Karma of a village and a caramel of a family as well as a Karma of an individual that Collective, also that we're dealing with
Damaris, we're dealing with it the Township's Carm of the states, New York state has a Karma to it right with the python mean it's kind of sharing you is that it's like it doesn't matter how hard you work
 to create your prosperous situation like even you may achieve it
 that still doesn't change the fact that you're living in an incredibly vulnerable vehicle called the body there he goes again he has no abundance mentality vulnerable that's the problem with you can still buy a phone Larry Moorhead there's a couple things in the commentary should check in on he says as soon as a living entities victim listen to it as soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires we kind of when we see a person with strong materials are say hey look at his horrific okay
he really wants it as soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires to Lord it over material nature I want to take the material energy and make it mine and make it work for me he subjected to the control of material nature that's it that's the Paradox material Nature's Maya Devi Durga Devi down good luck charms Scott a Garland of skulls and one of yours is looking out as soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires to Lord it over material nature
 is subjected to the control the material nature which is supervised by The Supremes Soul the result is that one again and again makes plans and is baffled
 but as foolish as he is he cannot see the cause of his bafflement
 doing the same damn thing
I got it Life After Life I can make this work for me and then ultimately is baffled if people don't believe in life Life After Life is looking into it shorter terms and that Fibonacci spiral the micro micro Circle that we get back up again and again in this lifetime we see that and we don't we don't stop back in here the message that the hey there's a system there's a manual to figure this out you know the proper services to this gives us a good picture this wheel of Karma and some Sarah our activities keep us going on this will we go up and down and up and down you know the Munsters for these problems don't get it again I did I can't believe I did that again how did the time was I thinking I did it again for the we get there by Pius X, right one is elevated to the higher planetary systems you get better material circumstances and by Empire rated to lower species of life
he is punished by the laws of nature
 in the lower species of life we all have been there
 in the lower species of life there's an evolutionary process he's explaining how it works over here right now baby because they just had a baby and they're on the podcast that's amazing but now they need you to remind me to focus on the baby and said they got the baby if they don't need your help in the lower species of life there's an evolutionary process and when the term of the living entities imprisonment or punishment in the lower species is finished
 then he again is offer to human form and give it a chance to decide for himself which way he should plan that he's spelling out how the universe
text Ray okay you cut you've been through many different by you going to this automatic evolutionary process and now you're born as a human to get now you have the chance right at the Junction now you have the chance to decide for yourself what kind of planet am I going to make if you again mrs. the opportunity he is again put into the cycle of birth and death going sometimes high or sometimes lower turning on the samsara chakra the wheel of material existence as the wheel sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down the stringent laws of material Nature Made the living entity material existence sometimes happy
 sometimes just dress that's how this is what the body what time offer is it offers an access point out of that wheel kids would do this and they go down a hill now there is no way to get out of that it's like going nonstop balancing very dangerous thing to do
but if you could get out of that if some of you all of a sudden you just hit something happens it just disrupt that flow of the wheel or the tire get out that that's what a bona fide yoga system is that's what the bog of a time is it's an access point out of stopping making the same horror mistakes the same poor choices again and again not just for this time people for the lifetimes of board poor choices right this is what the bog time offers a different option
 otherwise we're just we are just Bound by a wheel of karma
 will we hear more about that right now we're going to text 31 it says if I read ahead
 this is your pie right ahead but your listed activities are always mixed with three kinds of material conditions Mara misery Mara three types of miseries without looking at the doubt looking
what are those three even if the Chiefs some success by performing such activities what is the benefit of this success what is still subjected to birth death old age disease and the reactions of this fruitive activity so this is the idea once you're in a body you get one of these three these are the one of them things
 Russia has a picture that trident represent the Pitchfork write each of these problems represents one of these pains that you got once you get a body and one is I need Divac aright the elements the elements are punishing the body needs a few hot oh my God it's too hot in here cuz someone put on the AC
it's too cold in here open the window it's too cold in here and the living until he goes back and forth is too hot it's too cold it's too hot to cold it's too humid is it going to flood has been a tornado right whatever your own body is causing you pain like a man I got a I got a splinter in my foot or I've got like a indigestion or I got heart palpitations and I've got asthma my own body is causing me a problem I got a headache or there's a third one already. Make us some other odd man out there is causing me how you know he's like this guy punched me in the nose you know I missed the Invaders are coming to take over my land or there's a step in a hornet's nest I got bit all over I got a dog when I was talking about these like Zuckerberg and challenging each other to like
MMA cage my house but I favor that but that's it that's it like even you got all the money in the world someone's going to come around and try to embarrass you or try to let you know it's just like and I would love to fight Bill Gates do you hate him
 I don't like was dealing with the Monsanto and so you want to go bye-bye at Farmland not into that so you want to get violent with him
 well yeah cuz if you wants to go there how to take it to the cage with the Bill Gates I think I could take him I'm not in the best of shape right now but I think I could take this is what prophet says in the commentary to this place built the prophet said anything about MMA in this nothing okay at least not directly even if a car me a materialist is successful and accumulating some material well he still
I'll enjoy it for you must die in bereavement
 decide if your materialistic this is good that I'm going to die in bereavement I have promises I've even seen a dying man begging a medical attendant to increase his life by four years
 so that he could complete his material plans
 of course for years give me four years of course the medical man was unsuccessful and expanding the life of the man who therefore died and great bereavement everyone must die in this way and after one's mental condition is taken into account by the laws of material nature
 mental condition meeting once desires and so on he is given another chance to fulfill his Desires in a different body material plans for material happiness have no value but under the spell of the illusory energy we consider them extremely valuable I got these plans are going to make it happen this is what life is all about in Philly
get it to it I'm going to make these adjustments and I'm going to be happy and this is so important here's the interesting twist to this the whole block twist
 sometimes we get obsessed with these 1% these trolling puppeteers of the material world and is One World when they caught the
 world global World some of the Illuminati. Here's the interesting thing you can't be happy just with extreme wealth
 you can only be happy if you understand the gounis if you understand that the mode of goodness makes you happy then you'll be happy you can be criminal in one sense and maybe not actually because honesty is part of being in the motor goodness suck dick to be the speak truth
part of being in the motive goodness but happiness makes you in the motive goodness don't think you're getting cheated by anyone just get to this point of sattva and you'll be happy in this world and of course the world is temperature even if you're suck dick you'll be less affected by those three out of that mocha Automotive got a guy Vaca but once you're in Rajasthan Thomas you're overwhelmed by those things you are like there's greed. Happy what's your filled with desires you can't be happy they're not getting over on you you're not being cheated you just get to supper and you win if the goal is to be happy just get to sattva and you went to but we want more than that what we want more than that but I'm just saying if people fear like others he's wealthy guys are controlling everything my landlord's happier than me and you know these people living on this block of Beverly Hills are happier than me then and then no it's not that it's all these other things that we spoke of earlier
Community it's song it's eating together it's family it's coming to you know is it's saying it's reading wisdom literature together it's applying wisdom literature to any situation in life right it's not just having a big house will gets a crap a big house means big problems they say well know that you got enough money to take care of those problems it gets exhausting
 just it's just more and more worries and put an especially here
 this purse is going to that and it probably is going to that point where like the fact is in a very short time your is going to be all taken away
 and then if you're attached to Vic then you suffer when things get taken with if you're sucking dick and you lose things you're like what was never mind right you have that feeling has never mind anyway and I don't need it to be happy we have such a good philosophy here we have spirituality
 landscape of philosophy lifestyle
culture just hearing my kids talk about the returned yesterday I was like I know nothing about this to talk about a different ways to hit them redundant I was like they know a whole nother Krishna Consciousness I don't even know that rock was getting training that you never got just by living in Alachua I know I know I know I know there's a wisdom to what the python man is saying and there's a practical way that we can reflect on at the other like if you'd like everybody but then I'm just looking at you wrong and I said like to look around you going to eat you look around you
 and all the other side so that's you know that they're your possessions right
 realize that in a short time is all to be taken away from you and and we're all going to hit a point like we just a little Lila come into in the world today we're all about
go out of this world as well we don't know exactly when but it's coming and it's not too far down the road we're all going to leave this win at that time even if you've been very successful at accumulating stuff and manipulating stuff
 is all going to be gone and you're going to be as helpless as like a leaf floating down of a rapid flowing river you know what you're going to get carried
 you know you do. You're going to have no anchor to hang on to your your soul is going to be there without anything from this world to hold on to and are you going to be ready for that moment when that moment comes which is coming are you going to be like I've got I have my spiritual anchor I'm okay I'm fine everything you do and you're going to be able to live in that moment fearlessly
 are you going to die in bereavement in fear and get carried helplessly into the next body will you play the same game
name of up and down and up and down again
 remind me of it is happens it can happen at any time I was just talking to a person I'm not going to name cuz I'm not sure he wants to say the neighbor we should get on the show he's married to one of the people who's on the zoom today right now kind of figure it out but anyway he grew up in here and when the Ayatollah came to power
 and he was 2 years old and it was sort of like the parents were like grab that they were a wealthy family and the and the parents were like okay get we're leaving everything behind and we're running for our lives and they and they and they had they were smuggled out of the country smuggled to Pakistan smuggle my father had to start over he was like two master's degrees was from a wealthy family and how it was delivering pizza you know to
minute the material world could do a hairpin turn and if we're situated at Krishna is my Lord I own nothing I'm here to serve
 this is the way we can deal with with with all of this stuff it's not by accumulating about accumulating regret week we can lose that any minute anyway it's a better investment the better return on investment is investing your spiritual life
 what do you call that retarded why are you know why the best Roi is invest in your spiritual self your spiritual life or spiritual connection and that's what a matter that's a very poor investment
 your net worth is not your worth
 your net worth your net worth is not your worth your worth is your contribution to the whole okay your your net worth is just your next stop
 who cares
 people
we're sick of our stuff everybody's sick of their stuff
 like okay, stuff and get a new stuff
 no that one down there everyone is sick of their stuff everybody gets rid of the Americans that by somebody and your they're picking up their stuff and they're finding goodies in the dump we love it we're always finding the enough stuff Laura being a says Ruby in Philadelphia
 all right I am next next verse this is going to show where it goes even said that whole death thing that's coming along side for a second
 X32 the barometer continued
 I'm actually seeing how a rich man who is a victim of a census
 is very greedy to accumulate wealth and there or suffers from an
Omnia do the fear from all sides despite his wealth and opulence insomnia
 I can't sleep I can't sleep I called call Tia I loved her neither and I'm not being able to attain sleep
 it was a time I had a lot of money and I remember the stock market crash
 I just lost a lot of money it's such a better the time I had no money so that's exactly what it was just like I'm not affected by it when you have that's why was he was traveling with those with that assistant who had all the gold coins on him
 did remember is that get rid of all those gold coins he said he might need them you never know he's like get rid of the gold coins invite problems you know it's
brilliant what we're going to get there probably in our next class but he's going to say I have these two groups that I learned from one is the bee
 and one is a python are you doing a spoiler here maybe I mean a little trailer should I should I not reveal it but what if you open up that surprise package I'll give a clue just a clue okay but what you just said about the stock market relates to one of those animals because the idea what the stock market is like you may do so much work and spent years building up that portfolio you just gave the whole analogy way you said the B stock market what do you think it's going to be
 what you think Abby is doing why do okay then let me put you on the hot seat Brothers why how does the B relate to them in stock market he makes honey so and then
The Beekeeper comes and takes all the honey exactly right so you can you work so hard to accumulate something and you actually never even get the chance to enjoy it and then it's a good beekeeper leave a little bit of honey bees but that's the thing where you and bees are like it's a great analogy Crosby's are so industrious industrious going out of the crate a comb how did they create that, it's unbelievable the representing the simple person right cuz they just take a little from here and they take a little from there but here the B is more like the industrious materialist where they work so hard to accumulate so much and they create honey right like this most incredible like beautiful sweet you know the substance and then some of this comes along and takes it all away before they even have a chance to enjoy it you know like I'm saying
