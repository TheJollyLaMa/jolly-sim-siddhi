 anyway get her out of there
 we are ready for gopher. He'll cited
all right there's some different nugget today we're going to do a little reading if they're real of something
 when he explained where it's from and I just picked I wanted to get this book for a long time
 it's been a little bit hard to get but I found it and I bought it this morning the street toughest entire bajiba goswami
 going to say something about the sundarbans well I can read something about him right here if you want or need it explains many sitting there was right and they were all written by G6 sundarbans and then there's a promise and Darby which is sometimes called the seven sundara
 and these are books I mean you know I sent Harbor is is similar to like a like a Garland in a sense it it means that what what is the toughest and Argo is written by the one of the six goswami zevran dominant you know if if you listen to
podcast all the time and your antibody you really have to learn who the 6 Plus why I'm so we really need to begin to provide more of that education youngest of the 6th goswami is a random he was the nephew of group and Sonata or the senior senior since he was considered the greatest philosopher in this Lane and the SATs and our business 6th and Arby's they they are six different books which are the deepest a box where he's drawing from the srimad bhagavatam and other ancient texts
 to establish the clear understanding of what Bob what time is presenting and ends in a sense what he's doing is also establishing this lineage is understanding through that
 and so Tapas and Arby's the first of them and really the the basis of
listen Darby is it a lot of it is just to establish how important and significant
 predominant the srimad bhagavatam is how how authoritative it is how is actually the highest rated Authority the most complete Revelation from Sylvia Steve are they difficult and heady to read and deeply philosophical yes is it a little different than my Amar chitra Katha comic books and he was he passed away maybe six that he was a great great Soul who lived it
turn on hill and was a great Sanskrit scholar and a great philosopher and he did wonderful translations of that person. I'm Rita books of the coastline is that a real important work so I've been looking forward to getting this sentence I was reading his
 preface he wrote the preface to it and I just thought I thought it would be nice to read Because here he's speaking in a bit about what the human body with time is and it's where you from it every day so I thought that the listeners might be interested to hear some of this good what are you doing
 foot massage with some coconut oil ask what I'm doing but I don't think you could say I'm going to spread coconut oil all over the room and there's like usual out of clothes
on the walls of a hotel
 I cover my plane you got to get a little closer to the mic through the closed door parts at speak a special about what the Barbara Thomas but we might hear a little bit about who's Eva goswami is or what the sadar Bazar to start from beginning Shirley SRI Swami the author bhagavat sandarva also is known as the formidable scholar and the most important the illusion of the vysnova School founded by SRI chaitanya mahaprabhu but he was also a brilliant inspired poet as evidenced by his other Masterpiece the gopal shampoo at the gopal chump was a big stick book that's all Christians Leela's songs Christian Fast Times
 this is a book about dance philosophy like a more like a
more like hell yeah what what is what's the word I'm looking for the treaties in or Like A Treatise here he also did his he also did let them find the actual info about it but he also made his own practice of studying Sanskrit yes he did the idea was you can get lost and get absorbed in Sanskrit I can deviate you from your bhakti so he made a way to study Sanskrit where every like syllable is a name of Krishna like a Krishna conscious versus iron and scrap of Coolio
 but his greatest attribute was his Ardent Devotion to Sri chaitanya
 what you turn your heart and lives selfless devotion to the Supreme and perfect object of love the young Coward of her diving Krishna and so jeeva born into a family of David Krishna father
and showing their and showing their same enthusiasm from his earliest years took as his mission in life to reveal Krishna as the Supreme Lord and give intelligent spiritually inclined people solid reasons to become attracted to him ideas in the bhagavad-gita are that's a book spoken by Krishna but his most complete biography is found in the Bog about piranhas in the cement block of town known as she would Bob timer simply part of a tongue
 typically for major piranhas cuz there's like 18 major products right typically from major piranha she discusses many things beginning with the creation of the material world and the genealogies of demigods sages and the Royal lines coming from the gods of the Sun and the Moon
that's all that we've been reading about within this framework of universal history more than 3,000 humans and celestials are described or mentioned
 you could call them
 I would call them
 Ancient Aliens and more than 30 avatars of Lord Vishnu
 but the center of attention for this piranha is also as also for the bug of agita is its namesake by Levon the opulent Lord the title Shi bhagavan as used in the Bog of a Time applies most properly to the Avatar who appears some how many generations do you think after birth
 Krishna.
 Take a wild guess
 much less than I would have thought cuz some of those early but they have very long night time so I guess going
I don't know
 I mean the title baghban is used in bogra Tom applies most properly to the Avatar who Pierce M60 Generations after the Creator Broomall in the lunar dynasty of the British nice Krishna the son of mustard in the tenth of the ball with x 12 kantos is entirely dedicated to Christmas life and this part comprises 90 chapters out of a total 325 so it's not quite as third but it's close to 3rd and 10th gantos
 the back of the back of a piranha however is not just a compilation of Life histories
 it also elaborately presents the Theology of vaishnava devotion of of yoga this theology however is not
presented in a linear systematic way
 but mostly
 through the medium of prayers offered to Krishna and other avatars and also threw another Gita this one spoken by Christian two
 what if I went in the 11th Canticle the good of Akita it was nice to
 a nice concise description with the bug bug with time consists of there
 is Bright's although each of the four major schools advice to visit has it's important Sanskrit commenters instrument Bob with Tom
 I'm some schools as vaishnavas him give more attention to Beyonce Dave's vedanta sutras the more to that than to the human body time a different emphasis a rose however about five hundred years ago when SRI chaitanya from Galva device none of us regardless Christian self reborn to teach the
have his own names advised his followers to study and discuss bog of a Time
 citing various other piranhas he honored she made valve time as the natural commentary on the sutures of a Dunta a commentary by their author be a slave himself so he was saying he was quoting other products that were speaking about the show me about Tom and through that demonstrating that you might think that they don't Asutra is the most important part of USA's philosophy
 but the bottom is actually the commentary on be done to Sutra written by the author gave himself the all through the day. Two surgeries
 because their church and accepted the Bob Tom as a vedanta commentary none of his father's produced another commentary on the way down to sutras until Balaji Vidya bhushan a wrote the Govinda bus you three hundred years ago and seen your followers of Mohammed Abu obtrusive time to begin writing, tears in the Bible with Tom however even while he was president
the earliest quite amazing it is quite amazing how smart lord say Tanya had to be till like take all these quotes from all other all other traditions and then and then and then defeat the other Scholars he is God does things to be all-knowing emissions his head in a debate okay but the earliest of these bobtown to come to us with such a tiny amata manjusha by shrina chakravarthi not bitching at work already talked to her but she not circumcised
 followed by Sheila Sinatra Swami's by Chateau SHINee the same Sonata in the brother shuru Pogo Swami and their Associates sure the rug enough to ask Swami room rug is named after my name
they wrote original poetry and didactic works all derived from the Bob with time so they built a whole culture out of the literary culture
 I'll jump forward a little bit
 bag of ice in Darby the most complete and authoritative analysis and Arbor the six Under Armour is the most complete and authoritative analysis of Schumann Bob time in the galatea line
 this fog about sand Arbor set of 6 treaties
 Treatise he's treatises also known as the 6th and ours is the most systematically complete exit exegesis
 of the shoebox have never written exegesis commentaries on the box and proceed to the text
verse by verse some work still with parts and special topics at the bottom but nothing of such an encyclopedic scope as the sundarbans anyone there for wanting to know she would become thoroughly would be well served by studying the send armas he goes on to say that while just reading
 in the view of the Gaudi vaishnav us again Gowdy of Gaudi is kind of a geographical term but it means it refers to the followers of future Tanya in the view of the Gaudi vaishnava Schumann Bob temp service two kinds of Readers first those who are already steeped in Devotion to Krishna and we therefore naturally enjoy hearing about his forms qualities and activities
 and second those who are somewhere along the path to such devotion of perfection
 for the accomplished devotees the bottom is full of the Sweet Taste of love of God any quotes of famous worst Niger McCall
Troy Gallatin Pelham
 expert and thoughtful people relish mbabu time the mature fruit of the desire tree The Vedic literature that emanated from the lips of shishuka David goswami there for this fruit has become even more tasteful although it's nectarine juice was already relish before all including liberated Soul continues The Bob & Tom serves those who seek advancement on the second group mention about by gradually attracting them to Krishna and two loving devotional service to him which is described as the original natural behavior the living entity learning to love Krishna requires primarily study of his nature qualities and activities kinds of qualities of the relationships he wants and offers to exchange with us and what abstracts and prevents us from experiencing those relationships
I'll wrap it up with just a little bit more
 My Moment
 maybe that's it. I thought it was something more 12 Rita
 yeah, that's the Marine my comic books
 early entertainment
 okay maybe that's enough for now
 but I think that's a nice you know a nice just a little something to help us understand what we're reading
 I like how you eat and I'll share this part again
 the back of a piranha Howard however is not just a compilation of Life histories it also a lab early presents the theology vaishnava devotion theology however is not this ecology however is not presented in a linear systematic way
please do the medium of prayers offered to Christian other avatars and all and so that's you know that's what we're reading like how we do how how we hear the stories and then the frame the prayers of a great advice I'm over here like in in the chapter that were reading now with about her a lot you know it's kind of like the conversation is framing his state is depth of understanding his knowledge of bhakti his is his realizations through the questions that RBS being asked of him by his father and by his teachers and then we you know if we first when it sits within the context of a story
 but the story is framing these these theological spiritual teachings and so I guess I'll be here more that today
 answer let's do it the right of the Musketeer
go to Mom deivam saraswathi some before we sign that she might buy the time which is every means of Conquest what you got perspective Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan we see the super most human being entombed under saraswathi the goddess of learning
 oh robbery frozen into Chula Vista city of the author
 hopefully we'll get recognized facts that time where he freezes out
 but I will continue to chant the opening still has not stopped for a show about the racial Unity I'll give it back to you tomorrow okay back there bubble tea nice to Key by regular tenants and classes on the bog with Tom and by rendering of service to the pier devotee all that is troublesome to the art is almost completely destroyed and loving service on to the first house you got to do is pray these with Transit out songs is established as in a revocable facts
really, I was born in the darkness of ignorance and my spiritual masters of open my eyes with the torture knowledge I don't have my respect for my respect low bass insist on to them
 okay so I'm feeling hopeful that since it didn't seem like Rugrats lights went out before he Froze that he didn't lose all power but that he just got bumped or froze up so hopefully he'll be back with us very shortly but I'll try to pick up where we left off and I wish I had married here to tell me exactly where we left off yesterday oh I think I think I can find it.
 Re-read text number 12 oh yeah okay well what I do is I just wanted to say I think
wanted to do a little bit of review anyway
 Claude was asked
 where did you get this from you know you were asked by your father what did you learn at school and you started speaking all of this bhakti yoga stuff all this Devotion to Lord Vishnu stuff you're saying that materialistic lifestyle is like a big pit someone falls into and they can't get out of and then you started telling your father that he should leave it all behind and wander off into the forest of and David and worship Lord Krishna our Lord Vishnu where in the world did this stuff come in in his teachers are feeling the pressure because
 cuz provides father such a powerful tyrant
 and he's going to hold his teachers responsible for what his son is learning and so when the when the two teachers got him back in the school they asked where did this all come from where did you hear the stuff have our enemies info
traded in you and someone ends and it said this after this is coming from so that was the second question asked for a lot and a lot again he comes through with this some deep spiritual teachings is getting even deeper now and it ain't really he began to speak on this concept of how people who are actually seeing the truth people that are actually have spiritual realization they don't see in terms of friends and enemies they see a certain Oneness a Oneness that underlies all of the different all the distinctions between us physical distinctions distinctions of race distinctions of sex or gender distinctions of species
 that the one with deeper vision sees past SATs he's the sticky quality on the substratum of that at the spiritual substratum that ends in there for the
I can't see this person is my friend this person is my hand because of that one so I'll just repeat I was going to see if he's here and I'm back sir I'm back home okay let me know so when we when we quickly read what he said already I think that would be versus 11:00 and 12:00 and then I don't think we were at thirteen yet though I hear you're still at Mirage let me offer my respects little bass in season 2 The Supreme personality of godhead whose external energy is created the distinct my friend and my enemy by diluting the intelligence of men indeed I'm now actually experiencing this although I have previously heard it from Thor to sources to be speaking to the school teachers were trying to get to the bottom of how is intelligence became so corrupted
 but when the spring person out of godhead is pleased with a living at 2
because of his devotional service one becomes a pundit and does not make distinctions between enemies friends and himself intelligently he then thinks every one of us isn't Eternal servant of God and therefore we are not different from one another then like stop and then in the he wet wraps it up with this
 are you didn't wrap it there still a couple more
 person to always think in terms of enemy and Friends
 are unable to ascertain the Super Soul within themselves entry Interstate not to speak of them even such exalted persons as Lord Ware ma were fully convert The Vedic literature are sometimes bewildered in following the principles of devotional service the same Supreme personality of godhead who is created this situation
it's certainly given me the intelligence to take the side of your so-called enemy okay let's let's slow down one second here this very interesting purse
 person who always think in terms of as about the let's let's bring this down to like our community right like us people tuning in here and Bobby time ever do want to practice bhakti yoga not like those other people that just listen other times the others who listen to the other people show up every day these are the real people these are the real by become listeners and the others are the enemy of the others could be the enemy David but my point here is that we all like to identify we were speaking about this a bit warmer and some of the previous chapters everywhere
dealing with Richard Sora Indra and all that you know we all like to think that when these texts speak to not speaking about us there speaking about everybody else in this story I'm I'm I'm one of those goodbye but but to the extent that we think this way we will not be going to show a lot of here you said it is long as we're thinking in terms of enemies and friends were unable to ascertain supersede our mama within themselves right people there who think that way
 that is something that we're striving for they were working for that we're spending time and energy and effort
 to try to achieve and it's kind of like if if we're maintaining this kind of sectarian what's what's that there's different camps or whatever you know this kind of political
kind of mentality is kind of like we're rowing the boat but the anchor is down and we're not going in there sometimes when you drive on an drive onto the highway from an exit
 if you could see that the people where the people are eggs that you're going on but then there's another road coming off the exit and that's time we'll have some wrong way wrong way I like don't get on this weekend on the other way always followed that in India by the excuse me bus driver you're on the wrong side of the road with the bus bowl of American students is still really looking bad for us right now I told him you were a professional but the idea is there a trail markers like you are off the trail so the bug of agita and the body of a Time
in this case prologue Mirage is putting down markers to know that you are off base you have gone off the trail you're about to get deeply lost in the woods and you may never find your way back and saw the markers are there like of Appalachian Trailers little marker so you know you're on the trail but then there's a little bit then there's like the wrong way signs you're going the wrong direction so he's putting out 16 chapters expert about this 212 chapter in Bhagavad Gita is great for this to how do you become dear to Krishna how do you know when you're totally off-base what's the mentality of a demonic person what's the mentality of a Godly person and by hearing those it's not like you were saying what wow I think I sound like I'm Godly when I read them I think like oh man I am embracing a bunch of these the my qualities does that even just like I don't just have them I would like rallying behind them
you hear this stuff and he's saying you know I can see you guys are bewildered you're seeing in terms of presidency there for you or not able to ascertain the Super Soul within yourself
 but actually that's where I'm getting it that same Supreme personality got it who is created the situation is certainly given me the intelligence from within to take the side of your so-called enemy so you're wondering how where I'm getting this from is coming from
 now this is a nice first 14 and a nice analogy is used a teacher's as iron attracted by magnetic Stone moves towards the magnet my Consciousness haven't been changed by his will is attracted by Lord Vishnu who carries a disc in his hands thus I have no Independence let's read the commentary to this river is beautiful yeah was chosen
I have it here pulled up we could read it. Read from it he wrote a whole article Once on This analogy of
 the magnet
 I want you going to start okay iron to be attracted by a magnet it is natural similarly for a living entities to be at tracted towards Krishna it is natural and therefore the Lord's real name is Krishna meaning he who attracts everyone and everything by the way some people may think like well I'm trying hard I'm sitting there chanting and I don't get it I'm not that attracted to guess what you are you are attracted to it but we just have bad bad habits and after a while they start as we lose taste for a bad habits and we get a higher taste for attraction to Krishna we look back at her bad habits and think I can't believe I wasn't into that I can't believe that I can't believe I did that what was I
looking right in this is what happens we lose taste for the material world and we developed a taste for Krishna you know I was just hanging out with one of our 3:00 students I took her yoga class and she was teaching down here and yoga and she's just like I told her I was going to be in Alachua for the core premium festival and she said I got to get back to the some Christmas stuff in my wife you know that was so nice being there you do you get to that box you get it like what we're doing it at the Golden Eagle Village and there is just such a high and there's no down time for the Consciousness you're just high and then once you leave that Circle you should have like what just happened to me what just happened to me
 so yeah we are attracted to Krishna we are just overly attracted to Maya
 typical example of such attractions are found in burned oven where everything and everyone is
track it by Krishna.
 The elderly persons like none of our agenda show today be like the friends of the friends like SRI dahm sudam and the other boys that go because like she might be running around me and her Associates even the Birds Beast cows and calves are all attracted to flowers and fruits in the gardens retracted the waves are they you can Muna are attractive and the land the sky the trees to play as the animals and all other living beings are attracted by Krishna this is the natural situation of everything in Randleman
 beautiful
 and then just contrary us to the contrary to the Affairs of her David is being in the material world where no one is attracted by Krishna and everyone is attracted by Maya is it so interesting how my it's just like a
Val isn't it it's almost like yeah when you go to a
 you know Fox Studios or wherever they're for Century wherever they're filming movies and it looks like it's a cowboy scene but there's there's nothing there there's nothing behind it it's fake it's fake like a movie studios in California I never had they look like a New York City street but there's nothing behind it you can't go in the buildings it's all just a prop Maya all you have to do is analyze it thoughtfully although some people just become very very evident this what your world is an illusion it's available it's shiny but it's like broken glass it appears like someone has some value but every time I dive into a grip grip the material that it cuts my hair like grass glass it's not actually has very little value except to teach me lessons
 this is the difference back to the airport is the difference between the spiritual
the world's Ronnie cashew Pooh who was in the material world was attracted by women and money was the big ones where it's allowed Mirage being in his natural position was attracted by Chris and replying to her and you can't refuse question about why prolonged had a deviant view allowed said that his view was not deviant for the natural position of everyone is to be attracted by Krishna Das you poop found this view deviant garage said because of being unnaturally unattracted by Krishna radhika she pooped on this view deviant her Lodge said because of being unnaturally on that unattractive by Krishna Reddy cashew Pooh therefore needed purification and we're going to help with that Lord is your day is going to help with that. The kitchen right now
 as soon as well as purified of material contamination he's again attracted by Krishna
and that's where you know that's the idea behind this this magnet
 analogy an improper takes it further but first let's look at this theology right it's not saying that there's a God who's big and powerful
 and you need to submit to that God
 that's a horrible way to look at God like some like some King is coming to your country's ready to take your cattle your women all your mama pretty is a tire and you got a better surrender to him or he's going to kill you
 give no option you know I've been seeing a few clips of Christopher Hitchens lately in any. He he really works with that stuff like he'll take a a really
 well I think he'll misrepresent although I'm sure he could provide strong arguments he's a famous atheist right yeah and he misrepresented
he's really hear it by the way he's so pompous is just like, I'm and I slept so good
 what actually I don't think it's a good really with religion all he knows always dealing with this bunch of Protestants there in England you know he's not dealing with by shanavas that's part of what I mean so he hid Jose like you know this is your belief that there's this being that's inside your mind and demanding and monitoring your thoughts and and ready to punish you forever for any kind of deviation or behavior that's bad and they don't even to find why it's bad and you know one end and it does you know Christianity has played out like that in many ways it but there's an incredibly beautiful deep spiritual side too but yeah a lot of it is come down in that way and so there's some truth in what he saying but he's not dealing
 with he's dealing with a very small corner you know if we're looking like Earth
he's not dealing with the totality of theology when he's doing now he's not doing so as not to see if you can make the same kind of argument for that and so here we have the idea that God is by nature all attractive
 but he's granted free will to every living me you know and are natural attraction to him if we want it can ease up and end in the example of a of a magnet is there like Iron by my nature is attracted to a magnet but if the iron becomes Rusty it's not attracted you know that that's your you know that snap you know doesn't doesn't work anymore and so the the practice of boxes is all about kind of removing the rust in that purification that was being spoken about so that your natural inclination like like a
you know he's naturally attracted to the one that they object to their love is not submit or go to hell it's like I love you what was I thinking you know it's like right now so there's this article that such a Rodger friend such a ride for road rash spoonfed me bhakti what will this is an article that he wrote called
 of mud and magnets sometimes they say rust or sometimes probably say like a magnet is muddies that attracted her
 but you know any quotes from another friend of ours for juniperus who we've had on the show call Sugar Bowl and this is what he writes on this he writes the Eternal relationship between the pure souls and Bug of on Krishna is considered to be
As Natural as that between iron and a magnet
 as Bucky vinod puts it's a bunch of an old horse is another great teacher in this lineage as part of an old what's it called as iron is attracted by a magnet so the natural attraction of the small Consciousness meaning us toward the great Consciousness meaning God is the symptom of love
 right
 did the natural action you know the natural attraction is a symptom of the love that that is there that's dormant within us that can be awakened and then snap right the attraction is there in his notes on this perspective a note explains that in their quality of Consciousness both God and the living room and the living entities are one Krishna track only the living Consciousness and the mutual attraction of such a consciousness
me of such conscious beings is eternal
 so you were saying people feel unattractive but actually they are eternally but it's just we just got a little muddy a little rusty further the attraction of the smaller Consciousness by the large Consciousness is also eternal
 the smaller Consciousness can pull the he's going to get into that can pull the big one this is reflected in the material world by the attraction of atoms found by physicists
 he goes on with a little bit but this is what such fraud calls out with you says preguntas sources but no tacos. Accounts to and in fact the top scorer wrote about this repeatedly he gives another quote and reads like this just as when a magnet is placed close to iron it displays its inherent natural quality similarly Jiva when endowed with finite Consciousness shows his inherent tendency what is in the proximity of Krishna who's info
Consciousness because of his for Roblox and his inherent nature is pure love so because our hair Nature's pure love
 true love for God when we get close to snap and so how do we get close we read Baba town with chance these days we all the practice is about to see you know it's called to Pasta now you know it doesn't mean just like worship getting close
 now this is what
 this is an interesting follow-up which which goes even more against that grain of that Christopher Hitchens kind of
 what he's commenting on he says but there's more this pure pretty or Prema is pure love attracts Krishna as well so Christmas on all in the attract or by Nature
 but he's also attracted by the love of the Soul or so he says this pure pretty or pray more tracks Christmas while making love of God the ultimate magnet
Force because if God is the all attractive but the all attractive is attracted by one's love
 then love is the ultimate magnetic force even more than God because God has attracted by it so not only is bhagavan like a magnet in other words not only is bhagavan Christian like a magnet attracting all but Prima bhakti devotional love is like a magnet to attracting no less in Bhagavad himself as should have Rupa goswami confirms Christian tracks everyone but devotional service attracts him and in the ward and his words are echoed by Sheila Fish Furniture Pure Barre to talk or particularly in our context he writes praying assumes the nature of a magnet that attracts the black Iron like Shri Krishna making him appear before the devotee
 plus there's a lot of reciprocation bhakti in which fog line attracts the souls the divas and
their devotion he is irresistibly drawn to them as well just as two magnets can attract at least if they're opposite poles are facing each other we should feel that you know when we're healthy when our conscious when we're not allowing our mind to get dragged into the mud
 of the things of this world that attraction you know we feel that attraction strong know there's also no threat by Krishna Krishna just says hey this is how it is you can do it or not I told you everything at Arjuna now you choose what you want to do in this world there's a way when were eager to go towards Krishna Krishna legally run towards us as soon as we say you know what I need a break and guess what everybody you can take a break and a lot of us will take a break from our God our God Pursuit and Kristen will back off and give you that space you need
unfortunately you already have a taste unfortunately you already know too much and you can never enjoy the material world like you did previously like once you knew once you know that it's not New York City it's a facade it's a prop in the mood then when you walk around New York City the fake New York City and do it in LA or in Hollywood you'll be like hot you can't get that same feeling I'm walking in New York I'm just singing in the
 you can't feel like you're in New York anyway it's a pretend it's a romantic a prop what do you call those props
 I said it's a set of Amazon movie Set you know how to get a romance of being in Paris a romance of being in Rome a romance of being a New York City itself set it's not real ones you know that you can't enjoy the material world again you can't get and in people that will do this time it's going to be different
it's not going to be any different it's the same old me worse because you know Tim
 it can never be the same
 Christy gets sweeter actually the more you that ended we've all experienced some sweetness with Krishna already guess what it gets sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
 like that dark Krishna the iron many temples in India that had floating deities many there were more than one there's one I just heard of another one with the front loading deity the famous one was there destroyed by these Invaders in Temple the sun Temple yeah but there was another one a floating deities a whole Interstate engineering fit into that Temple the architectural Master anymore
well now you can dance like this or like yeah it's it is it it it's basically a monument I've been there before
 it's been a long time that's pretty cool it's designed like Surya Dave's chattering amazing it's amazing I got to reclaim them all all the temples get ready and he's going to change Rob mundeer they're going to reclaim the mall I was seeing how they have been destroyed and built on top of them fourteen thousand fourteen hundred hundred
I was thinking about when we were speaking it cuz I I recently saw one big famous group figure popular who figure speaking to a woman journalist who was kind of
 she was kind of coming off real
 I guess you would anyways she was she was asking him about the rum mundeer
 by the way you know who's got a good answer for that to shorty Johnny on her Instagram okay see you at off I'm just about to try to get one right now how much they need both New York Times and what's the big BBC they brought all these pieces on the Indian government right and so did this journalist was kind of going off on this so-called group person but the person is someone who is not
so into but I appreciated his answer any and she was given such a Negative slant and say how divisive it is and it's not but I sent you know we're talking about the cow yesterday and how this Punjab the cow how this works with the cow this this
 this ritual how the Western mind would see it and think oh, how pretty but now it wasn't permanent it's that you know Western People largely we don't even think about directing our own thoughts we just let them be directed and they go in all kind of dark places in Calallen and becomes we can become very cows like that so this Incredible Gift of nature that the Indians love as their mother right they say hold it let's think about this for saying right this cow is giving us milk is providing for us in so many ways and showing us such love and affection it's like our mother let's see it as our mother that's actually like you know that's Advance thinking
so any case with that Ramen deer that the whole thing was these people had a faith based on some very solid in and text you know that go on and on and all different directions with all kinds of consistent depth of philosophy and theology in all different kind of science isn't based on that they had faith in that spot was kind of like a spirit a piece of the spiritual world in the material world and therefore was very special cuz it was the birthplace of law drawn that was a very special spot and when the the Muslim Invaders came in they didn't not only did it did they not respect that
 they very intentionally took that spot desecrated it and then built their mosque on top of it just to shove it down there to try to completely suppress this beautiful they had a temple there that was a place where you go to get uplifting thoughts a place where you go into 2
contact your higher internal nature and let go of your lower nature to give up greed and anger and lust and all these things by meditating on the form of Lord Rama it was a beautiful beautiful thing and and Invaders came and try to vary with Incredible cruelty try to crush it
 it's up to reclaim that spot is not divisive it's just you know it's just
 it's just some writing a wrong that has existed there for many centuries
 totally with you you should hear what the the
 double or nothing I saw you pronounce his name he was a Muslim King to what he actually wrote about the how they're going to crush his Spirit of the Hindus and then go to the Hindus demolish the Krishna janma that that's what I that's what I go in for next
I take back the whole Krishna janmastami
 Jai sriram holy places 11 was Krishna and when was Shiva they went to all these places and they get hundreds of other places and it was really it it was really not because we wanted to worship Our God it was what we wanted to crush the spirit they could have built a mosque anywhere anyway anywhere but so now they're just saying it and then some some people are saying oh you know these aren't even there actually old mosques but so they're saying okay we're going to go and see if they are and what they're just finding Sanskrit writing your fine. He's buried or in the basement they had to drain it with the one they're doing that right now in and gets any magnet he's sitting right next to the one in Varanasi and they they drain the water
pictures of water in the basement and there they found the deed of Sheba and they just going to reclaim all these temples now and you know who could do this for 500 years be that tolerant any other cultures or say okay we had Invaders come in we're taking back what's ours Indian it was in the courts for years like a century or something like that
 all right now that we got that off our chest
 how to play I hate you at least tell us how do you apply sure about how to hate traitors not enemies it was like it it's just like allow these these wonderful people to have their beautiful area of deep meditation for peace you know that's what that's what they established it so that we can see the Super Soul in the heart of every living any allow them to have that spot back if you know it's Hindus do not convert
the sword yeah they convert by culture u c o i want to learn it or not even fix my camera ready you're not even into converted that's not their thing why don't I think it's not what they say that because we breach but the idea is that but we're okay hobo happy. Their own religious right information this is great I'm going to apply to Judaism I'm going to try it to Christian exactly yeah that's the feeling me type Hindus it's they're going to share prashad and glove Germans with you and Indian music and or bhajans there's not an enemy we don't feel like they're enemies or even competition we brace people wanted to practice run spiritual faith
 yeah and it did they rebuild your mosque but why did he have to tear down our temple on the spot on the spot of load ROMs birthplace that's where we went to uplift our minds and our hearts and you desecrated the whole thing took it over.
huge mosque on and try to crush our our faith in our practice
 Yeah and the fact is in here is incredibly tolerant of other religions there and they're not going to boycott a Christmas celebration was great in Jesus how nice will do two will do it tell ya we worship Jesus was your Christmas party
