 take a deep breath. Okay
 so everything's good here I was going for another for today
 once you understand that who's this from this is from no one in there for I'm taking credit I said this once while wandering down a winding path do you know I don't think I Google this soap 7 Google so we may find out work
 I like it once you understand the power of your words you won't just say anything once you understand the power of your thoughts
you won't just think anything once you understand the power of your presence I'm taking full credit for this weather once you understand the power of your presence you won't just be anything anywhere anywhere anywhere anywhere anywhere that is wonderful
 that is wonderful right yeah
 yeah thought your things words are things you know that's a great book is
 that book
 I forgot
 what do you start kaszuba
play just went down well you know let's take a look at this is talking about control control of your words and control of your thoughts by presents you know really all this has to do with thoughts right yoga sutras really but I think my presence we could understand like we're we're we're placing our attention right that's where we're at. So let's start with begin once you understand the power of your words you won't just say anything nothing affects your own mind like the words coming out of your own mouth you know what to speak of the fact that they have on other people in the fact they have on other people's minds but this is what you know probably would say
 you don't Moana Beretta this vow of silence is something that's there in the yoga culture goes way back we're going to read about I don't know if we're going to get there actually maybe it'll be tomorrow or some like that but we hear about this python person very interesting person yeah very interesting yoga Pro
very interesting of a practice where they apparently the python doesn't move around much it just Waits it just lies and one place in the food comes to it and then I did nothing like hot yoga primary series to Stone Ian garbi crime this is a whole different type of yoga practice I don't need ever for anything you let it come to you if it's up to you you accept it if it doesn't come to you you're so I'm fine with that then I guess yeah I'll text you at that face so so there's so many different interesting practices and one of them is an amount of breakfast is to take a vow of silence people go on these some deposit or treats with her silent Ali Brownstone it I know that and in your silent for 10 days and days of romantic silence kind of life partner at Lincoln Street I hope they don't go there I hope
on a silent 10-day Meditation Retreat you know there's there's always room for romance I know what they say in a tupperware that really happens in the Harry Krishna Temple it's when you know they passed you know where I'm talking about okay so they are not for the public it's it's like there's Mangal aarti going on there passing the gay lamp around all the men pass around and then the one guy passes it to the one woman and connection
 you know maybe for you it was that way you know I would never be the guy to pass I was like I'm too scared of that position within how do you know cuz I would watch and look over my shoulder and I saw the love connection happening okay so but he gave you the look
we generally don't practice at Mount of Route 2 but probably say Automotive rata is just not speaking about unimportant things I probably say that silence that's actually what I want that's that's how proper would find that it's not silence to let like we had the other day when we put me on the hot seat what was that about that one it says that's not qualities sometimes you read in the pain a shot of somebody that is saying God is the absolute is near Guna has no quality brother say when we were here that we understand that that means it is no material qualities and stimuli our vow of silence music it doesn't mean we don't say anything but it means that we don't engage ourselves and Monday and talk we are words are valuable will find it what we speak
 changes it infects our mind affects the minds of other people so wise person
 is saying this has power once we understand the power of the words you want
just say anything right if it is a chick Leaf ourselves how we speak what we speak will you become really care for that we we we say we offer our body or words are mind interested in each one is more subtle than the Nexus one thing to control the body it's another thing you don't control you say offer the body and then offer the words still more in and it's all important because ultimately have to offer the mind and that's where the next thing comes up out of the thoughts I have this realization before I was even a devotee because sometimes we indulge in materialistic thoughts actions transactions relationships and we get disgusted with them and then we we like I can't do this anymore so I remember I was just like I was like a really sarcastic teenager sarcastic Road cutting and I got so sick of it that I said you know what I'm not going to I'm not going to speak anymore I'm sick of hearing myself her people's feelings and
fun at someone else's expense little moment of self discuss a little bit of discussing I can't stand what I'm doing anymore I get home or that's if that's a breakthrough it was a breakthrough and I stopped talking and it only lasted a I hate to say it but I just couldn't do it but I can do I think I can do here's here's the point I want to go with this it's not just that we have to stop our talking
 you can do the appropriate thing you can use your words in creating the service by being very very careful about what you consume with your words consumed with your ears what we've consumed with our ears will eventually flow out of her mouth so if you're putting a lot of junk media junk news you junk junk music
mrbeast that's why we're talking about this but anyway to make a long story short whatever we put in that's going to flow out so if you want Krishna qatada flow out if you want or I can try to flow out on a regular basis put the good in in the good will come out you put the Monday in in in the Monday and I'll come out no matter what you put in that will end up coming out of you okay so we just have to be careful what we're feeding the ears and you know when it comes to death so important organize it is a little Part B that is it is if Mona Beretta meaning you're not talking but you're putting nonsense in the mind that's no good either because what's happening is now you're creating a garage you know the storage container with in the mind of the mundane and it's not coming out of the mouth it's just fermenting up there thinking about it we want to still mind that's where we're going but this still night still mine for focused
Saudia it all goes to the thoughts once you understand the power of your thoughts what are the power of your thoughts this is where once you understand the power of your thoughts you won't just think anything was yum yum Bobby Shmurda on Bob on what we think about the term is our next body are next to the Future circumstance even in this life it does but what did speak of the power that it has taped it to move us around the universe or to move us even with out of the universe it all has to do with we think therefore what is it does not serve a shoe cobbler shoe Mom on who's smarter you to show Kristen tells Arjuna you know what do you think about the term is your next your next body your next birthday there for always think of me
 and at the same time fight bright in in our endeavors in this world
 connect it all to your relationship we got feel God in your heart we are walking with God at every at all moments realize that and your mind won't become degraded your thigh
don't become too great and you will Elevate yourself you could you can travel all over the universe and Beyond by the power of your thoughts
 and I remember the book I was thinking about nonviolent communication you read that mirror
 yeah it's really good Marshall Rosenberg I think I feel like that's right something like that I like that I think it would be good for you I can help you
 I can help you guys working at the one you say you think it will be good for me I feel like you're condescending
 yes yes you do understand you said you can help me I feel like you're trying to put your position as the guru to me when you say
communicating on rocking off when you say slow the heck down feel like strangling you off camera but this one I took a little more esoteric once you understand the power of your presence you won't just be anywhere where is the Krishna box at anytime anywhere
 Denver nobbin there there there there in Christmas you know I was a little little less esoteric than that but when we spoke about to be pretty and myself in a couple other friends went to visit so you know you got to take the train
 from Penn Station and we came back you know now it's like 8 p.m. at night when we arrive back at the
 at Penn Station from Jersey and
I love you pretty and I both had some round still the champ had some job at a champ and I thought okay I'll just walk home and and Chad was late you know you might as well. That not the highest quality job but yeah but you a nice walk so you know you get out 1/8 Avenue you woke so you know I live just off of Central Park West which is you know the equivalent of having it so I just straight line
 and what if they hate the Avenue through Hell's Kitchen this is all New York is still alive and kicking it and so both her and I were walking straight to just Insanity hell hell yeah I mean just like suffering Insanity craziness bizarreness absurd and yeah and on a beautiful evening but like just walking right through it all and chanting japa and you know you I don't recommend that that's how we deal with Jen or drop it was the circle
as I was saying you know
 so I had to do it but when you want to
 you can be anywhere even when you're in hell you can be in the spiritual World in just chatting that name had me you know in the Holy Dom it does like walking through Bizarro world and we went we went on a country road yesterday last night about the same time you did we run a country road walk Barnes Farms Fields Rolling Hills and you
 am I in my mind and total Maya you and I had the great Fortune there when we were young men and we got into bhakti there were people in our lives that said we need to take you to bring David we need to take you to my poor you need to experience
it will change your life and it really has work that way this this is a really important part of the practice of Buc-ee's is this pilgrimage aspect up at 2 to visit these holy places and get a feel for what it's like
 when the world is revolving around God and not around a billion little individual people trying to make the world revolve around them it's it's it's some it can it can affect your mind and your heart of took away and you can carry that experience with you
 when you leave so that wherever you go you feel that present you feel your presence of her. I'm so once you understand the power of your presents now they have prop hunt you know he was in it was in the Lower East Side of New York City says you think I'm sitting on the Lower East Side I'm sitting at my job it's more real that when the mind is absorbed in that spiritual energy
you actually there in a more real sense then you are like in the physical sense you know that when we store on wherever I'm at where are you think about ten thousand things right now I'm there about two or three times for sure we're going to him looking at you wondering if I got a lot going on up here but maybe you're having yeah I say that to my son cuz my son catches me just like looking at this pace and he's like what are you looking at I was just garlanding Krishna Krishna in the spiritual realm Rocco on my last visit to India
 which is the second longest
stretch I've ever spent there and you know it's bathe in the bad news is like 5 years I was bathed in the ganga every day and I kind of caught on I think more than ever did before the idea that I just said not that I I didn't have experience of that of feeling the pressure by the grace of my time in the Holy Place feeling that when I'm not there but I was what was different was I was so turned into it that while I was there I was saying this right here is what I'm going to carry with me you know like in the moment I was let you know I would I would I would go into the ganga in my pour into the Ganges River
 and chant but I would chant like like three or four rounds of Joppa in the ganga you know yeah and Anna's I did it I just knew like just filled the purifying power of this River and just chant the name like
like it's a flowing river of krishna's Grace
 and then feel this when you're back in New York you don't feel this wherever you are in the world like feel like that when you Chan you're in that Holy river that purifying holy River when you're chatting and and I think it even kind of reinforced it you know like because I was already focusing on that while I was there I wasn't just recalling it but it's kind of setting up the whole recall you know
 but yeah we driving separate the chance shop in a river is it inappropriate is it appropriate or inappropriate to change shop in a river I saw that inappropriate to change up anywhere holy name Tyler purifying
 probably pure just checking in kind of when you say is it inappropriate the chant job
I feel like you're you're grasping for any kind of straw to criticize me
 I don't need a thing today that's all I'm asking from you I'm asking you to think a little bit and deeply may be more deeply than usual people I can help you okay. Which is a very mean to Conquest when should I expect labason sees this supreme Lord Narayan on 290 right now in the rain reach you the super most human being until others are swapped to the goddess of learning and she'll be off today the author not stop radiation of operation H&M back about a buy a bag of it to you too much locate back to your brother tonight sticky my regular tennis class in the bag of Tom and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise a transcendental songs we established as a revocable fact
home again at the Midland Michigan and Genesee. I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes I offer obeisance to their Lotus feet reading finished my biking time can do 7 chapter 13 text 55 we were hearing of not only about the regulations the rules that the senior see the renunciate follows The Wanderer wandering The Drifter that you have to but also about his realizations in and how he's transforming he's we were hearing that he's out in the Rama he's but you got to just be fully satisfied internally right I don't need anything extra for the happiness you have to develop the sentiments
 sarva bhuteshu secret being the while Wishing Well we serve every living being out there what was your friend
 Shanta
play peaceful the Ryan a pariah
 always depended on always connected to always feeling that you're taking the shelter of of Lord Narayan of Lord Vishnu and then and then through this practice
 seeing God everywhere seeing how Christian is providing everything every layer of the strata of existence that were moving through
 alright text 5 during unconsciousness and Consciousness in between the two you should try to understand the self and be fully situated in the south in this way he should realize that the condition conditional and liberated stages of Life are only illusory interesting and not actually factual was such a higher understanding he should see only the absolute truth pervading everything mean the liberated states are
illusory I think so about like there's a well let's see say unconscious and in this conscious and there's an end to National two in the liberated one step at a time
 you have the unconscious which is a deep sleep you have the Consciousness which is awake awake and stay and then you have the dream stay which is in between
 right and that's not the question I was asking what I know
 so it's saying whether you're deeply being affected by the time iguana in deep sleep you know or whatever state that you're in the mine should be agitated right there should there should be
 you should be seeing something deeper in any of those States in realizing that then he says okay then you realize that the conditional state that means where I
buying into this as
 the program state which we would call like the materialist or deliberate estate which we would call like the person that's aiming for Moksha which is still not the right upper I know right it's still not the full truth hasn't been revealed in that stage you've realized what you're not
 but you haven't realize what you are
 are they you haven't fully realize what you are you know you may realize I'm Spirit but you haven't realized I'm krishnadasi bye bye you know by my very nature I am
 connected to the that Eternal personal Source in a particular way and so if I'm thinking I am that Divine energy I am the one Divine Light
still an illusion
 with such a higher understanding he should see only the absolute truth pervading everything XX since the material body is sure to be vanquished it's hard to believe that the body I know it's cuz Steve is going to be bank with soon so it's getting back we should every moment yeah yeah
 and the duration of one's life is not fixed and he's any moment
 neither death nor life is to be raised rather want you to observe the Eternal time factor in which the living entity manifest himself and disappears you know what I want to do I want to do a interview day where I interviewed some somebody on your death experiences and bees
 okay yeah maybe bring on let's jump
I can't think right now I'm cool cool pretty what does she have to do with that
 okay I had to cuz I didn't have chaplains deal with people have these debts and they come back to life and they have some vision of the afterlife in the tunnel I'm not sure if that's what
 constitutes his daily experience part to know know but probably when you're dealing with people dying all the time I don't know if he might have collection that guy why did why is he not that guy
 I see you know he may just be helping people
 psychologically deal with what they're going through it if you don't think he sees people dying
 I'm not I don't know if he's a hospital chaplain
 not really what is it I'm not sure I forget I'm at home while he is definitely like a hospital chapel
person okay we got to get one of these guys on but just that the team will be explicitly near-death experience what they say but near death experience is hot. Now they got stories he's got a Snorlax you don't why don't you go and get one of those experts at like that they interview on these well just I just did with the name Sebastian Junger and filmmaker and he is not a spiritual guy he is not his I think he's an atheist and he just said yeah he probably younger than me and he had an aneurysm and practically died it was a great interview and it was first and he said
 he had this his father came to his dead father came to him and it was just like incredibly shocking and it was a full-blown nde and it was great about it was
Joey do this whole thing of looking at a dead body that is not the person I know and who what is spirit what is consciousness and how it just you could just here I'm getting driven to every question you ask as a new devotee you know all those really important questions it brings up some people do have these experiences that you cannot explain
 it sure makes us dig a little deeper into this transition between this body and the next World what is the next World Valley of sharing on the chat that some of the speakers on the bike run the Institute summer school have done research in Indy e near-death experiences give me some names would be able to give me some names going to find them but let's get into this verse regular rather than you know when you say let's get into this verse I hear
okay you're understanding all this world back in a slingshot where you pull it back the more Springs forward that is used when you jump into the new verse when I just said let's get into this one I feel like you're not listening to me it's not a dialogue when you say I'm not listening to you I hear you think you own this podcast I thought you're going to hear when you say I feel like you're not listening to me I hear blah blah blah blah
Vortex sex that I want to discuss the text and yet maybe read the purport to you no talk to me talk to me I sent them to your body is sure to be vanquished okay that's a fact and the duration of of one's life is not fixed neither death nor life should be praised what do you think that means should be pretty neither death nor life shall be praised like there should not be an overly attachment to either one right now we have an attachment to life it's like we're fighting for life and then of course then we get sassy with it like I've got to take my longevity herbs Etc but in death is feared we were fearful of that God knows what's going to happen I'm going to lose everything I have it should be an understanding that there is no life or death there is just any turn Outlet T of the spirit when I heard
 the phrase
that is the neither that neither life nor death should be praised my mind went back to bug of agita before
 yes I do
 but if I don't know it by number but don't start me off on it I've read all the verses of it that's for Krishna Arjuna
 turn some turn some Christian cuz Christian has been describing the State of Consciousness it's beyond was taught in the original Vedas and it's more like through punish out of Consciousness right where you kind of let go of the desire for the things of this world he said he's actually saying literally you need to transcend the teachings of The Vedas flowery words to The Vedas you need to not be caught up in thoughts of opulence and material enjoyment that that the wielders you
and you need to
 enter into like a fixed State of Consciousness right that that's based on your in your intelligence your your buddy that you kind of filter your decision making in your thought process through this rational filter within the broader mind and then you and then you become this Sage that's fixed that has a work that's moving to the world was fixed intelligence and Arjuna turns to Christian at that point and he asks him when we pull it up with her or something I'm doing a right to 54
 2
 54 search
 oh yeah the internet age
 State the projects I got new that Mike what are the symptoms of those whose Consciousness is that emerge and Transcendence that says he's a big guy
and what is his language how does he sit and has a walk so we understand how does he walk
 how does he has it is wagger so yeah we understand by seeing the answers that follow this finished and that he was speaking figuratively and that he was he eating these are the three terms used in that he said State the pregnancy one whose intelligence is you could say one who has fixed intelligence or one of those whose intelligence comes fixed in wisdom
 Samari Samari Stasia 106 in trance writer whose whose mind isn't going here in there Steve 2D fix the meditation how do they propose cheetah how does he speak
 and that means he has three things how does he how does he speak how does he sit how does he walk
 so the first one can provide shade
what what is asking is how does he respond to the external circumstances how does he speak how does he respond
 chemistry to how does he sit
 there's a there's a word connection there for you write a Sita set
 House Of Consciousness what is consciousness like when it senses are disengaged from the objects how does he sit a jtech him how does he walk what's his Consciousness like when the senses are engaged in this world are engaged with the objects you know he's busy in the world but this one came from Bosch 82 how does he speak the answer to that is text to 57
 hey Hugo
 go to the next one okay
 the scream purse
 next one next one again 257
50 Cent okay I'm on my phone I can't go that fast your world by whatever good or evil he may be obtained neither praising it nor despising it is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge that's how they speak when we hear good or evil I think we could just say this is kind of like that question we heard it's a good or bad karma we could change it to say whatever Pleasant things are unpleasant things they might be they might encounter in life right in the material world war affected by whatever Pleasant things are unpleasant things come their way here is the key neither praising it nor despising it right there neither there neither saying you we could say another praising it or criticizing it that they're they're firmly fixed in perfect knowledge when you meet someone that's really deeply spiritually realizing fixed in that practice a real Yogi
a real spiritualist
 they're not all excited about the things that common people are excited about they're not and it all you got to do is scroll your little thing around and you're going to find people that are very excited that this is great this is great this is terrible this is terrible and they're all caught up in what's coming out of their mouth
 you know is just there their excitement about this external circumstance which is about to change because it is about to change because that's the nature of the material world and so when we come back to this verse reminded me of that that what we're reading today since the material body is sure to be vanquished in the duration of life is one in once duration of life is not fixed
 neither death nor life should be praised right I'm not I'm not going on too much about it I'm kind of I'm kind of them present in the moment
 right I'm not being shaken caught up in
let's put it that way right caught up in getting my this precious Consciousness this presents all of it is there in two days. It right where's my presence at where am I at right now I'm all caught up in the latest political that I'm all caught up in the latest dumb bad or Trend I'm all caught up in the celebrity I'm all caught up in getting angry about this social issue or that the thing that you know I'm all caught up in it
 and that's where my that's where my where my words are not how does he speak
 he doesn't pray that he doesn't despise there's a certain even this you know of in in the yogi that allows them to see deeper
 that's what I want to share and what are they observed and what is it allowed them to observe
 allows them to observe the Eternal time Factor
 right. If it allows me to sit here and say we are sitting in a world that's moved by the powerful force of time
and I'm watching it happen other people have caught up as if this is a certain reality I'm seeing the time factor is basically transforming the whole thing into a dream that it's here one moment and it's called an accident by observing that it helps me understand who I am because I'm the reserve on Beyond at all I'm of a different nature and eternal this is Ava magana now this is what the crc's thinking right now I'm behind it on this is their end of their life they've already if someone could come and see what about being responsible or they've done that their whole life right they've done that their whole life in this is the time for the Deep you noticed that the very end of life were there they turned over all the responsibilities to the kids and so on they shared with the world what they need to share
 and they're really trying to not just theoretically understand the nature of the self but it in a deeply realized way they want to feel it they want to know it
do you want me to come to
 a sex or insects survive
 sex
 76 you
 living entities in this mature world not only at the present but also in the past have been involved in trying to solve the problem of birth and death
 some stress death and point to the illusory existence of everything material
 whereas other stress life trying to preserve it perpetually and enjoy it to the best of their ability that was Jana and Kearney some stress death death in this world is an illusion yeah it's going to be better
 now and then some stress no no you got to live here
you got to be the healthiest you can you got to be we're going to become sent Aryans were going to take these Himalayan herbs he's alluding to the Taughannock point of view
 write the whole world is illusory yeah yeah and so it's all going to die you know so don't identify with that which is going to die and then others stress life this is the karmic they're trying to preserve and enjoy through
 through a Dharma to enjoy this world
 when you say
 they're as good as the nonviolent communication it
because people so crazy to get more violent it just becomes it just becomes a game it's more aggressive more seething when you said both of them or both of them are fools and Rascals it is advised that one observe each the Eternal time factor which is the cause of at your body's appearance and disappearance and that one observe the living entities entanglement in this time Factor shoebox with no talk were there for sings in his song the tea-table Ali walay Teddy body na dekhile bi translation for that please forgive my Sanskrit or my Bengali there
 munchie singer with the melody you probably get it if you do that
Nadia Karim a parley party Baba
 okay try it again with a different Melody come on just when you say try to give it a different Melody I hear the translations my Lord I do not know when I commenced my material life I don't know when it began I don't know when I'd landed in this virtual reality
 but I can certainly experience that I've fallen in the deep ocean of Nations now I can also see that there's no other way to get out of his the take shelter of your Lotus feet
 beautiful what you deserve the activities of the of Eternal time is a good one one should observe us to Becerra tivities of Eternal time
which is the cause of birth and death before the creation of the present Millennium the living entities were under the influence of the time factor and within the time Factor the material world comes into existence and again annihilated budva bhutva lesson on manifest
 being under the control of the time back to the living entities a and die Life After Life
 this time factor is the impersonal representation of the Supreme personality. Head who gives the living entities conditioned by material nature a chance to emerge from this Nature by surrendering to him you know what I'm going to put out there right now if anybody listening has had an ND and near-death experiences out of body experience and I'm going to write it in Tamara was going to say just want to wait at gmail.com and I'm going to collect it and bring
I have a whole show on it okay you had a near-death experience or an out-of-body experience please write nde in the subject line rakkanoth in the Iraq and a half and I'll take that file and we'll have a special showing it when you see about that it's too I think we should bring Theresa Caputo on that show is what I got news for you every time I hear from you I didn't compare you with her. I think that would be a good shot because it could be our biggest show bigger than anything you've done so far any case Okay so so we hear again that that here at the end probably said that this time factor is the impersonal representation of the Supreme person I forgot and so here's a formula right when we're caught up praising or criticizing our circumstances
we tend to lose our ability to be an observer and watch God work through this world as a Time Factor now we're out of touch now we lost we lost our our footing or we lost our grounding you know we're not Angry Anymore in reality we were floating in the waves drowning in the waves of that ocean of ignorance so if if we're that that's that's the discipline right let me not get caught all this is such a beautiful day we're going to draw like crazy we're going to have fun we're going to do that oh my God it's so hard not to praising it another criticizing it it gives me the clarity to see God working working as a Time Factor working on other ways to
 like that stick in a Time factor a Time Factor its time its time for Miss Mary's takeaways announcement to make I should have made in the reason I'm going to Burlington Vermont be Miss Mary
