 live from Sri dahm Maya for this is wisdom to say to the Daily 202 podcast with your hoes drunk enough since he heard about the Centre New York cuz stupid I was watching the show everybody Welcome to My Poor Tom the birth place of Lord say time you were here live live with the group of students here say hello everybody
 we're on the roof of the Beautiful by snob Academy
 and we have just begun just begun to live with just be cancelled today yeah I'm excited
back in my poor we had a great weekend sorry we couldn't do the show we are just like a little overwhelmed coming off of the training and every other weekend it was the flower festival very very wonderful time yeah I really was any highlights 12 recap on up over the flower festival we call that whole weekend or whatever the flower festival itself I mean that was really the highlights
 it I think some of us Veterans of it cuz you and I probably don't like over 15 x yeah I don't know I think I might throw a few flowers in that kind of tsunami sinkhole very nice talk and then when the music Started done yet
 Siri
beautiful Melody that she sang and I was and then you know you were sitting there watching the try to go pee not being bathed in the flowers are the beautiful Melody and I was little like holding back the tears a little bit like you know she was really nice and then at a certain point you know the flowers start falling from the sky and I don't know before then the hours for the deities and it's like beautiful up here bunch of white flowers on Sunday at the red flowers or the white one and then it goes down again and they do another color there was like what
 it's it's weird how that and then at a trick or something is somebody's excitement and then like saw these huge mounds of fluffy flowers are like cascading down now and then it's certain point the priests they're on their knees in the floor and they start to throw them up in the air just on the altar
SI fireworks scene people break into t r h is it's like it's all his it's made up of sunlight it's just like sunlight and my Earthly beauty of the flower in the scent of a flower and softness of a flower in the in the world or the such a delicate natural phenomenon that so in touch with your feminine side I was sitting with rhinos will be picking those pedals and he started glorified without that was the highlight for me that you offer them to Rod Heidi gave us a month so I won't tell you the money through a secret and will the Munch Munch of Errata gave us the Mantra and they put into his heart and offered it and then he put the flowers
flowers you know we literally tons of flower petals that that are cascade over Radha gopinath but yeah and so no I think it's over two tons or maybe you want to have time to forget any case he holds a fire to his chest says a prayer is like these really into this and then you called us to sit in a cat like first he called me over when I don't know what do you want to talk to me about something it was just like just sit and I was done plucking I was tired of him sit on the ground for a long time but when he said he you just sending you to sit down start to Pluckers like okay I'll stay here as long as you want because I could see he was in a he was in a in a mood like in a very devotional mood and he was inviting me to be with him while he was and then he and then then then called you over and
he explained he said and I was saying I'm not going to do this put it to my heart that I'm not going to like this is how you do it then he gave us he said you say you for your prayer Dorada you hold it then with this monster then you throw the petals into the basket and so I just started doing it and you know who I spent probably at least another hour they're just doing that and nothing was said here sit next to me it's always like sort of like how I got to go he wants me to be with him I'm like great fortunate to be here but I like but I have to serve these other people on your behalf I'm serving them but I was like well I got to go because I think they can wait I think they can wait I like okay I know but I don't think they even the other way around here
been to as a devotee
 this is the meeting I've been waiting for this is coming here and picking flowers this is the most important meeting stupid I'm sitting here in my garage and flowers when they were so many people who is brand new to you can just see the excitement in the joy and for us have done it so many times it was the same thing for us to do this anyway it was wonderful so we could go on and on about the weekend but it I think I woke up early we have day off yesterday and we just chilled and hung out together because if we don't get sick of each other talking laughing hugging each other in the pool laughing more. Okay
 splashing
or that we have to do that

 who's first in his mother Chelsea
 welcome thank you thank you when was the first time you came to mind
 2007
so so tell see you're not from Lebanon you're from Toronto what's your story how do you find your own sorry and how did you get how did you get into boxy
 it's a long story but for sure it's I came with a friend honestly I didn't like it in the beginning it all it was very foreign to me but because I kept coming with a friend I respected his opinion slowly the care that the body's just won me over just they can be so sweet and then I felt like a soul but I'm not a person who is special to me it's a long story but it took some time to win me over but if that's the short story it's a beautiful part of that story is that is such a big part of our culture is that bike never care another care to give other devotees it does something to the heart it's almost like we've been like we've been beaten dogs and we're scared
we're scared to trust was scared to love was scared to invest in an emotional relationship and then if you've seen a beating dog they're scared they'll bite they don't want to make and how do you change those dogs you love them if you really love them they just their heart opens and is is do the devotees love you turned around I love that story I think a lot of us feel the same way about that too
 so I'm traveling here with your family
 it is a different then when you're traveling alone yeah yeah it's a different type of service to yourself you really have to do things to let go of your own expectations and keep in mind we're always here to serve and having a family reminds you of that it can be frustrating but the same time as you set up the right mood it can be very very special because you really have to be selfless
okay I guess how her husband met is you're going to love this one how yeah I do hear this
 they were there in a bison around the way together and one of them was Krishna and one was rude and mean and you can guess who's everybody know who I'm meeting Renee are the rest is history
 okay questions do you have a question today I do have a question so why here in shimaya part which is the birthplace of the Avatar Shri Krishna and he is known as Avatar who is the most merciful most compassionate and what it is he he shared the whole name the chanting with everybody and not only that but he didn't give any considerations that didn't matter who you were where you're from what your background was if you're one of the elite or if you're one of the dented cans or anywhere in between he
everyone to have the opportunity to try and yet at the same time a lot of the Past Times a lot of his teachings especially some of the conversations he had with with other stage names are Stanley people they can be very deep and very esoteric and for someone who might be new to vokti it can be very difficult to understand some of those Concepts and some of those ideas so how can we understand this apparent dichotomy we're in one hand and he's really opening up for everyone at the same time what is what he is offering almost seems so unattainable or they're so difficult to comprehend or very good question thank you thank you
 when I take a simple stab at this tune you can elucidate on it a math professor
 has the ability
 to teach calculus to trigonometry all advanced math but sometimes for the bed
set of the that little child they want to teach them how to add how to do addition to the say there's one apple here's three apples how many apples do I have now for our so so within the teachings of lordship Tanya it's important to hear them with an appropriate teacher if you were to stumble upon a old Bengali library and you studied Bengali and you were to translate these you would get it's most likely you would get lost in it and I think that's completely understandable because if it's best if it's taken out of context and you just try to as an academic try to understand it the wedding cultures taught all these are all taught in a contacts almost like if I was to take a carburetor out and throw it in a in a classroom with kids and ask okay kids what do you think this is I don't know what it is or if you take a cassette
play cassettes in our car now if you if I throw up the set on the table my living room a kids going to want to kiss that is it is there are antiques so they're out of context
 the date on a charge Rita is part of a bigger Vedic contacts but it's also meant to be explained by senior bhakti practitioners in the senior Baka practitioner will give you like a child certain amounts of the information they'll give you first grade information third grade information 7th grade information according to what you can hear the chords like what a child can register if you are really new to just be allergic to honey I brought chanting and made chanting very public and that's the most General way I would explain it to a person and I think even when my life my teachers are waiting to fill me and more and more and more on teacher on the teachings of or take Tony cuz it. That well goes very very deep
 we think I agree
I was thinking you know it's funny that we somehow got to it wasn't the same question but it led to the same answer I think it was even just the last to know that we did you know this who is shuchi Tanya
 this is its you know he's kind of like a
 like a somewhat of a secret Avatar like he's not mentioned where some of the other avatars mentioned but hit the dimensions of them are there in the show the predictions that he would come
 how special he is but you have to look for them when you look for them they're very clear but it says the Christian comes in three different yugos in three different avatars but doesn't mention the color you go but then but then there's this kind of like esoteric secret information with a but actually it does come
 and what is sharing what what is what is trying to experience they say there's an internal
purpose for his coming and then this is the external part beside the internal purposes like the most esoteric aspect of our philosophy that Christian realizes that the whole love in your heart for another's and more moving a powerful experience than to be loved by someone and so he's seen Rod of holding love for him and her how hard she loves God
 and she realized he realizes that the feeling of loving God in your heart is more powerful than than being God feeling someone feeling that love towards you so he's like what is it like to feel with rata feels the love that she has for me the mysteries of that the deepest the deepest love that exists what it what is it like to feel that so then you cut the internal reasons coming to shoot you Tanya is now he comes as a devotee of Krishna and he can dive into the
pastimes abroad and Krishna in the Bog with Tom poetry by great poets like jagave goswami and Spilled among the top Elkhorn others and put on sad songs take part in Rochester Festival which is all about the the emotions that writer has her Christian so many different ways he was experiencing the deepest love for Krishna the most intimate so
 as as you're saying the the esoteric level of what his experiences is now maxed out right and which means that the depth of the love is maxed out right he's experienced in the deepest love there is and so this is the thing that
 when love is directed towards the one that we love we call it love and it become a different varieties like we can say this parental love that the parent asks their child is the loved that a friend has her another friend is romantic love and
cheap Christmas Feeling. Shoot your tongue is peeling Rod is love which is the deepest romantic love and the object that love is God so it's the deepest most esoteric beautiful in the depth of it is impossible but when the When Love
 towards God when the same that same love that the volume has in the heart when it's pointing towards God when they take that same heart and they pointed towards the rest of the world
 it manifests as compassion Same Love in This direction is like Prima and in this direction it's compassion and so the more that it goes in this direction towards what were thinking okay that's very esoteric very few people will be given to but the more that he's going in that direction the more that he wants to be compassionate so he's feeling incredibly deep love and then he's like saying anyone can take it either has no prices no
please take it I'm begging you take on down on the ground begging you just a chance his name and experience what I'm experiencing so somehow the more that it goes towards Prima the more that it goes towards compassion in when he's in that mood this is just so unique very beautiful mood of Christian I said them with Christians and Randolph and that's Krishna that his mood is called midoriya just very sweet that dude is just a very sweet Beauty in his love
 but when he's in my poor or we are now when he is taking the form of should Tanya then his mood is have diarrhea it's it's compassion is Mercy and so the deeper the Prima goes the deeper the mercy goes to the point where anyone even the greatest Scoundrels right than the straight up criminals like jot jug and mud I thought he's he's begging them know he's giving it to that
you know I'd let you know that is extending that that that compassion still further you know let's give it to everyone somehow so somehow those two with such a powerful lesson again in the in this age where you know you want to hate somebody when you irritated that you're really encouraged to have enemies and boogie man that you hate and sometimes by me hating somebody could tell you if you can tell my audience who the type of person I am. He hates this person in America it's like I hate Trump or I hate biting or whatever it is it's you your showings for the part of your persona and what you hate and there's just no room with in this philosophy to do that it is that if you hate someone if someone's acting real demonic you give them some you give them to you beg them to take the Holy Name you have 100% faith that people can change not that they are what's the word condemn
none of us are condemned and if we don't believe in that idea of that there is actually no condemnation it's important or else we can very easily be condemned for everything we done wrong and I'm sure we have a rap sheet you know if you don't think you have a rap sheet in this life you most likely have one in your last life you know we have a rap sheet ourselves in the lot of people have every right to condemn us
 yes imagine it imagine if I heard this I don't understand true but I heard this from a Mystic that before you die this may not be true if it is it's interesting I will just share that when you're dying and you see and feel upset that you see your life flash before your eyes but you see it flashing before your eyes from the people you've affected to give affected people to positive way they feel that love that
gave that man but all the people that you were actually hurt back it's flat so you're seeing it from their perspective and you're like oh wow I was so hurtful oh wow I betrayed this person oh wow I broke this person I think I'm in trouble I never read that in the bay the closet but I've heard it from a Mystic who's who does past life regression that you know we were just not as Stella said that's like what's that the Christmas A Christmas Carol Scrooge
 right you know that story you don't know screws are we laughing and then he kind of
sword almost dies and it gets shown how other people see him cut ghost comes back and take as well as those from Hell takes him I'll see how horrible he was to everybody goes from hell did I just make that up the change doesn't necessarily mean he'll I was a Ghost of Christmas Past Christmas Past and then the Ghost of Christmas present of the Ghost of Christmas future the three different thank you for that, thank you for this I hope that was helpful it's very difficult
 I think I understand I think they are as I think you know what I'm going to do this trip I'm going to that one it's my turn to talk I'm just going to read just read nice I think we should do that I'm down to do that so we can heat be in the hole and hear about Laura Catania and things will start to see put our consciousness
to the degree we were ready to hear them they'll make more and more substantial sense and they actually change your heart and I tell you I have so much appreciation because Hinduism is such an enigma and Lucky China extracted the most essential teachings and who knew nothing about Hinduism they knew nothing about the language or the culture of the rituals or the philosophy is where the different sects going around all they had was Google bought and they just whatever papa says we're doing and because of that probably is also like allergic Tanya teaching essential teachings he says and he would always say you know don't worry don't worry about this will go here's the essence of it
 it was nice to meet you and mean it probably years ago you to I want you to start marrying people how many people were supposed
perform the wedding the wedding sported chant Google's you don't need to know all those munchers probably did it very simply just as he checked the essence
 weird that's what we're going for here we're not the international Society for rituals we are we are we are in the business of love we want to learn how to love again and that's what we're in training for and the rituals assist the love
 you know it's not the other way around the rituals are just there to get us to love again you like that as if we're in the business of love where the pieces of love
okay alright alright who's next you know where and how they liked it all right question
 did you have someone that's older Ryan
 let's hear 49er Swiss German
 put down your crocheting
 how are you going to try to get to see it has been to India with me or us how many times total
 I have five at least I know I think we stopped counting the great in and rainy we leaving or a lot of time so we will have to hear your whole back story but your German you live in Switzerland to hardcore back in the days she even sought shelter play in 1991
right now I'd like to take a life Sig but you weren't into it you wanted to ask them where you you can tell us I'm not offended
 is that you were like
 oh I was at the club because I hung out at the club all the time
 but you saw shelter playing what do you think clearer like these guys are just crazy hair
 I thought you would have thought we were we were we were slightly odd that's okay I take no offense I watch run like the normal hardcore punk rock band sitting right here do I change my mind purple in case you didn't know
 Alice turn the song
turn it. Turn it the other way. Okay but it so I learned that Titania purple he is Krishna he comes in the mood of Radha Rani and in her complexion and first I actually wanted to ask like who's Katana Planet because there's something about Raja Rani with him too but then I thought maybe you can give us an overview of the whole bunch of tops because I learned there is still some more expansions but there's also string of us with Teva and summer and this is why we bet the questions are going off at the question if you can maybe give us a list of the how to make
I understand it
 cuz we were just Sarah and Cody was like so who's who and your answer was and I said I was going to ask that anyway so this is so Cody good question to ask a question
 all right we need to go to punch at top of school yeah the whole thing the whole thing the truth behind those punches as five
 which by the way is where the British got the word hunch from I'll give you 5 in the face now it's true I say that's where the word punch comes from
 that's not the question and you ask it.
read the divine feminine
 yeah I think it's interesting that ever really interesting things whenever there's an important person becomes to the Posse when she comes to the Posse no one travels. It's like a motorcades coming down like Fifth Avenue like all these other cars and they were already in the morning. And Ellie last time and there was all these cars coming before the p.m. came and all the ones before behind him came and you can't tell who's him he can't tell who is there a sort of like heading in there and he's got the guards got people so in the same way when when God comes it brings a posse and Entourage it comes with a male or to Tanya is not non different you know I think that's everything you're saying is exactly right it's just like that until we want from this conception from images from the Eastern perceptions would like say
 did the conceptions of God the rapper
that it in The Vedic literature new punishes and then went to speak of in the piranhas and the ship involved with time
 we have if we're going to approach this topic we have to kind of get past the more simple maybe I should say simplistic ways of thinking about God you know this is very simplistic idea that borders this judge that create everything then the judge everyone heat You Were Meant to submit and that's kind of how it works really we understand Krishna as the origin of everything that everything that exists
 is a blend of his energies and he has different types of energies right that's the same one source of energy manifest and all kinds of energies and ultimately what is the purpose of it the purpose is just that it's a way that he enjoys the way that he plays he healed manifest in order to spread love
to be present in that play
 then there has to be other entities that have free will and so we are those entities with free will but we're granted Independence for granted innocence Independence were granted the freedom to choose to love in return
 and so then but we he doesn't matter if it's only like in other he creates this world that the material energy that is made out of that our bodies are made out of he even to use the word creates is a little misleading because these are all Eternal things but he you know from him manifest all the living beings but also he manifests in different chakras are different types of energies that he also plays with like Rada you know that that that shocked he talked for like that's that's the divine feminine energy that that possesses up for him that he possesses left for in the end so he has his adventures in that sense and he also
Man versus avatars in all different varieties that play in all different ways so he's just got a very complex way of granting freedom and Independence and then playing in that realm that is all the men in that even for the for the play to go in deeper he forgets even but you know who he is and who he's dealing with so that so that the play could be deeper in the in the feelings and it could be still still deeper so the punch of Todd was like five ways that he manifests for five principles five Truth by different categories of ways that God manifest so there's three takes on himself at 3 take Tanya is Krishna he's not even an avatar exactly sometimes will calm in Avatar but really it's just Krishna in a different mood Krishna with the different complexion but as we were saying before is Krishna coming to taste the love feel the love that writer feels
and then he also manifest as nityananda and did you know this is a very complex topic who is Mitch Ananda but it's Krishna again
 but it's Krishna kind of in a supporting role of Krishna it's him but he's doing all that he can to serve Krishna with love
 but it's still Krishna like with all that with all that power and and all that in in the even his compassion manifest is extended further through nityananda hit Nation Under The Groove the principal grew extends through nityananda so another words all the all the knowledge and blessings that we need to understand how to return to Krishna comes through nityananda and since I let you know there's an extension of krishna's or J Tanya's Mercy
 and then there's equator and honestly if I hear the scenes described I don't really understand
that he is he is Krishna
 he's also Shiva is Maha Vishnu he some I don't my mind and my knowledge of all in my in the blessings that I've received have not grown to to understand that I pray that someday I'm going home now I get it but I'm not there so I just accept that as it's been explained how can I help me wipe my butt but he manifested as the external he manifests as the leader of the Russian of a community in in my poor here you know so it's so he has beautiful passed on to treat your tongue is about a guy if he is Chris
 he is treated Tanya calling for she cheat on you to come through his deity of Krishna
is there compassion being felt and he's he's he's looking at the community of David Weaver my poor the time which is all like his arrogance Scholars and muslim-hindu tensions and all this and from the depths of the core of his being nice is only thing that can bring any real devotional life is if Krista comes himself so he cries for Krishna and then there's good a Target or externally Christmas childhood friend
 Deadlight Street attorney takes in your ass you know and then lives with him in in Emporia where he's diving into the deepest love but but it's our Charter says that that is Rod that that to that Rod if you know from glaucoma David is manifesting as good at her and
 when you really understand deeply who Rod is and who Christian is you understand more about the Darrell
between your daughter I'm operable there's a scene where you know your daughter has taken chantress in Yas Amin he's like he's a sanyasi and he doesn't leave that janitorial that stays Val and then shoot your tongue is going to go to bring David I get out I can't stand the separation just like Rada can't stand the separation from Krishna and they comes to finally become 21 River Christian just said you stay here
 and I'm going to go and they cross the river and get out of Paints in the deepest Ecstasy of love and separation so good out her is Radha feeling those emotions in the same types of emotions in a different setting and is it just like we like to play in one setting that we play in another setting you know so now it's it's it's a player brought in Krishna Leela Broad and Christian manifesting in another way but did the really deep esoteric devotees
really understand more deeply what's happening and appreciate it on some level that I'm not capable of and then the fifth is I'm sure about sponge it who is that that's the Geva he represents said the souls and she bodyguard about to Brenda does the gourd about to run to the the the the group of the devotees of Sri chaitanya beginning with she wants and she must have said is it's some it's not a money so it's so you know it's it's it's it's kind of the leader in one sense of the of the devotional Shiva devotional Souls you know but that's all they are also a manifestation of sujay Tanya so it's you that wants you to turn in manifesting and fiber ideas of energy that they
 somehow encapsulate
 his purpose in his Lila's
 I can't say much more than that you know pretty good pretty good
wonderful question okay all here
 good to have you welcomed pleasant surprise story how you got here what your story is you know tell us about yourself where you from
 Pico born in Jersey and lives in Colorado mainly until the pandemic originally from Puerto Rico I thought in your last live your reply to Rico do you move to Puerto Rico well I was born in Jersey but moved as one in mature about brought across the river I understand now
from Puerto Rico yes and so I was in Colorado and pandemic came and then Krishna took my husband and I to Kentucky where I delve deep into bhakti actually met at WT in Kentucky Middle School many people go to learn about buck teeth Totino Strawberry Fields and then I met Cindy from Susan introduced me to you and I found out you were going to India I was like I think this is what I'm going to do with that was a great trip wasn't it you are the juggler Pourri trip
evening news
 so easy question send the Latin Hispanic culture I feel like a lot of us refer to God as stop by the old like Father God not as formal male casual
 Big Poppa sometimes you call him Big Papi I love it when you call me Big Poppa so I was just wondering like where that falls in the Rosses because it's not one it's like this specifically deleted and blocked the I feel like when you go through the main Ross's so I was just wondering how that kind of feel very interesting question question thank you I will
 well yeah that's a whole judeo Christian culture of God worship and it's sort of a way of people worship say
Vishnu worship God is our Father God is our source God is our life God is all-knowing God knows what's in my heart how can I got is that is revered cuz he's so powerful and it is true like that also within bhakti but in Crittenden Krishna bhakti there's there's more nuanced ways cuz Christmas form is less
 less of that of power and more of that as adorable Ness and sometimes even Christian a vulnerable like who's going to feed Krishna oh no Christian is cold let's get a cheddar and Christian is a Christmas service we do Christmas crying Christmas hungry right now how can I feed Krishna so we don't often think of like you know we should look at it wrong wrong with this newest and maintainer so sort of like Papa Dios but Krishna sort of like little baby little baby deals sweet baby Diego
wait about that sweet baby. Like you were saying manifests and all different ways so he does manifest his father by Chris Christie says that I'm to see given father rights and in many ways or I was just thinking good now that we're here in another tweet what is the song that's in on the massage on what you say is in a Christian Christian Christian Nativity text my mother Christians my father Christmas the the the Lord of my life right now that's a good one that's a good day tomorrow just walking around Krishna Krishna Pizza Krishna pranidhana he gives me my very prompt and yeah and he's called in bug navigate to he calls himself at the beach or the pizza by the Sea giving father so so in many ways Christian is the father
 you can say the material
is the mother and he impregnates the material energy is the father and it's and I think we can we can accept it that doesn't just mean he's not just like a father that abandoned he sticks around so there is a fatherly aspect to Krishna scare you know he also does have children himself into Arco and I saw in many ways Krishna manifest fatherly love whether it's to his direct sons in dwarka or whether it's to the the universe in a sense that he's the universal father why were there let's put Mary on the hot seat Mara name one of krishna's son's name to Christian songs
 the ten-year-old got it Samba
 on a router network has the father
we can stop there I was good so yeah it's an interesting question because I think it just does kind of indicate what we're speaking about that his energies manifests is the mother to cuz the material energy is his energy it is him so he is he saw his in one sense he's everything you know
 is Christmas love us as father Lawrence am I
 you know love is a is in one sense Love Is Love in another sense there's varieties and I love and one can compare them I see like in Daytona Charger Merry Christmas coverage good for me some of that eloquently with a question like that right I know is Love sometimes Love Is Love
once she'll probably speaking about devotees who were kind of prematurely diving into hold on quote relishing the pastimes of Christian to go peace and an enormous I discuss probably says they're saying that the globe is love is that somehow you showed his love his mother's love is is inferior like like he was kind of upset but then another times probably straight out tell you know the love of the gopis is the highest level ball so to say that someone loving God is a father is lower I suppose there are there are there are kind of
 measurements that we could use that that you could say that's true but in another sense
 whatever love that someone has forgot has to be shown the great respect and appreciation so even when we have loved a baby cry
country worship Allah to go power worship Krishna as are our lover or Krishna as our friend there's always a deeper understanding like Christians the origin of everything also you know unless you're fully appear devoting to wrap them where's my friend Krishna where's my friend but for the most part people are worshipping Krishna in that friendship relationship her child relationship but ultimately understand Christian the source of everything also
 and even mother used to look at put into that understanding when Krishna opens his mouth and sees the entire universe in his mouth and she's like what am I saying it another way to say cool and $0.01 for we2
 2 in any way in a sense judge would ever loved someone has because all prescription appreciates all the varieties right so someone
 someone loving him in that way Saturday

 it can't move him he'll say that
 same time he's manifested like unlimited spiritual plans for people have loved with all reverence that he enjoys and appreciates so he's mad if he says different things in different moods the job that was a softball hits
