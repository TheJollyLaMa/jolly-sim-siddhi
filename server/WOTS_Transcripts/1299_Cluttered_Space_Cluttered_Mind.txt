 and back to Center in New York City
 you know what I purchased YouTube Prime
 and now I can download videos and I started with downloading the chase honey abaga but which is all in audio that's what I'm in the plan I can listen to Lorde cheat on his past I'm so happy that I never buy exclusive things like that no not Amazon Prime YouTube premium
 where you can download the videos on your phone so now I can listen to them when I'm flying is that good or lectures or whatever I've got since you've wandered off into this squirrel about you now you're going to get run with it run with the squirrel
 since I clicked on one video now it's like all the comes
what do you mean you know how the Heather's algorithms work you know right so which video did you click on I clicked on a video that showed like a dog that's like
 uncared for and it's got like it's just overgrown like a hundred dreadlocks like really thick dirty ones it's a shape like that she should yes it's it looks exactly like a ship like that and it looks it it's sad to see the dog in that condition
 and then someone took that dog day today to know they take it like there's a people that just drive around and they pick up those dogs and they they take him to like a veterinarian like set up and they shave them Shear them and pull out the ticks and they defeated well and they give it a shampoo and then they bring it back and put them back on the street
clean what book you know the first one I saw they did they put him right back but I was thinking cuz I was thinking you know there's something to learn here and then it would probably do it with hippies basically pick them up off the street shave their heads is actually heavy like these big thick dreadlocks sometimes it's like the whole back is like one big thick dreadlocks you know matted they're all mad across the ferry has been they also will look no not with these dogs it's not like that it's just like it's just sad and the shave them all up and then the poor dog is so you can see just how worn down it's become it's like stronger from No Way Around you haven't see I've seen them I'm telling you about it just try to hear me out the poor dog is you can just see suffered so much and nobody's, giving it any care
and these people come by and they shave it up and they shampoo at they pick the pick out every little take that stuck on his body sometimes it has some other kind of weird growths going on underneath they treat those redone with this pundit I think this is what party does for some you know then then at the end you said the dog is like it's fresh and it's a live in it and it's got its life back and and that's really what we are we don't realize the burden that were killed the anxieties the resentments the fears us down jobs and it's weighing us down and then when you see that talk once it's been shaved and once it's been care for it and and and and they give me the special shampoo and everything you know that they really take good care of it and then it's like it's a happy dog again it's like his tail is wagging like crazy because just so you know it's so grateful also so
a dog and a cat you a dog man that's okay I did have a dog when it's going up pepper pepper pepper use that against you one day that's what you come up with let me use this against your appointment let me just finally wrap that point is that I don't think we know just how much weight we're carrying and dumb and ugly need to allow this process but he don't be afraid of it you know sometimes I'd imagine those dogs that run away from the person is going to shave them up you know Rugrats over here up in here
 we're running away from the very people they can save us up we're fraid they have to if the dog has to surrender
shave it up and then it's alive again that's what this process to become a great analogy
 and I just got all those videos like my house back and just needs to hug Katie and also unhappy with the way really take good care of these hoes they read a good can you see how well they do with the whole 3 years nugget mr. squirrel Professor squirrel it's from John Deere abrir I think it really takes a French person that pronounces cuz we just don't make sounds like this we don't make sense like that Barrack and American businesses have like a friend I have no idea how to say the name of
a little chain restaurant there I have no idea how to say the name of it
 what's that other there's other it's like isn't it this is a bad strategy nobody can say I just had a great meal at so I'm just not going to bring it up
 Ava Martinez and that you pronounce it pretty well I think that's like they make sounds like this but we even try to save it
 so we don't even try don't even turn them we never get good at exactly
so we got a nugget from Sean did it become okay it's motive alone which gives character to the actions of men it's motive character character to the actions of men how much I think about getting out Sean John he was a philosopher moralist and he was noted for his satire
 but dumb to share your thoughts on this right now
 say it again
 it's motive alone that gives character to the actions of men I'll get you started on this one
 let's look at his action he fought he lost he knew how to lose how do we how do we characterize the action always a loser he failed did he fail or did he succeed you succeeded he died but he succeeded how so because his intention was
you know what motive yeah his motive his intention was I'm going to I'm going to die fighting for Lauren wrong I'm okay with that and that's what that's what he was trying to win but yeah it wasn't like I'm just going to die I'm going to I'm going to do everything I can to save Sita to save seats and and and and and us he is known for like this Stellar character
 yes yes it sucks so just for people that may not know there's one seater as a bird there's a bird abducted by Ravenna in a flying Chariot is so he he took her flying up and there's a bird to tell you he was a powerful Warrior actually there with us if you're new to the show actually who's any of the vaulters and he was a very powerful King but he was old also he was very very old and when he saw seat that's that's Lord rounds
Teresita
 and she's being abducted by the horrible Robin a love me I'll do all that I can I'm going to try but I'm going to try to save her she flies up in the air any he puts up a pretty good fight
 but he gets you do any fancy to sing don't do it right
 I'm trying to figure bike if anyone's new listening to the show going hold on let me get this straight talk about a bird right there's a bird devotee of rum I need to talk see this is why we're driving people away from Krishna Consciousness we got to we got to go slow or with a flying Chariot yeah well the donkeys that pulled it blew their heads so so he gave his all the failed externally if you were to try to characterize
his action without looking at the motive you say he failed
 but actually even though he failed you know on the surface level
 because he gave everything to his motive was entirely selfless was entirely pure was entirely in service to Lord Rama to Sita sure it was an absolute success right complete success
 and this is this idea you know looking at the motive it's it's really one when we when we speak about Bucky on the show or when the vice numbers in general. Do you know the year of the buck Yogi's when they speak abducted the say things like
 how long will rob God sit there staring on a crocodile
text 10 minutes of you when you were here last I know before you go like over here
 but that Instagram it was like you're talking and I
 that was you or you're just doing that again
 totally out there then I sat there we should it I mean it would be interesting if you would have time to how long you would have just sat there staring with me saying nothing that lives with me when we speak
Bucky won the Viking of is in the back of your geese when they speak of bhakti they will, they speak of it as being Superior right Bucky is superior to, and Gianna right yeah and intends people might say all why are you being so sick terrenal your path is better than anyone else but it's her problem is the highest what do you three other religion what is categories are
 are there they're steps in in evolution and the evolution is based on the motive in other words for the motive the more it is evolved and that's why I bought your Superior because the motive is entirely pure the motive behind Karma
 did this world of you you could say, right is that I want to enjoy the things of this world
 and someone with through through knowledge they may evolve beyond that to the
from Afghan where they say I've recognized it that kind of thinking ultimately it just leads to suffering I don't need it I can let go of the things in this world I want to find peace that's an evolution you know according to The Vedic Paradigm you've evolved but then there's still another level of evolution to go where one says you know what my motive is not to enjoy the things of this world my motive is also not to just find peace through renunciation
 might as well head pieces good in this bigger picture then one was more becomes entirely selfless they're capable of acting out of love my love just becomes the only motive they said the motive is no longer selfish is entirely selfless that's an evolution you'll find and be with the way that we can understand that this is not sectarian is because you'll find that same evolution in all the different spiritual
and you can find that evolution in Christianity can find it in Buddhism you can find it in Judaism you can find it in Native American or psychics yule-yule that's always that is the spiritual path to purify the motive and so Jean de Libya yeah has you know he's on to something here what he saying you know what it's not so much the action that you can't really characterize the action without knowing the motive once you know the motive you can say whether something was good or bad weather was successful or failure ultimately it's the mode of the accounts and so the vatio is all of the ritual all of the teachings all of the month chanticleer all the different practices really you could boil it down to its just oh it's all about purifying that motive until there's nothing left
 but you're lost like all that praying right it's kind of like
stealing the heart you could say you know distilling the Consciousness which is still in the heart until it's entirely pure of selfish motive and only then is when really capable of what you would call unconditional love right as long as you have selfish motive even the motive is like I just want peace you know even that's got to be distilled out of there and then you get the Pure Heart right to your love and we collectively call that talked to your grandma and booked you there is it's all a win all of your son was your intention is the right place it to win there's a lot of things in the material world if your intention is good I intend I intend to grow was it bushels of corn this year bushels and bushels of corn planted it and then it was like there was a late Frost or
 got something some Blythe's and it didn't grow
and then my bushel shouldn't grow and then I've lost I had a great intentions but I've lost in the stock market I had a great intention to make a lot of money but I lost a loser called failure in the material world in the spiritual world if that intention is fine-tuned you not in the straightest you there was always a shirt that there was a t-shirt that said good intentions are not enough I hated that t-shirt yes they are everything's not going to Rebrand that straight edge t-shirt could have whenever I heard that she was like you Dum Dums good intention is everything is in what sense is all that we can control we can try to control be on there but really are tension is the one thing that we can really deal with ya
 purify that the purity of our spiritual nuggets er do you think Jean dated
I'm impressed at that Martin she gave you a thumbs up on your pronunciation your crush with me or Martini press with you you're welcome
 I wasn't okay where we sat Ryan I'm going to skip the wrench I even put them in some material before 7 my time which is our Barry means of Conquest what should I expect the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Rishi the super must you a demon to mother she responds to the goddess of learning and she'll be off today at the author
 nystop reissue about racial nature and buy a service to all this trouble from the heart with muriatic acid
and loving service that the Supreme Lord who is praise with transit in the songs will be established as a revocable fact check student registration fee but I was born in the darkness of ignorance by teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer to pay since he's at their load of speech
 you know it's important to read those in a little bit hard right now thinking about while he was chatting as much as you lose the meaning behind them I like that was born the doctors about to become like these I remember being in Catholic Church relax father father life-form that you got from to God we got to make sure I didn't know what I'm saying I just said it
like a computer but in other words even be like that in this one this time around to the Nugget In other words even if you would have said it exactly with perfect memorization was no heaven or years are your motives you didn't even happen there was no clear motive behind it it's it's actually meant to to bring out a motive is wrong I'd guess what I thought it was maybe give us give us this day our daily bread and for three years I thought jelly bread was sacred my mom always made me jelly bread give us this day our daily bread and as we forgive those who trespass against whatever
 he did that for years. Just cuz you're just saying it and saying it
not even understand what you're saying you got to break a daddy got to stay with a little drama you don't have proprietary intention there you go thank you
 okay where we at 7 chapter 7
 so a lot of speaking to the kids
 Pilatus describes the path of bhakti in some detail
 he's going on to say that like
 then when you start to experience this body you almost feel like a madman to people you either you start you know you're you're you're feeling these ecstasies and people are looking at you like what's the matter with this guy he looks like it how many Channing is dancing is crying he's doing all these things
friends may be saying wow it has that kind of fact I like it you know it it's it's I don't have wild you know and so now they might say okay it sounds like you really got some kind of special
 kick out of this bucket practice you know it's kind of like it. It's it sounds like it's kind of a thrill it's you know some
 it's just a while is a trip or something like that but let's get back to like our serious yoga studies she will leave you from suffering does it relieve you from some sorta you know the wheel of birth and that because my understanding by reading the upanishads and books like this is that if you want to become free from the sufferings of this world you it's it's through Guiana is through detachment
pronunciation of that looks like really sober so you're saying no no there's a spiritual Pathak looks a little festive and even a little wild is really delivering the results can I can you can it's so actually we're going to talk about Gianna and for a couple verses and he's going to talk about Karma you know product so it's open right now for lies and believe me you know it's not just some silly running around crying thinks I know it's frees you from some Sarah I'm telling you that whatever again I'll give you it gives you that and that ecstasy on top of it so that's text 37 we get into it
 doesn't have to be solemn all the time he would have made it right I like it I get it but I'm over it
text Thursday I want to read it text 37 the real problem of Life are you ready for the real problem life you think you got problems here is the real problem of Life the real problem of life is the repetition of birth and death which is like a wheel rolling repeatedly up and down you don't like when you're born a tire going up and then you get to live like a midlife crisis driving along and I see myself as like on the way down fast but like I'm looking at the pavement right now that's how I feel if there if it is a wheel I forgot to use that analogy I feel like Here Comes Your Life Is Good
 yeah I am I'm not complain about my life I'm just saying I'm looking face down on the pavement right now I'm not like 21 I'm looking up we're going up. Lot of plans things are good got plans how often do men like happiness to stress
you get to the top could do like 12 I was picturing the wheel to okay I'm leaving from right leading from the pay of I wasn't I guess
 no but I was seeing him in and I think it's the way you're saying is totally valid I was seeing it more like ups and downs of life that you might even go up and down several times in one day you know that's not what I meant I'm told I would prolong I know that was you I was talking to the birth and death and I said we saw different ways not the one of us has to be right now but I'm just saying my point is when you're young there's tons of Hope in the air and then the width
UFC UFC fighter I came to that decision at a certain point in my life that's not happening that windows closed you know I mean it could be a baseball cop
 baseball player
 I always wanted to be a cop or a baseball player they will not take me at this point in my life because you're too old
 want me
 the window is closing for my guest area code that I was just saying that I was seeing another way I don't think one was right around his wrong but I was hearing a lot about the ups and downs of one may go through you know you did that it's just the life is just constant ups and downs about that life is one big up and down but like there's all kinds of us that's that's all I saw.
shut up you could tell it was a Tarot reader it was pretty obvious thinking about retiring soon I was told that she read it in the cards she read it yeah I know but I must give off that Vibe like this guy's War far is exhausted okay let's continue this verse are not the real problem of life this wheel however completely stops when one is in touch with the Supreme personality of godhead in other words but the transcendentalists realize I from constant engagement and devotional service and that's real by the way
 what is completely liberated from Material existence okay that's big continue
all learning men know this there for my dear friends of Sons Sons of the Demons right he's talking to his schoolmates immediately begin meditating upon and worshipping the Super Soul within everyone's heart very interesting so he's saying listen kids it's not just me the same as Alderman or people that really have understood the message or in all of these texts they all get this point it's not just me that if you serve that it is he says why you think I'm sorry for yourself or hearing the teachings of these have been handed down by great sages with thousands of years so onerous a little bit about yourself
 so he says he says budget mom
birthday yay for the East Forum worshiping that God is right in your own heart he's right there is inside you right he's inside you hid it in the next person to talk more about that it's interesting, but what do you get through that what do you achieve he says Brahma Nirvana sukahorn that this through this Bliss he's saying I'm too I've been describing this person that chanting and dancing and Bliss and you're wondering if you really deeply spiritual does he get all the results of renunciation and I know it. He gets all that from this Bliss through that Bliss you get yeah she says Brahma Nirvana
 you get Nirvana you get this I mean you know nothing this
 something like that yeah they're like a means to blow Savannah means like blown this is at least one interpretation of it in
knee are the niece Ms Outlook blown out like he has to look all that just like what's on my shaving up that dog and you know like we we've got all this big dick matted stuff all over us fear confusion illusion and be crazy desires lost resentment all of the Star age remind me that it's all blown out right so we sent all that blows out all that stuff that people when they're thinking about spirituality in these conventional ganick terms
 your box delivers all that no doubt you get all that
 can you also get all this ecstasy it's got you a dancing around and it's on all right
 oh my God continues to this this this concept of the
 is part of Mama's to grab all my friends sons of the asuras the Supreme personal
God head in his Super Soul featuring exist always exists within the course of the hearts of all living entities indeed he is a well-wisher and friend of all living entities and there is no difficulty in worshiping the Lord why then should people not engage in his devotional service why are they so addicted to to unnecessarily producing artificial paraphernalia or sense gratification
 and what's it what's it what's an what's an example of artificial paraphernalia oh God is everywhere
 bungee jumping bungee jumping bungee jumping's artificial totally create this thing that this is going to make us happy or not he's going to eat that your heart is like a whole host okay
what's an artificial paraphernalia
 about a truck
 hahaha she sitting here in the conversation she's going after me and my truck okay
 those are in One sensors are practically but still even still debris do you say yeah you don't need this truck we don't need a job that's far away we don't need because if we live simply in this conversation in a few verses is going to start to go towards simplicity
 that we're working really hard to try to get happiness out of life when really the more that we work at it the more that we suffer this I have it let's all take a moment and just close your eyes and envision cuz stupid bungee jump a little bit on the top a little bit
you brought a bungee jumping so now we're trying to imagine you doing it
 okay text 38 let's stick with yeah let's continue with 38 cuz there in this commentary
 I want this word problem a lot of saying so simple that we might kind of miss it and any saying the Super Soul is right in your heart
 it's like you don't everybody's got this it's not like you have to work hard to get like if if I think my happiness like you were saying when your kid like I want to be like a professional baseball player
 not everybody's got that that's really hard to achieve you got to work very hard at it and still you may not get it it's not going to be accessible to everyone even someone might just not have the might just be born without the physical capabilities of it or they might not have you know that the opportunities that they might not meet the right coach I got the right trainer or whatever it is
is not open to everyone you know and even if it is open you might still work hard at it and and not be able to get it we sent our mom is right in everyone's hard there's not one living being it doesn't have this opportunity you don't have to go anywhere you don't have to meet someone special or be born in a certain family or get some special lucky opportunity we all have this and so proper licensing am he says the Lord is compared to the sky
 okay interesting because the sky is vast
 yet within the reach of all
 not only human beings but even the animals right so it's like there's not one living person that can say like I don't have access to see this guy super fast you know but at the same time it's available to everyone to say since the Supreme Lord in his poor Mama featuring exist as the best well-wisher and friend
 as confirm
greatest Sia Joe Sequoia Lord it is super seal feature always stays in the heart along with the living entity the Lord is so friendly
 is a living entity remains within the heart so they won't can always contact him without difficulty
 very interested this is it almost can just slip right by he's right there at every moment connection can be made anymore at it later in the end and is very friendly welcoming is is coming along with you he's coming along he's kind of like the dog shaper I can have sex you know how he's he's riding along as I got the buzzers and I'm ready to shave you I'm here I'm here in the past and the dog's eye contact when you need help a continuous he says one may live alone anywhere in any condition and simply sit down
meditate upon the Super Soul enchanting hear about the Lord that's there is no difficulty in approaching the lure
 right there okay so so relaxing to his friends you're wondering you know Does this bhakti does it deliver the results of get yeah you can from a Nirvana through this and it's available to everyone you just have to turn in side it's right there in your heart okay what about, what about the motive of, you know what if you're driven not the desire to find peace and escape the sufferings of this world with the desire to get the things of this world does how does that relate to this bucket practice that you're describing let's continue I think I'm a comment. Text Belen. It's a tough order
 tall but I think he's kind of arguing the opposite here he's kind of saying
I mean it's true when one says it is a tall order and another since it's right there in available for everyone right and easy we want love we want the easiest forms of love you know we wanted it's mixed with tons of motives with people that we let love us in return that we we have a we have an agenda and expectations what we want out of love this is pure devotional services like a highest form of refined love like a refined
 what's what's refined refined Concha distilled clarified butter removed everything all the impurities gone on the impurities out of it you
 x39 the karmic Viewpoint ones riches their beautiful wife their female friends once Sons and Daughters ones residence one's domestic animals
 like house elephants
I got a domestic elephant and horses ones treasury Economic Development and sense gratification indeed even the lifetime in which one could enjoy all these opulence is that are certainly temporary and flickering I think it's part of me and makes up who I am
 is is just not even yours it's all going to be packing the boxes and shipped away cuz he was just telling me like their parents are getting old and they're going to move in with her and I can have been with them and you're like yeah my mom's got all the stuff tons of junk she's attached to and just ship it up and get rid of it and that's our life someone's going to get all that stuff you got in the house I'm looking at everybody's house is right now I'm looking at every little screen on Zoom all these things you value all those Moana
throw it away right now paintings in it and stuff it's all going to be put in a box and ship the storage and then eventually thrown out or gone through the Goodwill take him to Goodwill you can find all those paintings on your wall at Goodwill all your books at Goodwill or in what's that really good TV show where they they unlock the storage container and you will you get all the stuff that's in there you know it's kind of like that one now that's a good one so much talking about the storage container is like Treasures of the storage containers you just say what I think you said temporary Storage Wars thank you you can track her and even the lifetime in which one can enjoy all these material is there are certainly temporary and flickering
 yes since the Opera
that's a great word flickering flame it's it's not standing Steph it's moving constantly since the opportunity
 of human life is temporary what benefit can these material opulence is give to a sensible man who has understood himself to be Eternal. So this word for Lakshmi Devi is Chum Chum Chum Chum Chum flickering she's like a flame and Lakshmi Devi is flickering because Lakshmi or money right wealth in this world Fortune our stuff off our Good Fortune Lady Luck she's flicker she comes and goes as he sometimes appears without like knocks on your door without a text message she just shows up hey guess what
 yes and inheritance the stock markets have gone up there's a piece of real estate someone left something to you and your will whatever it is sometimes you have this Good Fortune financially and then sometimes
she just disappears I bet you just got a letter from the IRS what does it say there are auditing you or they're going through all your stuff they want and you lose so much and this is Lakshmi she turns out she's flickering she comes and goes everything of this material world is like this Cheung Chau flickering like the flame interesting if we're going, let's hear about clutter and that kind of stuff you know I'm asking stuff during storage container store to get it's true like sometimes I can't visit like you like your name you like in a holy place and you go into the room or like the home I'd like a sadhu
 and some of them just have like a place that just like
 you step in there's no clutter that's your house man
everything is like I can't even understand it I don't get it I don't understand you man I love you I like you and you're a cool person but we're just stuff you've got no stuff would look there's a lot of stuff but it's just good shelving and everything like that now but but really empty and there's a feeling that you feel
 like you know in your mind that's kind of again very light is kind of against shaving that dog off right he's carrying around all of it
 thick matted hair you know it's like the Mind feels light when you are into that room you know that you have a big house you just caught her that you'll just fill it up more more clutter yeah you would have a massive basement and
Keystone building up AJ Sauvignon the chapter he says you don't realize how much nonsense we amassed until you have to help your parents move and downsize is it was all right it's just passing the things we didn't he says it's the things we hold onto because we just might need them later
 in that statement is a really good statement because it shows an opposite the opposite mentality of the sadhu right the satyr doesn't let me hold on to this because I might need it later the satyr says Krishna gives me whatever I need
 but he always provides for me what I need so let me just pass this on you. I don't need to amass this because what if I think we'll what happens 10 years down the road I might be needing this isn't tennis on the Roku Channel give me what I need to know it's still interesting though maybe he doesn't
