 then we're doing the whole separate trip to go to my app or is there a new is think my poor Pilgrim in my purse really special place and it's on the website check it out it's another day of the live Q&A day who do we got first here so conditioned to Chandra Chandra down
 we love nityananda chandrika dedicated dedicated to bhakti and in his dedication there is just like a
in a current that goes with it like what's it called when a book is right quick that leaves a hole start that over
 we never unmuted when it turned off
 start over
 we're back everyone sorry was technical difficulties apologized Zoomers
 the question was we see a often two different models of mostly we see the model of the desire is in something inherent that just like the Light Bulb Has It's a white white lights and why
why has all these different colors of spectrum is there but that when you put a blue paint over the bulb then all of those are being held back and just a don't like it's a covering or Corruption of the original thing as any other model is where we see is his desire something external that the Consciousness is reaching out and desires are a functioning of the Mind the the the the mine is this like a
 we identify as we say the those are not my thoughts but we are not our thoughts are with the Consciousness reaches out and attaches itself to the the desires that are flowing through the blood so they sit one seems to transact one and one seems external to the South so I think I understand the nature of the so that the question essentially is where does desire reside doesn't reside in the self
so does he reside in the mind or you can even get further confused and I think it has to do with just language more than would there's a philosophical
 disagreement within bucktee or yoga Circle Sundays
 only a sentient being can desire
 and the mind itself is not a sentient being the mines According to some key and coordinates the entire flight is a in sentient instrument there is subtle
 but still insists this matter is composed of matter what we do here language it maybe it's poetic or kind of conventional language that even in the bug of agita the third chapter is it describes were,
 in Pinchot propods translation he uses the word lust but, can be translated last I can be you can be translate simplest desire so desire
accessory says desire exist in the census in the mind and in the intelligence I think so if you hear that then it's so my senses and sometimes politically say like the eyes desire to see beautiful Vision since you know the the ears desire to hear sweet sounds but they do it's that it's a cell that desires it's only it's only the conscious self that has desire but is filtered through programming just as the white light of a filament in a light bulb
 comes out blue
 it's not the blue shell that's giving the light it's the white filament within it but it comes out blue so you could say
 that the blue came from from the ball not from the filament but it's but there is no life without
tell minutes to film it that actually has desire and then it's transformed or warped as it comes through the mind and so the mind has programming in it that's attractive right now that you know what we
 even just like we see like say your child when your mind is really most valuable when it's really it's taking in through the senses so much information and it is being shaped so we're being told happiness lies here you know misery lies there this is attracted this is unattractive this is cool this is not cool this is and so that y'all get shaped and then artists are natural desire as it filters through that takes on that shape so poetically we could say that the desire resides in the mines but factually it's only the second to The Cider
 I love this concept we have in our
 philosophy is that pure Soul Fiat
it's almost given us a treasure map at like all we have to do is understand that there is like this hunk of gold that's within us
 and it just gets covered over and it's not like the hunk of gold has ever gone it's always there and we can hear descriptions of what it is but there's just different filters are ever going to a hotel where they have those blackout curtains you just close the curtain everything is black imagine some bright light cover that with hundreds of layers of blackout curtains that's what's going on with the salt mine to the degree that we become more and more God, just one more scarcely conscious champ and a few early it's like lifting one of those sometimes you meet a person on the street they just they are a bright light star bright light they have almost like the last couple rings on them but they have to and it could be coming from a previous life we can't answer why is this person is not even at the spur
reality they're just worried about a brighter person but it's because they're carrying some of these from a previous life into this world and according to their activities in this life they're going to get more covered right cuz we get covered we get filtered by the people we associate with that's why I good parent is always saying who those kids are hanging out with their was checking in with the kid who they're hanging out with what they're doing a party you going to who's going to be at the party cuz there's some inherent idea that the company we keep influences us and so in devotional service we try to get high grade influence in our life we searched it out not to make a spiritual we already are spiritual is to uncover those layers and uncover those filters to get to that gold that was already there I was an add-on I think as soon as I answered your question thank you ditching on the Challenger air conditioner
what's your name where you from I'm from West Chester oh really what part the Westchester okay welcome to how do you listen to the podcast how did you find out about the podcast
 I've been into a sort of Hardcore forever if you sheltered to podcast hardcore hundreds of years ago stick with land in the future they'll be a noisy under Musical music in the performances will include punching each other
throwing oneself from the stage but they will be the disseminators up this great mysterious information and they all the disciples you like are you sure are you sure this was a vision of nightmare are you okay Annie waits to welcome to the show let me slide in a little tight speller spelled my cord and you're shy so okay so my question is in the you know the bug of agita right we have this idea that we do our duty and we take action but bhagavan gives the results of the of the actions of this enables us to accept whatever comes to us as Prasad from Bhagavad and gracefully accept your circumstances or answering questions
it's got it all figured out
 right you know you'll have some degree of free will that and it's sort of acting outside of a bag of bonds you know got a present so now you can imagine situation I decide to walk down a dark alley at night I get mugged so in that case is the karma walking to the galley do I take his prashad getting mugged or do I say wait a minute that's an abuse of that person's free will that stop Rashad from that's not bag of on isn't causing you to get mugged there it's that person the muggers abusive free will that is the problem and that's sort of outside of this concept of Karma Yoga where you take the prashad from from baghban is that right that's great question on this day you will be known as to the philosopher
yes so it's so let's try to let's try to condense that question down and if I understand correctly what you're asking is
 can everything be seen as krishna's Grace or are there pockets of Free Will where Christmas Grace doesn't penetrate these are these are around these are areas where in that Grace doesn't flow where we've kind of got in gotten in the way that sum it up okay I'll miss both in one sense the Grace Flows everywhere
 we will you know we have the question the other the other weekend or so that was similar to the side where does the darkness in the world come from if Christian is all loving and merciful than how we're all these dark areas and we said it's kind of when we when the shadow
our own selfishness gets in the way of Christmas light on the world that these dark areas show up so it's not the Christmas creating the darkness but it's where we turn away from Krishna where we get between Christian the world that the darkness but even the darkness
 serves a purpose
 and so did the ideas that are free will could be we could kind of simplify our Free Will down to a very simple formula do we have two choices one to take shelter of Krishna
 or two to take shelter of this world it is centrally that's what it comes down to when we choose to take shelter of Krishna everything
 becomes his everything in our life is directly his personal
directly person involved in when we choose to take shelter of his external energy this world then we're kind of put into an automated system and automated system of karma where our actions bring about automated reactions and those are the actions that you're disgusting right there where we're split but we're we're even
 even something something seems to be just a manifestation of free will think to think of it this way and it won't sense let's let's talk about government in a theoretical sense theoretically the government cares for all of the citizens theoretically yeah and the end and let's say that you had a personal relationship would like the president
 I ordered even like to even make a tighter announce USA with a king right so if you if you have a direct relationship with the king and you say you know what I just want to satisfy you the nature of our work
Bishop is everything to me that came can be directly involved in whatever's going on in your life
 but should you turn away from the King then you would enter into the realm of the king's law and you like every other citizen you would just be kind of operating in one sense outside of the Kings Direct
 awareness
 but actually that that the law has been set up by the king also as a manifestation of his caring that's so there's a penal system within that law and so on this protecting all the citizens that's reforming citizens when necessary out of love as well out of out of a genuine desire so it's kind of a question of Are We directly under the diabetes Shakti the Christians spiritual direct shelter or are we under the shelter of his automated system of Karma and the automated system of karma is
so his grace is just not his direct Grace
 is that help satisfy the court uses their Free Will and kind of wrongs me do attitudinally do I say well this is also kind of a challenge coming from the King to help me spiritually grow or do I say I'm going to wait a minute that's just that person's just abusing their Free Will and their you know like what was he at once where
 I think that just kind of circumvented the construct that I put up but I get it though but in other words the fact that this person that's coming wronged you in some way there's two possibilities of what's Happening
 1in actually there's a third there's kind of an in-between and this is an interesting what show was sure proud
I just shared this I don't know if I could find a scripture reference for it but he explained it this way he said that once we turned once we give ourselves a Christian at once we say I want to take shelter of you he says it's kind of like pulling the plug on the fan of karmic like when you pull a plug the fan is still running and are still coming from it but the generating power behind it has been disconnected and it's winding down so he said that the caramel that we receive as a devotee can be a kind of a winding down weaker and decreasing form of karma
 so that's one that's kind of what we look at in other words it it may be that I decided to take shelter Christian someone's wrong to me that could be like a remnant of karma still playing out of my life
 but for the devotee we see it all as Christmas Grace we interpreted all this crazy cuz even the law
alarm is set up by his grace so if someone's done me wrong I feel I can feel like I'm so unfortunate that I'm still operating under Chris's lock arm I haven't transcended I haven't entered into a realm of non suffering
 or we can say whatever it is it's Christians Grace you know it's it's it's a it's an opportunity for me it's not something that slipped out of his route and he has no control over it the question is is he directly involved or is he indirectly involved both are his Grace Christian says in the Gita for one who sees me everywhere and sees everything in me I never lost to him nor has he lost to me so it's really up to our vision of how we're seeing what's happening I was doing everything right I was calling the moron whacked me in the head with a baseball bat that's unfair and now this stupid guys free will
and I've experienced this firsthand my first time to India when I got very very sick great devotees came up with her I was my shoulder and said you really get in the mercy
 cuz I could have stopped please but actually that's how the great Souls see everything they just changed their vantage point it's not like this is good and this is bad this is wonderful and this is horrible the great soldiers changes their vision and they say this is Christmas Mercy guess what you got a raise you're getting a raise and we're going to Hawaii that's Chris's mercy and guess what you do your car was totaled your teenager wrecked it and he's okay with the car is mess and the insurance lapsed you're not getting you all for that car that is just destroyed
 it's Christopher C it's a training of our vision to see how can I evolve here
how can I take what the universe has given me or what my karma has given me
 and used my free will to evolve from the situation instead of diving into the the glue trap of bitterness and resentment
 and that's what it what separates the bacta from the materialist is I'm not going to sit there and the glue trap of resentment and bitterness I'm going to see this is all krishna's Divine hand and when you look at it like that and when you wear those goggles
 everything is a everything is used for your Evolution what is such a great way to live isn't it
 thank you still in case the bottom super so far everyone
 pretty amazing 500 years ago of sitting around in the future I will be 27 to get type of music that's not music manifest into all kinds of fun
until you got those who are not musically talented will be considered grain station people will pay money to see what do you mean by flinging it seems like it's full of resentment and anger is there Grace and Harmony within the dancing
 violence
 okay alright there was a little squirrel thank you stew Jim hunt
she's really doing the laundry and he's a scientist what else you got going
 give it to Mikey
 an aspiring harmonious Harmony of the next World Travel Nepal and India with bright lighter self and we are today and I'm not into all of the details it's probably not relevant and I don't want to reveal the situation right
this is an unhealthy Behavior unhealthy behavior that I see somebody that I love and I care about engaging in the unhealthy behaviors and there's a whole bunch of other stuff around that I'm not going to go into but I kind of you know I'm trying to be supportive because there's a whole other situation but I found myself becoming you know resentful judgemental critical when I'm witnessing this Behavior right and because I'm trying to be supportive I don't say anything but it's kind of you know well enough in me so I go to my six pillars of bhakti what a my tools here and you know I will not criticize I am tolerant and I really kind of have been focusing on that the tolerance thing right but you know there's this weird kind of Tolerance
Monday tolerance resentment and then it kind of occurred to me at what point am I in labeling this Behavior because I'm not I'm not saying anything about it in my you have a responsibility to act like conflict avoidance a lot of the time you know so it's sometimes it's easier for me not to say anything then to you no kind of risk you know stirring the pot so that's that's my question is is this wind is that become an able man and you know I need some help sometimes just people I just prefer not to get caught up in their karma if they got if they're going through something and then these people are so very close to me that I feel like it's important for me not to say not to be Mister empathy were you just listening and listening and they've got a whole harem
scheme that I'm supposed to just like NADA me tolerant to but often times
 I don't want to sign off on your nonsense to whatever they're going through I don't want to like this okay you're doing good sometimes it a good friend will say and what no
 and an app to put your dad just because we're tolerant and just because we don't want to criticize doesn't mean we shouldn't have discernment and a good friend will share you know Listen to I don't know if you're asking for my opinion
 cuz sometimes they're not
 but you can just you could say oh I don't agree with this but it's part of tolerance to take no offense not criticize a lot of stuff we still discern we just don't accept everything sometimes we have to step in and we have to say yeah if you if you're asking me I don't know if you want my unsolicited advice and if they say yes
what you're doing is wrong we're doing is going to harm you in the big picture I can't persuade like to express I actually care about you and want you to know that but I don't think this behavior is good behavior and then you got to think how much are they in your life are the adults and how much my meddling in other people's Affairs sometimes people have to crash and burn to learn a lesson and then I can't save everybody at the same time again I don't even want to eat you don't want to just sign off on their nonsense it's okay. It's okay.
 Not be complicit with what they say a friend doesn't always just say yeah okay okay yeah yeah I will just say no no don't don't just let them commiserate that's not friendship after while and then you are as greater Goods a good idea I think that's a really wrong idea
I can still support you love you just said it too bad a bad idea how do you jump into this you know I'm not a person like I don't have any kind of
 degree or experience or something like in relationship counseling like it's not my field or do I really unqualified and most things are you sure you're asking the right people but that that being said you know within the realm of buck yoga
 there's an etiquette in terms of relationships so like that's my field in a sense you know that's so I can approach it from that angle and you can see if it's
 if you feel it my your situation
and you do some part of the etiquette amongst Yogi's for months about to Yoga Oasis
 we try to keep criticism luggage we focus criticism especially on the self rather than on others
 there's a roll of a guru and it's a group went when when a relationship becomes to find his teacher and student
 then it becomes a teacher's responsibility to correct
 and that's accepted within the video kind of both both participants of going into the relationship with that understanding one person to come forward and say I want your correction please give me your correction and then the teacher has the freedom
 to correct
 but what if it's some of this boy for not their Guru before not their teacher but out of a sincere concern in the heart
we see this person it is creating problems for them self or problems for others and there seems to need to be some correction then how do I go about that and then then it'll save the did the care is taken in that circumstance Greatest Hits approach with is not a it's not a project casually hey you know what you know it's not like that it's it's it's says like let me be thoughtful about how best to approach this and then within the the educated about the old guy to get it then you would identify this person send these are the kind of hierarchies are Western mine's kind of particularly in the most modern current age we struggle with these kind of higher cuz what is this person my Superior or they may be equal or they might infuriate a sense they asked this is this person senior to me there different ways weed we would measure that you know one his age if they're older than me I'm really
careful about correcting someone that's my senior if they're my peer and then my friend then then there's a greater freedom for approaching if there are some of this junior to me then ideally there a little bit more open to hearing it and I'm a little bit more able to just share it so there be some in either case is going to be some care someone one might say let me reach out to the person that they do here instruction from let me find that person where they can accept that but that would be an approach like the you know from in about the yoga around let me find that person that they that they might hear this best from
 or in and maybe that's maybe that's not exactly available or something then then perhaps this
is your circumstance more more more a plea but then you might want to approach this so mean that the person has doesn't really have that kind of
 person in their life
 then you say what Rugrats was saying that if someone's not asking for your input
 then you might want to seek the permission
 you know and that might be done directly or might even be done kind of subtly but you may yeah you might come send you know I really care about you and if I share some advice with you would would that be okay with you I do I don't want to correct you I don't want to but I just care and you know like maybe some of that kind of talk would help set the
 get you both situated right we're going to need some details here I want names and but but also and even that may feel awkward and might affect a relationship
do you know you might just want to see other subtle ways that I could communicate this you know maybe there's some subtle way that I can be recognized and I talked a lot about sometimes when we have seen your people in our lives that rather than directly correct us they just kind of start to ignore us when we started to use in my life that we're doing something wrong but I won't correct them but I would go to another senior devotee who they respect and just share had this is going on you may want to say something to them just because it's just the way bhakti flows there's like an etiquette and knowledge clothes in general to right now
 is that helpful it is helpful I mean it is and you know I've kind of been mulling this around for a while because because of the resentment that I'm carrying it's not healthy for me or other people around
as well right so I'm I need to need to resolve it somehow so it is very thank you thank you thank you thank you love you guys love you I love you I think they're very close to us and they're in our lives we sometimes have to get involved in a lot of times it's like we also got to mind her own business you know what some good tools I'll let you know okay thank you for Q&A the other side of the regular
 Christian way how are you
 did they say if she's a she's a regular on the podcast of regular and she's a mom she's wife the devotee
Andrew loves her and she's a good kirtan singer to
 what's up with you how's life going wrong I was talkin early to someone and they're saying I'm going through this guess what you're all going to go through it that's what happens when you get a material body you're going to go through it and then it's going to go away then it's going to come back worse things are going good then it's the change in about to go bad Seasons so how are you I'm not the body I'm not the mind I am something to buy so when you have physical ailments or chronic pain how do you kill yourself
talk to that and like I'll be hocus in my mind but then Here Comes the Pain and then it comes to the Mind instead of feeling Divine I'm feel broken and then you know it's like that Circle the how do I stay in that but I'm not the body and try to quiet my mind to really focus on on really what we're here for and in other words when there's chronic pain it's it's it's even if we know we're not the body the mind is still prone to be to to to wallow and dwell in that like for a large percentage of the day even potentially
 for everyone who's not experiencing chronic pain is actually very healthy. Maybe some time on their hands, pants around the corner I mean now is the time there's no urgency
but it'd be very smart to get very serious about our spiritual life because chronic pain or it is something as some type of pain is a real Horner and to the degree when we're healthy we can get really focused and really locked in and really connected that's going to follow us to those winter seasons of life as well you want to hear something about the custom my thought was
 you know I don't experience chronic pain. So a but I know people that do and it's it's um
 I suppose I could say I feel for them but it honestly I feel like I don't quite know what they're going to write sometimes I get like when we were in my park at 6 or 5 days and I was just so frustrated with this I just like come on body get better and let's move on you know that I was like I feel for you but I did it
but all that being said there's something that is sinking into my awareness deeper as the years pass I think rubbing us on that path with me
 did we read so much and I love you to open it up is going to say that this is a world of suffering any Buddhist literature it's just all about right was a noble truths just like always suffer and suffering is really bad and you're going to suffer more and more it's like it's like wise thoughtful people look at this world and they understand that suffering is
 perhaps the most important feature of the realm that were moving through
 and so then it then the question becomes not it's not so much about escaping suffering yes we'll take whatever steps we can to
gate to suffering our own suffering alleviate the suffering of others especially would like to do but always within the context of understanding what is the purpose of the suffering and so that's those are the goggles that we always need to be sitting there so in one sense a person with chronic suffering
 is perhaps the most fortunate because here's the thing
 it's like we're in a cage and the doors open
 we're a little bird in there
 and we have the ability to fly out anytime we want
 but work somehow become convinced that there is enjoy me even though this cage is kind of miserable there are some nice aspects of being in this cage right there just like just enough food bird food in that cage to keep that what we don't realize is there so much bird food outside that cage is like ridiculous and make the bird food in the cages seems totally paltry and insignificant but we're thinking the
bird food in the cage is is worth not going through what it takes to get out of the cage
 we need to become convinced that it's not good to be in the cage we need to we need to understand that this world this is for the yogis thinking that this world is showing us it's it's promising us enjoyment is priming as promising as happiness and ultimately it's not true real happiness is not the happiness of this world the happiness of this world this is flickering thing that comes and goes this is not our home I so so the world is going to move in ways to help us understand that in suffering and pain is the one I want to go in some of this feeling chronic pain
 yeah I suppose one way that the one way that the person responsible since it's become more and more bitter and resentful
 but for the Diwali we have the knowledge we have the key if we have that key
then chronic pain
 this is not a prayer dear Lord that I'm praying for but practice is potentially like the greatest blessing because it's really making it difficult for you to feel this body and this world is my home it's it's now this body is a place of suffering so I suppose what I'm saying is use it turn it into your advantage rather than I did then let it Harden you in any way let it break your face in this material world is being my home my place of happiness I break it let it break it completely let allow it to thank Krishna for it and say thank you for making it so abundantly clear
 that I need to get serious about and stepping out of the cage very tough times are the catapults
people who grew up in communist Russia we know devotees from Iran where it's fully against the law and you will be imprisoned and you will be shot you just disappear for practicing bhakti in ear and or in the most Krishna conscious people
 do not Pray for Peace are paying to be God conscious and sometimes in that God Consciousness than external situations painful
 but for devoting this goes back to our first question there is no Bad Karma
 per person practicing bhakti they are just ways to accelerate your period of motion all service so when you look at it like that you're practicing bother your sincere yeah so you don't have Bad Karma any longer you're off of that field
now everything is an acceleration for purely emotional service when you look at that way what a way to frame so-called trials in this world let it let it be that don't let it be getting steeped in bitterness let it being an accelerator a trampoline while you hire in your spiritual life there is no bad karma for devotees
 I am blessed the rather not tonight this is our easy for us to say thank you very much
 I don't say it enough
 if it's all right with you as much as a Super Saiyan this and we come off like we're sitting on this throne and the sages this is the stages from the past
trickling down to the bottom of Tom we're reading it to everybody and when I say it to you guys I'm saying it to myself I'm not saying cuz I'm above it I'm over it I'm a work in progress I'm a double dented can I'm a hot mess Express so this is what I do on a regular basis to ground me to give me something to hold onto it's important for me to hear on a regular basis because my mind naturally goes right back magnetically to Maya to illusion too bad choices and it's only by hearing truth on a regular basis that we can change our thinking process
 come on now just eat just getting a pizza make sure you want to go Pizza in Vermont you find Justine what's in a pizza restaurant
your father's name is pan
 Peter Pan
 okay and so a mythological figure does he play like the little instruments used in the Greek Orthodox church sometimes you get a different names you just sort of like you do can you do cash or I go pee and we listen to the podcast no I don't know how I feel about you weirdos face and I thought
how to program she's like trying to explain all this is her I'm like I don't it could be basket-weaving I'll do whatever you're here to teach whatever you're going to teach I want to hear it and she had bought these at each and then I found you I started listening back I'm still in 2020 cuz I'm one of those people I went to the website and there happens to be the event and I'm only three and a half hours away and I was like I'll get my business is on an island and I grew up in South Ural yet so Island in Lake Champlain
 are you at Buddy's part of Vermont border of Vermont and New York is which type of boundary
 you're probably the only pizza maker out there is that
how many what's the population are there
 we control
 okay I'll people visit Victorious
 but this is really just a sandwich
 it's just bread cheese and toppings and if you're worried about you know what you can get vegan cheese on you know you
 nice bridge over here
 Italy Italy Retreat last chat it's okay so I just started every time I see Justine their face turns into a giant pizza
so what's your question
 and they talk a lot about offering and I'll do I have gotten instruction on how to offer food like there's like really good instructions around that there's a general sense of offering the fruits of Labor and the fruit of my life just to Krishna and I try to just say it in my month but is there a way Like a Prayer or something that when money comes to me or any that's just one example just give it to me
 you make it really easy by simple formula just comes to me that I can offer it back is that just a thought that I have or
that comes or is it just the sincerity or the the intention is a wonderful question question I can say one thing whenever you make well it's good to give some welcome Charlie it purifies well
 some people make some wealth in some very dirty ways to and it's nice to purify as much as possible at the same time there's other things like when you're eating food that little picture of Krishna and before you eat it you serve recognized like I didn't create this is all coming from God and you can say a prayer this official prayers but you can really it's a heartfelt prayer of love that you're offering the food back to to God before you eat it even if it's at a even if I pick up a thing of potato chips it's not like I bake the Krishna I'll just think of those potato chips just think of it
offer them I do you just said I think of Lord Vishnu and I offer them to him you would have loved these days if you were here right now these are like they are barbecue flavored Mission but yeah it's nice to think of our entire life as an offering it's nice to think of our conversations we have with friends are these going to degrade or friends or he's going to lift up our friends and so the more we get into that Consciousness our conversation our Recreation our meals the way we treat our friends the way we treat ourselves the way we treat people who don't like us this is all a type of offering we're offering everything or speech or thoughts or actions are work and there is a way to do that in the more you get into this the more you start to learn it becomes part of your life
you touched on something this is a very profound question actually it's really great there's in bhakti yoga the goal
 is that the mind is entirely absorbed
 with love and connection with God and through that one feels that love for every living being that's the goal that's what we're aiming for that's it any rule any regulation any Mantra any whatever we're doing in the practice is to bring us to that stage of consciousness
 but in all the different scriptures the different Vedic scriptures there there not a lot of people are really fully ready to understand that message and InFocus delightful as that is the goal as the exclusive Go the real the serious about the oak that had they had a focus in your mind has exclusive goal every other goal in their life
is seen in the context of that goal is kind of dumped Haled into that now there's these ancient texts the betas the four Vedas and they're there for people that aren't quite ready to understand all of that and they talk a lot about sacrifice they give all kinds of instructions about elaborate ritual to perform sacrifice the idea is that if you walk around this world with a different conception thinking that this world is really meant for my enjoyment you're really going to suffer and you're really not evolving so rather with some gratitude recognize that these gifts are coming from from another realm another level other people actually perform sacrifice as a as a demonstration of your gratitude
 and then we see that and called you in like thanks what is Thanksgiving if I understand Thanksgiving right it's like it's a Harvest Time and so look at all these gifts we received we should
some banks right and in so in The Vedic Paradigm that was laid out as perform some sort of sacrifice and along with that the ritual there's acts of Charity become very important people in the promise would be there if your charitable you'll get more in the future. Like that's that's a karmic idea
 in the bug of agita is speaking on a higher level in the bug of agita Christmas asking what you need to start thinking beyond that level of the four days and come to the level of party so the idea here is that what the Vedas were saying was like within you there's a stew ocean in this love in the selflessness
 just starting to turn that a little bit by doing sacrifice to the gods of the goddesses out of gratitude that's just it is just trying to jump-start that a little bit and I'll get you used to having some gratitude
food in in in sacrificing something selflessly or at least somewhat selflessly but really we want to take you to get your focus on the real goal and that means that your entire life is sacrificed every words that that that that every action that every thought is an offering to God every Stromboli is it not rapping that thing on your sliding it off that thing into the oven this is for you but that's the that's the that's the beautiful pure Consciousness that we're aiming for it means that it all has to be everything is off or even every thought
 but you did say you're asking if I understand correctly like in a practical way what's the best way for me to to practice at 2 a.m. 4th at 2 to go for that and you know that's it is when you bring the question down to that level of detail is when like the guru or like the guide
comes into play like Lil Let's help you understand different models of how you my best to do that because you're a person in this circumstance with these attachments in this psychology and in these external responsibilities let's lay out a plan for you where your whole life does become sacrifice but you do it in a way that that is is practical and is going to keep you moving forward rather than burn you out but push it to the Limit and didn't go just a little bit beyond the comfort zone and let's get you sacrificing you know as much as possible I'm a sacrifice two hours a day to sit and meditate I'm going to sacrifice this amount of my income I'm going to stop you know it and then you come up with a plan of how you my best to do that and ends and then they're checking in with you like how's it going is it going you not feeling good and are you able to afford how much you're giving is it creating any kind of strain on your family that's you know counterproductive now as a matter fact I could get more okay well then get more you know so like that you work out the details
I think the fact that you're focused on the principal is just really great. They aren't yeah it's a question that opens more doors for more questions and answers answer a question to break you and AJ today thanks to everybody here Alive live very fun to do this live live really great to meet everybody and hear their stories pizza parlor stories
