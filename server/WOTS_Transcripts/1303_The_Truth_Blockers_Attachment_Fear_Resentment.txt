I'm just like spreading the message of the bottom of time around so yeah if you didn't tell her to go to my Instagram account comment on it and share the video on your on your story page

 yeah I thought you were that gives you the key in the Box Recovery Group shout out at the end there did you hear that I did
 the only thing you failed to do I know I mentioned the podcast the podcast the podcast right out of the gate we just forgot to mention the name of it like say its name
oh God that was bad timing right out of the gate to start your podcast everyday I was like yes I do the unnamed podcast everyday that just a moment ago you're speaking like the master of algorithm try to hurry up I flew remembrance knowledge and forgetfulness una class when I prepare for it it just this is my way of doing it when I prepare prepare for it doesn't come out good comes up for 6 and contrived but if I just prayed right before to previous Masters and say you know what
 speak through me I've got no intelligence just talk through
and I'm French what did you do this time
 for that when I speak through me and I'm prepared to say everything so it's God's fault that you didn't mention the name and then I have to accept it
 how are you doing I slept outside yesterday Under the Stars was a little early in the season for that okay
 it was great it was a little chilly but we know we had warm sleeping bag so you wake up refreshed great trees kind of the canopy of trees it it's like it's powerful
 yeah so it's nice way to start my start my back time at the farm I got a I got a message from Luke
Carmen one of our regulars Zoomers or one of our regular others and he was like yeah I went camping yesterday with my family I want to go camping so we just hire and she just threw it was just grilling vegetables now it's like there's a hole and made a fire and everything and just put it over some logs and just she grilled me zucchinis and peppers and eggplant for the Lord first and then offer them really are you trying to instruct me in my barbecue
 our devotion for you is there also but when she she cooks for Krishna that's just the way that you wanted right cook for Christmas has its 8 for Christian the dark because of it after sun
set the alarm at 8:30 and I think there's been a lot of time eating sleeping outside this year in okay for me yeah
 alright let's keep this moving right now let's keep this moving here alright sir p.m. today and we also have brg meetings in person in Nashville and Alachua is going to be there she's going to be there doing brt meeting so if you're coming a little early that's happening it looks like people are now it's really shaping up to something really wonderful and Italy if you haven't signed up for and you want to go
 wisdom of the sage.com events but tells it all to sleep outside when we go to Italy yeah I will
yeah it's not buggy either at all I thought I was going to be buggy it wasn't busy at all now sounds so good until I didn't come out right under your eyelid like they have nothing to lose just take out his eyeball that's what they make a right under their but no is very very pleasant Michi I think it's I think I looked up the pronunciation I really have always had Nature Nature Nature Reserve Act Nicha
 the surest way to corrupt the surest way to corrupt the youth
 that's funny how he died did he lose his mind at 3
I think existentialists who cannot bear to to Smart the material world yet not smart enough to embrace the spiritual world you know what I mean when you get to Smart the whole material world is like this ridiculous I'm just crying see through the Passat but you don't have a positive alternative it's then you just say this is this is all bunch of crap now he lets see in 1889 at age 44 he suffered a collapsed and afterward a complete loss of mental faculties lost his mind with paralysis and probably vascular dementia he lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death none of his sister he died in 1900 After experiencing the monia and multiple Strokes rough
 hopefully he grew through it somehow
 you did hate God I think no no no no no no no no
I mean you're you're if you're saying that based off of the God is dead thing yeah didn't he proclaimed out his dead but he didn't Proclaim it like
 like it wasn't like an anti-god message it was almost like we've I think if you read in context you saying like we killed God like with are horrible thinking and way of living and so that you know it was almost like a lament that God is that are really going to pick up in a band that was cut into that Jesse Mounds band heart attack and I have a song to sing this song but it's all good they just did a benefit for him
 yeah I think it's just like last weekend yeah cuz he had some kind of a
some some odd kind of disease or something like that we became paralyzed joke about the score of the stuff you know we're at that age was getting tougher people are just dropping of people getting this or that as you get older the picture it's still a little dimmer healthy so what does it mean to have a say in any case say it again. A piece of God is dead and now the bottom is here and the surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike and those who think differently
 interesting is this getting towards latica the benefits of critical thinking and critical debate
 which was I think certainly did I got to ride with it what did you go I definitely that's there and I think
like princes you and I
 and the kind of the scene that we kind of came up in this was very much in this very consistent I think with the way that we were thinking right it's like it no we can't we just can't allow ourselves to just think like the common people we got to thinking different ways we got to try to see the world in different ways we got to approach it in a different way unless we hung out with a bunch of eclectic. Misfits of rancido reeks of dinosaurs yeah yeah but the way that I was relating to this particularly in relation to what we're eating right now is the spiritual viewpoint
 is actually a radically different type of thinking
 it's it's it's it's almost entirely counter the materialistic thought I mean you could say it is so where we are kind of the common person
raise with certain assumptions
 you know how I'm going to find happiness in this world is going to come through the acquisition of the things that give happiness in the things that give happiness r a b c d e n f you know and then so go out to get the the the spouse and the home check let you know and the status symbols of different sorts and since Brad Kotori you know things that are out there you have to accumulate them to be successful you're going to have to get the money to accumulate them so now you're going to need to get the right kind of occupation you pursue this informal adds up you know you get the money you get the things you get the happiness and the spiritual Viewpoint is like it entirely everything it always happen it doesn't lie outside actually lies within that's entirely different way of thinking right in the shirts way that we become corrupted is to say just think like everybody else is making you actually have to think
in a way that you have to go in one sentence completely Against the Grain completely and if we're hearing these messages and we're struggling with saying like I don't know that's going against the grain you know what
 open yourself up to see the world in a completely from a completely different angle and maybe just maybe that's the one that actually works because it seems like this other one doesn't work so well you know it did that provides going to be pushing that message you know don't be afraid to turn the whole thing upside down and see what it looks like this is what you do with like a company from what I understand from like a business like that but you know like if they have a company in the China this and I try not to let you know what we need to do with our own lives with her own thinking Shake It Off a bit common phrase of
what's my common phrase has to do makes no material sense sometimes it seems something the spiritualists are doing they don't make any sense at all to a person engage material life and people don't get it people don't get probably a lot of people listen to the show your family is like what are you doing why would you do that why would you make that choice why would you go over there why you know Yoga Retreat pilgrimage you know why would you give up you know you know a lot of people become did be got into vegetarianism veganism in there like why we cook so well you know I had a whole business of cooking me a successful business she doesn't
 yeah friends
 the hell you doing Mary I either sabotage or business it's Upstate New York who's going to who's going to eat tofu and bird seeds
I mean it's pretty clear that I wasn't asked asking for advice or opinions are going to be corrupted unsolicited advice please
 what your dad say when Papa Tony say
 for that too and he knew you know we always appreciate all of the vegetarian
 I want to hear that Billy is in the tasting right there yeah but it doesn't make with your eyes from the bottom line Financial bottom line from the you know what friends and family are thinking you know what is Ada Marin the old they should come over here every morning 5 a.m. that means you were up at it doesn't make any material sense whatsoever a lot of you guys run Zoom sitting in front of a computer for an hour every morning and makes no material sense to just maybe the answer lies and looking at it in a completely different way you know it's like the Seinfeld when were George you know his whole life is
that is a great episode the opposite of everything I want my name is George I'm unemployed I live in for the mother yeah Jose I come up and say something to her when I get to say I say the opposite of what you're going to say that is so true and it's like a lot of the things that we do just don't make any sense it's the opposite of a complete spiritual sense maybe that's your message today do the opposite opposite leopard shake it up so let's see what the
 what does that have to do with the our young friends for that a lot but we're going to find out today on the show
in a few minutes after these mantras
 rain in the Mesquite theater in Chinese means of Conquest what you do a backflip agencies to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan we see the supermoon she would be too mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and then she'll be off today at the author not stop reissue you need somebody let Sarah Riley cated and loving service to the Supreme Lord has praised the transmittal songs will be established as in a revocable backed up on Genesee Street
born darkness of ignorance my teacher to open my eyes to the torch light of knowledge after my base and sees a lot of speed you know what I take comfort in route going to take some joy in what
 that those matches we just chatted you could go back thousands of years
 you can go climb up into the hills and that Molly has and you find sages changing those exact monstrous if we go back to the same place or other places they were but let's say there's thousands of years from now yeah I'm fine people doing the exact same thing on YouTube y'all because now because you know why because I know that big in the eighties and like 1990 there was that big ma they've made my Hotbar into a cereal on TV where all of India in India at time of India would just shut down Parliament
because no one had TVs back then only like one guy would have a TV on the Block and everyone just gather around and watch them on my Bart and I think it would start with Nar I don't know they don't burn out they don't they aren't popular for a little while and then they disappear these keep going on remember we did that thing about kiss and Kiss where the band KISS was getting some kind of hologram kind of show concert thing they're doing or something like that right oh yeah and they're like now we are your much you really forget about a matter of time and nobody's ever going to think of you and your again
animals are extinct actually are not extinct they just get out of the public view sometimes these monsters will appear to destroy year and then they'll resurface like the Brahma samhita or just talk to you know becomes fashionable in the 1500s very fashionable and it started like we go underground and then she kind of box you replenished in and went crazy when worldwide in the 60s now we're having another Rebirth of bacta it's only getting bigger wave
 the only getting two people ask me all the time about what do you think it's moving forward and forward like a African bull elephant and if you know what I saw yesterday there's just can't I follow you on Instagram he's like 4 and he is not going to charge you just like I don't even understand what he's saying you speaking in my heart to hear some but I think I seen that
giving classes and it's just be at sharia's or Masters are taking birth yeah yes this is we don't even know what we started here now just all the devotees who came got very very serious about propagating the Holy Name we're just throwing out seeds into like fertile soil and some is going to maybe not grow a summer's just going to sort of take over the entire guard and there's about to be a tsunami, and let's hear a little bit of God provides radical new approach to a life in the sheriff is going to be the next ten thousand years but the next ten thousand years
 Street Outlaws the law books or in the corn
it seems like it seems like a lot of let's read this passage
 okay I think we're involved with Tom 7th cancel 7:10 a lot of time it was just a lot of grade verses 43 I believe that a correct yeah but I have to say about that you and she says yes right a living entity desires comfort for his body makes too many plans for this purpose but actually the body is the property of others what indeed the perishable body Embraces the living entity and then leaves him aside what an interesting way to look at it it's a wrap party Rehoboth this body's like a Dixie cup
don't think of some big ass fired play mug that you keep on your shelf or 40 this like a dick is a disposable plastic bottle basically just see if people did you get your disposal and it leaves the living entity aside you know there's two things here that are said here that are both like maybe ruffle the feathers or it's like when you rub the cats fur the wrong way but you just mentioned that this body is perishable and that is going to be gone quick at used to that don't don't identify with it don't make your purpose in life built around it cuz it's gone it's you know it's going to be crumpled up and tossed into the rubbish bin you just came back from you last night that they call it there and we caught a transparent
so that's one thing but the other thing was this
 it the other thing was that that actually the body is the property of others interested at it I think we actually I think even like the kind of progressive I realize that if it's necessary nowadays I'm probably always that you know just to tell children you know like they they crazy things just so that the child is protecting your body is your own and its other people. It's like you know just just as a safety measure I got that but I think we do we take it beyond that we kind of live an entire life seen your body is your own possession it's yours and nobody has a it's a it's a different way of thinking that actually
 this how about this regular Wii
there's a certain clear logic that
 because we feel through our own body that the body was ours sure likes say we always just woke you say the world worked in the way we're like you weren't only born with the body but you like born with a house and so like everyone's kind of born in like boom you're dropped into a house it would be logical to accept Okay that's rather nice house cuz he was born in that house you know in the end you were born in another house so that's your house you know but what what what about what I was going to say is actually there's not just one person born in the house is actually two people in the house because the part of Mama gets born into every single house
 right now is it is there and every single body so now there's two conscious beings not just one person experience in the Bible's to conscious beings within that body okay well now my ownership is already a question that I like how clear my
my argument is so you know my claim that this is my body already that's been clouded now but then you add to that another layer of of information that actually that other being in the house with us that other being in the body with us not only has experience in this body but actually all the ingredients were provided by that person and the design was provided by that person in the construction was done in directly under the under the direction of that person
 well now we're really questioning whether is my body to get in the right price it's just something that I was like this is like a really interesting thing to meditate upon and I think this is country out of the Christian book I think it's washing Davis speaking to come see Selina Wright please just say well actually do at one point and you know you could be and you can if there's an employer that feeds you basically gives you money
for your for your services and he owns your body he can tell you what to do or she can tell you what to do but that's what happens when we go to work right when you go to get rid of us we're not going to get any food that or or they say or the argument is that the parents actually created the body actually belongs to the parents were created by the it was given to buy material nature and therefore its of material nature and an ultimate the elements will go back into the Earth so whose body is it Anyway yes or even beginning to think like that I think for the average person so I called it I don't want to hear this stuff this body is but you know psych okay but but then understanded wear that kind of thinking get you in the long run if you actually want to break free from this cycle that you are in of I'm happy one minute I'm very depressed the next everything seems okay then it's not you know it and it's like seems like you're supposed
pain and then the pain starts to add up and then you're just looking at life like it's darker it's darker Shades Darker it's just maybe got to look at it in a completely different way will people lose their Free Will in their diet in their exercise and their self-governance a lot of times and they sort of get to the point where I like I'm going to take back control I'm going to wake up early I'm going to do some push-ups everyday I want to be a little young I'm going to do CrossFit whatever it is I'm going to get back into the some whatever it is we get into that frame of mind I feel good now I have governance there's a higher way to think and the highway to think is this is God's body and therefore I'm not going to eat healthy for me I need help you forgot I'm not going to work out for me so you check out my guns I'm going to work out because it's God's body and I'm going to take care of that cooking but not so so that's a radical
open way of seeing life but what if someone if they will hold it you're talkin about some invisible unseen God you don't have any evidence that that's why you don't have it so so you're telling me that I should live my whole life based on this idea that there's really no evidence for people I was with sages were interested in a spiritual path when we start to think like this is God's body it's a whole new way of thinking you're just saying what hey here's another option consider this and consider if this is less rational than your approach perhaps it's cuz the other approach gets you out of lethargy but it might get you out of lethargy but they could get you right back into your ego this is saying yeah I saw this on the Rich Roll podcast I said if I borrow your bicycle and I trash it what kind of friend of mine so this is going to get the body's been a gift and
take care of it not to cross that line and enter into you know check out rajakapotasana this pose I can do I grab my foot and ankle wrap it up so good at yoga is not to impress people it's actually purify the body and cleanse the body because the body is ultimately a gift and I'm born to give back with this gift try it and try it for a week try for a month thinking like that living like that it is very beautiful and therefore my thoughts are to what am I going to consume with my thoughts because this is God's the mind is like mine's not yours garage and what am I going to put it in the garage so I can put your butt in that junk in the garage or or like if you're borrowing someone's computer but like you going to all kind of like irresponsibly like going off to all kind of sites that are full of malware and stuff on it anyways I might figure
 they handle computer is like the thing hardly function anymore you know son said the mind is like that you know that you download
check the history it's a different way of thinking you know is it's a different thing but why not consider why not try one but you know what is in this is what philosophy is for right this is what you do let's think about life in different ways let's consider is this body mind you know is it really mind and if it's not then what's its best use and you know is it's not like this stuff is entirely out of left field because these messages of selflessness messages of this certain ethical messages you find them or went through all different Societies in different what you know the golden rule in all of that or are you know the Bible's teaching of what is it that it is more blessed to give than it is to receive I'd like that that's a message that's very
a system like your body is not your own right you're meant to be using it to serve others to give to others and actually that that's the more blessed
 circumstance to more blessed existence is the is the is the existence of giving thinking of oneself as a give a rather than as a receiver you are more blasts when you're thinking that way that's the stuff is out there is we're being prodded to consider it to ponder it to experiment with it you know but but but a lot and you just kind of stuck in the mud we're just kind of you know like like George needed that little prodding from from Jersey try something different approach a great and if you have time to sit and meditate just you could just think whose body is this once we start seeing herself as spiritual being in having a temporary body then it brings up a whole other thing right yeah that was from come see
boss today wasn't it I believe so I remember him or somebody else knows that and he's going to
 he's going to push it for on that on that perishable and he's going to push that end of it but he does it bluntly he's doing it bluntly you know we say this this, turn left to the next verse or two they sound pessimistic but as we said on the show before did the spirituals needs to eyes right one pessimistic pessimistic pointed towards the material world optimistic pointed towards the spiritual world I used to think all the spiritualists were just the cup is half empty material world is miserable temporary filled with suffering
 yeah it took a lot for me to get around that because I was a pretty positive person still in pretty positive
she says yes but it no we have to become cynical to the material realm we have to really fully Embrace that there is Heather's great hope that our spiritual life I'm fully convinced let's let's get the the the pessimistic cynical I pointed towards materials commentary hit it on 43 here and forget everyone desires comfort for his body and tries to make a suitable situation for this purpose for getting that the body is that the body is meant to be eaten by dogs jackals or moths moths and that's turned into useless to lashes or Earth
 good morning good morning everybody you're going to be either Butthead dog
 food for the worms
 yeah the living entity waste his time in a futile attempt to gain material possessions
for the comfort of one body or another so did I had I had one with my sheep I had a bunch of sheep but when they died
 before I could figure out what to do with the Sheep
 they were they were just destroyed that like like animals came out of the forest and I couldn't find a cheap anymore there's just a belt line that there's just a little bit of
 it goes it allows you how long did you wait
 and first comes in one across and
 they take away the first ones to cover both chairs and then the vultures get scared Away by the crows some have a crows like scare the vultures away sometimes small birds they have ways of attacking big birds that big birds can a text but they can get behind him and Polk
yeah I just poked and poke and so and then and then all of a sudden of course maggots and all these other things that you can do in a bug with a coyote eat a bear I think Bears will eat anything at bears and coyotes aren't on the dead I know what other animals, long to raccoons or roast my friend I'm right on point with this the point cuz we don't really think of our body while I'm looking to get eaten by a dog well if you die in your backyard and no one's around you will where do I know you haven't they buried in a grave you know those worms get in there eventually some animals get in there and they start eating away something something a little tiny bugs that should be your kin it now. No bugs are going to touch it cuz recovering from aldehyde what ritual that is
 who came up with that, Nate the Earth
that's really weird
 what are these makes more sense so is this body mine or is it something has gone very quickly you know something isn't meant to be used for different purpose then finding Comforts is that not only selfish and egotistical and in what is it also like
 is it also just faulty or or dubious or or you know prone to failure in achieving the goal that I'm trying to like that happened you see that the Comforts and so that's for happiness
 but does that method it because don't we see the people that actually pull the whole thing off my most would never managed to pull it until we get some, but not as much as we wanted we get some Pleasures not as much as we want but the people that go all the way
 they don't seem to be any happier
 so maybe this type of thinking just maybe you got to try this
this other type of going to selfless thinking this I'm not the center of the world that the body is not even mine that is meant to be used for higher purpose
 if you think like that extra 44 I'm going to if that's going to be really don't know now. Text pretty for you
 since the body itself is ultimately meant to become stool or arthritis everything just goes back to the earth I got to push a little limited for people to wake up what is the meaning of the paraphernalia related to the body earrings
 the second wife residences you're well your children your relatives your servants your friends or kingdoms your treasuries your animals did your ministers this is the checklist of material success exactly exactly
temporary what more can be said about this the idea here is we've invested everything in the external I'm going to have to bring it up but I binged watched on the plane the Jeffrey Epstein and he was he was a guy who just had every bit of material success in the interesting thing was cuz you was such a scoundrel and an addict he was like a card-carrying sex addicts there's a way to live a completely duplicitous Life by people who knew him we're like oh he's actually very he's very generous he's very kind he's very Like A Spoken Word chart Charming we can have this public appearance of being buried so yeah and even when he would lure these girls going to be like I really want to take care of you and your and your help you with your career and a fly you out to South Africa to go on a safari and benevolent friend but they
actually a whole second day in the action it's not cultivating and out of love of God and to be a philanthropist and be kind to people they actually have a very dark agenda and stupid fill their addiction actually and so they come off almost like a sociopath or they have this split personality in one hand and a public appearance and then they have a very very private appearance and it starts to unravel and problems of any type of addiction is you will do anything to satisfy that need even if it means I put a smiley face happy face but you'll do anything but it's really me first me first and this is the material world and this is what we're not I'm not gonna Jeffrey Epstein but to the degree that we give in to any passion in that passion controlling us it sucks us right into the me first mentality
and therefore the investment just becomes in character. Character but Persona and charm and how I can manipulate others in the material world maybe it's not maybe I'm not that Charming maybe I'll use money maybe I'll use you know servitude maybe whatever it is where I can get all my needs met and when you're going right after one of these these things that the baby could be the greatest of these warning signs for a like lust or greed or envy and you really hone in on in on one of those things you not just pick her up yourself because people like that they take themselves down to the darkest of places but everybody you touch it's like King Midas in Reverse you know you're touching and then you're contaminating it it's at a ripple effect of corruption would it wherever you go and you see that everybody people like this that have touched
 they destroy the destroy their lives these people are still
stated by him you're still going through therapy Things become like you start to think about how well I get how people who have who have a lot of power they can just get it I will this is normal I can just get whatever I wanted and you can just you can because it's the danger of Good Karma man it's the danger of Good Karma and we should just pray that
 that don't care life ever opulence that we get never forget how actually tiny we are and how we have to use everything that we have in a positive way or else yeah yeah
 so a lot of sharing here it is not it's not only like an alternative strategy in life it's a safeguard
the next exit 45 now not just an investment in the externals hear all this paraphernalia all this external stuff is very near and dear as long as the body exists but as soon as the body is destroyed all things related to the body are also finished proof therefore actually one has nothing to do with them is not interesting we have nothing to do with even in okay I get it I just have a bicycle and I don't have that same bicycle anymore where is that by saying to do it we actually but even our family members heart that's a hard one to digest because I love them I've invested love and energy and
 but we've had so many I have lifetime after lifetime different species have nothing to do with them
continue please
 anyway it's one of my stepsons I braise I loved I've nothing to do with him anymore
 I'm vested so much love and what I thought was a reciprocal of in that relationship
 and then I just have nothing to do with you just you know a kid could that Brian would just choose a 10 if and it was the most devastating thing that ever happened to me truthfully when they just decided not to communicate and I felt like so hurt and so sad and so betrayed and unless I add philosophy to this like they were never mind anyway ever even if they were born from me but end in the more helping me raise it
and it's helping me understand that it's so help me it it gave me at least a little cushion because you know where my mind wants to go on so much and when I'm finding is that the material world is designed in ways to create a healthier type of love
 like how can there be love or I'm not expecting some reciprocal transactional love can I just learn to love as where to tone your teachers going to have to be free of selfishness is going to have to believe me it was hard but I feel like I am coming to terms with it and end one of my other step son came and visited me and I was very sweet we had dinner and then we would have to shoot guns in the backyard but it was it was actually very sweet and at the same time I still can't whatever the good things happen you want to get right back into attachment
but this stuff is important because everything might turn out great and perfect with your family relationship or everything my goes so South you could get betrayed and left and then I go then but whether it's going great or you could abandoned and betrayed you don't own any of it anyway and matter fact if it's a very loving family really connect it made on it and if you're living in that illusion like this is mine this one it may only be more painful when we ultimately do give up these family unit that we don't possess at the time of death
 you know we're going to swing Christmas speaks about the sage in the bug of agita you know where their mind is that how they think how they speak how they react to the world
 and how knowledge
 is born or thrives in them
two times he mentions exact same three things that are blockers to that or that they've overcome in order to come to the stage
 what is a veto by a Raga crow that right attachment fear and anger right and I think anger we could also just kind of understand that it's like resentment
 attachment fear and in luxelet a resentment that we don't reach truth we don't become healthy until we overcome these until we are no longer controlled by these and until like you're saying here's a life test where you given you given you giving you the best with your whole heart your whole heart you you sacrifice the things that you love sometimes to raise the child and then seems like you get a pass like okay you are allowed to resent
you're allowed to utter those are those thoughts of resentment will rise in the mind and unless were trained unless we're in line unless we're taught unless we're giving another Vision another radically different way to see the world then we ended the tenants he will be to embrace those thoughts of resentment because they would we feel like they're giving they're there helping re-establish our truths that I'm a good person and insurance in so this must all be that the way to understand this is that this is all
 like a betrayal of me in my goodness and it sure makes you want to be bad o yeah you're right I do you know where as the alternative way to look at it is as these thoughts of resentment begin to approach as a rise in the mind the trained Yogi
it's not the fact that they are the thoughts Rose in their mind isn't the issue isn't the problem isn't evidence that they're not a good Yogi but what they do is they recognized him out attachments to your resentment these are the this is what's going to block my truth this is what's going to block my perception this is this is this is something that these thoughts rather than embracing to wallow in them take shelter of them I just let that I just move them along if we don't entertain that kind of thinking into it in this mine so you just going to have to move along now and it and it's like you just now you're free you're just still in that you're just like a resentment how could they expect that money for summer camp and send him the private school in your way at your heart around in that forever forever on your desk
