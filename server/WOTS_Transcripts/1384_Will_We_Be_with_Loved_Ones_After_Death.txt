call yamo Bhagavad
 live from Ramona California this is wisdom of the sages a spiritual podcast
 with your host Rocky Mouth and co-host and Senior educator from New York City customer. Welcome to the show this is episode 1384
 pretty pretty pretty good yourself on the back every showing, lawyer something in the
I'm grateful for doing this 1384 X it's at save my life during the pandemic during hard times are my break up there
 thank God thank God we buy guitar we all have to leave we all lean into something would tough life is hard so we're just saying lean into Spirit leading the truth limited knowledge and then will happen is some of it will stick and some of it you'll end up applying to your life and that's when we really get that taste for Krishna Consciousness is when we have Wyatt and it's sticks and were like wow I've got a taste for this now and slowly and slowly and slowly
 Krrish we we developed this Krishna truth absolute truth Attraction did you ever hear that story that she'll about to sit on to sarasvati Top Court oh I'm sure he told he told one story you told
make a sound like this one story tell in relation to what you just Sharon well I don't think so or maybe maybe let's let's find out what play 20 questions so he said he told the story about one man that was very sick and no matter what he ate he couldn't digest as you do the throw it up or pass it out immediately you know he is his body just couldn't process any food and I'll show me doctors are trying to help him in different ways with different ideas and different dyes and different remedies and no matter what it was the same thing
 and so then another doctor came along and he said you should eat key should like to eat that he gave me a certain amount of can you just eat don't need anything else just Kiki
 any turkey and grab you just got stronger and stronger strong it was healed and everybody turn to that. That's the last thing you know like how you going to digest a straight-up G
you know right and he said well I knew that he would eat it he would still throw up or pass it out immediately but I knew that like there'd be a coating of that you would stick to the stomach and that from just from that coating that would remain in his stomach he would get nourishment and graduate who gets stronger and be healed
 and so you said it's an analogy to describe like we here by the time we hear other Spirit to text me may think you know what I'm really not learning and I can't recall it I can't you know quoted right now I can't even fully understand it all right if you just stick with it it'll stick you know some of it's going to stick and that's going to nurse you in the more you can understand where you can be able to digest it and graduate going to become really strong and healthy from it and some breadsticks when you don't realize it till something comes up in the world now and then like a Krishna aphorism comes up some little nugget of truth comes up and manifest and you're like oh yeah
is what the body would Tom says this was the bhagavad-gita says when I first got it, just as I would go get prashad because I was broke and I would go to the little preaching center around the corner from my house in Greenwich Village Avenue X when an eight and then walked out and then some some would stick to me and some heard the bottom if you eat a book and I thought of a sort of interesting was interested in spiritual place you but I don't know it seems everything seemed a little kooky to me
 but then when I would use it as a sounding board for other people espousing their philosophy I could I'd go to different churches and different spiritualists and different religions and hear what they have to say and when you throw it against the bug of agita you're like well deposit teaches this and it would be like it became like the gold standard for truth and I was like
haven't met anything that has touched this yet so I can see how this fits in with the bhagavad-gita but still the bug of agita gives it a much broader idea of what they're talking about so it is like it's the big buckets that it's the big you know unabridged dictionary where many many pocket dictionaries you member pocket dictionaries in high school. It's like a little tiny and definitions of the same word so it's abbreviated but they need to go to in the old days we can go to the library and they have these giant dictionaries with very rice paper pages so they're both dictionary but one has so much more information in it I found at the Bhagavad Gita and the basic teachings are is like that on a break even though it's it's smaller actually Stanley 700
well I'm just saying the whole day to teach the whole thing okay is like it is like is like an unabridged encyclopedia yeah I always say I understand Christianity as a devotee of Krishna that I feel like I ever understood it before how I thought you're going to say than anybody else I understand there I feel like I get it I get I get where they're going with all this stuff
 where we going craziness I listen to Christian preachers and sometimes it will say you know well you know
 well you mean you introduced me to a man that rose from the dead and then I'll follow him you know but only Jesus did that and I was like that's not true you hear stories of yogis doing tons of ridiculous that's not why I'm following Jesus and I think if that's why you're following Jesus you got it backwards dude see what he's taught ya see what he told
cuz sometimes they pull that card out like I'll see he is a Mystic I'll follow him you know where can you meet a man who made water and she want where can you meet that man follow that man don't fall guy who makes wine appear magically put your hand in the hand of the man's never thought about that that was a Jesus song and force your hand in my hand of the man who walked on the water or something like that who spilled the water put your hand in the hand of the man I just cuz you're spilling From Galilee thank you for sharing that I didn't know that was a Christian song when you were watching someone singing it on Hee Haw when you're like 5 years all of you have no idea how hard this is the type of entertainment you okay let's go
Panamera

get it to it is so fun you just sort of like an alarm clock you got to show up for it and then the accountability
 I was starting to chatter today right now for that we have a nugget
 yeah okay here's the noticer was a from this from a guy named James surely do you know who he was surely you know I don't know who yes James surely was a an English dramatist if he belongs to the great spirit of English dramatic literature take us back like 1600s let's hear what he says about Krishna, you have to read this kind of like in your Shakespearean that I can do you want a dramatic read I can do that don't overdo it the glories of our blood and state are shadows not substantial things
there is no armor against fate death lays his icy hands on Kings
 Sceptre and Crown must tumble down and in the dust be equal made with pork rocket site and Spade that's awesome that is awesome yeah this is there seems to be a an armor all protection an impenetrable wall that the Habs have the people that have we always look at you look at people do not just being California as some people are so rich you take a note I am taking know you can't help it if you drive along Laguna Beach you see these houses in the Hills or millions of dollars each house has millions of dollars one of my client was talking about another client he's like he has houses like
play Dollars now there's people who and we thinking are mine wow that like they've got it all together they figured it out that's good real estate investment good choices good jobs had it sometimes it even seems unfathomable how they even have I even got there
 guess what forest fire Sceptre and Crown must tumble down
 no matter what strength you have wait we all get fall victim to
 Brett that disease old age
 baby it is it's coming it's coming and you can't avoid it and you can you can create a cushion with in it but the cushion is and in the dust be equal made with or crooked scythe and Spade so yeah you're like the king in the end he's on the same level as the peasant right now are the
field worker whatever you yeah
 you know you know
 the first stanza there at the glories of our blood and State
 right so that's like that's our fault she go right that's like our family our nation oh yeah I skipped right over that I didn't really like the jest that and then to their Shadows not substantial things the glory is our blood and state the things that we get proud of our family name their Shadows not substantial thinks that this is so much of our flashy just built on understanding this that that which we identify with it which means and when we say our blood you know that means our own body as well as those bodies that are related to our body you know that idea that I am this body I am a member of this family it's a shadow
 in the shadows
you know when we can say shadow we can say reflection because a virtual reality
 it means the same thing that there's a reality that it's based on you know there is no Shadow without the object that's creating the Shadow and the shadow takes on the similar shape as that substance that there's a substance or Shadow so it's Sodus Bay down to philosophy this party philosophy it's always trying to get us to say when you're in this world you have to look at it and see it as a shadow see it as a reflection see it as a virtual reality understand that not only is it in one Sense on real because like a dream it's here for a moment and then gone
 but it also indicates that there has to be a substance that's being reflected in this world try to understand that try to understand that there's something Beyond material energy that we're playing around in a virtual reality that is a
material of spiritual energy
 and try to connect with that in the in the way that we do that if we go within and we realize the self first
 and when you realize you're the self you realize I may be king today I may be peasant tomorrow I may be carrying a Sceptre today I'll be carrying a scythe and it's paid tomorrow and that's in faith does that and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it though I asked about riding we go through I thought siphon Spade was for digging your grave not believe he's saying it's Sceptre and Crown was tumbledown you're holding a Sceptre and Crown one day but that tumbles down
 and it's the it becomes equal with a site since paid you don't take a grave with a site where you don't what what's it what do you do with it you your your work in the fields so there's the king he's got the cell all you got it okay for some Shelter lyrics boyfriend
remind me to go to the real Bard now in the hands of time by Ragga not all this is called the hands would you do all the lyrics in the band yeah you did when you were when you were like working out the songs and underwrite the music but I wrote most of it did you do have the credits or is it like is it like no no I mean like you the song you want to know how the money I'm just wondering is it like like Linda McCartney kind of thing are you both on most of the song sir did you write the music to them as well well part of the such a good guitar player and I'm such a not a good guitar player even though I wrote the music he gets a percentage of
 the music to cuz he actually play the I just sort of like I can play this to do to do to do so you can cry guitar and teach it to him but
and he would get partial songwriting credit yeah how much did you give me some songs he wrote the song shall I was just wondering if like you know together as a band it did other guys doing okay they didn't write any lyrics yes you are really good until it intersects Ecology of Rocket Player control a really good all right you're not artistic and you're happy
 all of our heroes do you know the song wakanda over Heroes they were forced to go their wealth strength and glamour they were made of
where is it now profit position Prestige and name all that was valued but was it a game it seems our best refrain from all this nonsense that won't your free man you see it seems like a crime the hands of time it seems like a crime all the kings and things they thought they possessed scepters and so on grounds all the kings and things they thought they possessed As Time Ticks by they soon realized nothing could be kept even the beauty of the body not to mention the strength of the strong we were wrong it's gone so tell me to whom did it belong powering you then no doubt No Doubt
 this world right anymore songs nowadays
it's just one but more of us really this world's a mirage that you know this world's Mirage that we Embrace with our love and energy collecting and protecting all that we see but it's a sucker's bet we get upset you're going to look really feel with great heartaches and regrets and the best investment I see is something to hold on to permanently
 the hands of time but we rather not one of our most famous songs but I really like those lyrics very good very good you can't see a mirage and and see it as Like Water for instance without having first seen water at there's always a substance from which the shadow of the reflection in the virtual reality The Mirage is based on right and and world is like that then what is it based on
in the marriages are so darn real they're so real driving through the Desert Mirage looks so real it's unbelievable dreams I was saying about that saying there was another one I like the chicken yesterday my dream someone Robux that like it was unbelievable a guy in my dream who said if they don't get like that dream was so real and it was more of a mental Mirage a mental concoction
 yeah well we're going to get into that today as we enter a new chapter and Bob what time we've heard about the Bernard has been telling you to steer about the lifestyle in the practices the attitudes in following these different dharma's and we heard about all the renounces the brahmacharya is the Ivana prestas the synopsis

is it a revocable fact home again at the Met on this again open my eyes are the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet reading from the shoe mud bog of a tum
 chapter I can do 7 chapter 14 test 1 beginning Island chapter family life ever talk about ideals sometimes ideals are not that real but the side deal let's hear what they have to say starts with Mirage you to steer right these asking nor the money okay oh my Lord oh great Sage kindly explain how we were staying at home without knowledge of the goal of life may also easily attained Liberation according to the instructions of the last chapter we dealt with
this very peculiar out-of-this-world send you a sea who look like almost like a homeless not even a beggar give me the bag Darrell if he's sleeping on the streets and when you poke a little further into his psyche realize this guy is incredibly deep he's incredibly wise so now he's and any gave all these great instructions on he accept whatever comes his way he never goes out of his way he doesn't reach for anything if it comes it comes but now you just here who's actually at Natalie house while there is a king from a royal family saying okay well does that exclude us can people who have homes and families and children can they also a Time Liberation how do you do it he's going to ask me any money this question he uses his term here greehey mood hottie
 three Humboldt ID refers to the home
mudahar refers to a mule yeah or like a first time you will because I come you can be
 doll they then why do they say Mijo
 for being a kind of dumb because they said that to me will World it'll work hard all day to be given just like a little bit of grass at the end of the day but the grass is all over the place is like if you work hard all day that people don't understand this cuz no one's seen them unless you've been to India a third world country or do he never seen a meal work we only think of a meal with a guy like you know just walking around and it's some Barnyard. The mules are like basically living and or they're carrying a cart that has so much hair on it
 it's like in the tiny little mule carrying this massive cart of stuff and the guys here
it'll be all in the back with a stick is like an agrarian culture you know and then the mule is a whole thing of bricks he's caring and it's backbreaking work off and if so what is it that but the mule driver say now give me a little grass and the mules thinking not bad dealing with this I love grass he's silly mule grass is everywhere so greehey mood Hut D&D refers to one's thinking was meditation one's intelligence
 Sabrina mujaddid how how family life or home life how that stage of life where you have money you have you pursue pleasure through the body to the family too well how that can confuse when Mudah di how it can Cloud one's intelligence Cloud one stinking can
pull that are living in that circumstance can they become liberated to is it only the renunciate that's it what how should they live so the question for all of us I hope there's a good answer here. You can't you can't no more less says that that you know ultimately it all leads to Annunciation schools and they're always randomly trying to find some yoga and you any yoga school is not necessarily connected with a lineage
 they just like to do yoga in their finger while we got to start extending some old yoga books she knows to pick some random book out and it's like Summit broke on a socialism and broom on realization and they started reading it and going through it and all of a sudden or some impersonal as translation of the vedanta Sutra and they realize
none of this is practical exam romantic idea of some romantic and become one with the op Monett just like reading the book is there connection but no you can eat a whole lifestyle that adopts these teachings and stomach cut in your entire sensual experience with the world box is a way to actually live with in the world is still fine connection
 all right but as we move forward we keep in that connection okay this is text to Darin when he replied my dear King those who stay at home as householders must act to earn a livelihood and instead of trying to enjoy the results of work themselves they should offer these results to Krishna how to set up how to satisfy Christian in this life can be perfectly understood through the association of great devotees of the law
to that formula there is not a problem to live in the home but when you're there
 instead of trying to enjoy the results of your work you make your entire work your your life your family your home was it Melissa de ho Gaya remember that one right there yes if you were somehow I'm offering everything from my mind mama said dejo my body get home my home everything is an I make it all here it says Vasa Dave last day of our panel and offering of Devon today but offering under Krishna sucks shot of direct offering
 and it had how do we learn how to do that it's not if you don't this is a big one yeah I want to practice Bugsy but I'm not into those devoted I'm just going to do it on my own you can say that but again and again we hear that it's really through the association of the great devotees that you learn how to make your life an offering you do it otherwise it'll overpower you just find some devotees that you drive with
and respect the other ones even if you don't drive with them a lot of people I respect them though I got here we are most beautiful home as soon as you go in the front door you know you're supposed to look like a dining room and you know something fancy he's got this beautiful rooms it's just for the deities like if you were not a devotee of you like what the hell is this room is just a big Outlet in here and there's a bunch of Little Krishna dolls have a seat cushions on the floor is the temple room lawyer's perspective it's a misuse of space from the other two lists perspective it's a perfect use of space in the first room you see when you walk in the house it's a materialistic perspective there thinking well okay I guess you're not supposed to impress the guests yeah I guess you're not decorating their not finish decorating yet but they've been here for a few years now
and here is this a strange drum yeah that's because they're offering their dejo to Krishna the gay hoe a hoe and says well okay text three and four spiritual householder associate again and again with saintly person that's important
 with great respect he must hear the nectar of the activities of the Supreme Lord and his incarnations as these activities are described in srimad Bhagavad Tom and other piranhas want to gradually become detached from affection of his big one from his wife and children exactly like a man Awakening from a dream all right you know I explain this yes I am
 we are attached
everybody is attached once you have a family are attached but this type of attachment it should be understood that there is a weird Overly Attached almost like a sick Polly attached as if this person is my God these children will be the ultimate source of my joy and we find again and again that is not true there is some deep pleasure baby the deepest pleasure in in in your spouse and in your children but
 we also find it sometimes that the kid goes wrong the husband betrays as for the wife betrays us so there's also whenever you have so that's how you can tell it's material pleasure because there is some type of pain deeply that goes with that enjoyment
 but when we actually have spiritual Joy it's not dependent on another person it's just dependent on me and my connection my connection certain this is the only way to depend is serving the
Churchill community and someone sets there is other people involved but it's not nice or the people that I was so attached to the children that looked like like me the spouse that thinks I'm the greatest person on the planet that's a great thing to be there but it's still of this world so you can still have the spiritual household is it heavy on here but that house sold has to have a center and that sensor can be through my bottom of time that some of us may say that's part one or two is going to say well my my spouse my husband or my kids are not into this that's okay as you become into this it will affect them in a deep well and it's your duty as a household you know what I got a few verses down he's going to begin to speak about that situation. Don't think like the bottom of time okay
text rain for no no no no no. But I appreciate the way that you explain that right at this very helpful again now this word affection
 it's an interesting cuz a lot of the times you know what we're here for Sheila property and we share this before that he was trained in schools that you know what these These Old British schools back in like the turn of the century or even before the turn of the century of an obtuse not this latest turn but before that and I feel like 1890 whatever help I was in school or you know in 1905 or whatever he know he was writing using learning English in it so on and so like when we hear the word affection we generally think of like if we open up a dictionary now the first definition of be a gentle feeling of fondness or liking it so when we here
it sounds like over not allowed to have feelings of fondness for a family that's definitely not the message
 but if you look at the second definition
 and the third affection the actor process of being affected
 in other words that you get changed in contact with something or a conditioner a condition or disease and infection of the skin where the one your skin gets affected by something you're good you're like a word nerd man I like that right yeah park it for you to go back to the Victorian understanding of being this way so so so so these texts are definitely not telling us that we can't have feelings of fun is for Family actually not but what is saying is that there's a very common effect of family life and household life or one has to guard against is a very calm
a condition that one experiences were they feel as you were saying this is the source of my happened you said like they see what this person is got we got his call drama right there the source of all pleasure received my happiness my pleasure in life will this is the source of it this is the root of it this is where comes from from this house and the conference in the house from the spouse in the the feelings that I get from them from touching them from the family and the Embraces and in in in in sew on that this is where I will derive my happiness. Happiness is like a dream it's here for a moment and then poof it's gone as big again as they say like the breath of a buffalo on a cold day
 it's grossly pads ever hear a deer make that noise I don't know if I have yeah I slept outside and hear these sounds
snort snort and ends and so so that's what's being warned against hear that that we don't get an illusory affection an illusory condition from misunderstanding the nature of this relationship but he's giving also the remedy for that and that is it says shrimp Heaven by Gilberto Big Sean on the answer shree Charan Van Dam dam which means should want to hear go to the bar with time
 diction diction again and again
 hurt again and to get another words like daily like everyday but you can live in that home and have feelings of affection and fondness for your family
 and at the same time be unaffected by it not not become
these bite or condition bite or confused by the as was being discussed and Lazarus write this mood ha-di having a confused clouded awareness her intellect and the and the Cure is by here Bob, can I get now there's that little summer laundry for the commentary here in a dream we form a society of friendship and love and when we waken we see that it has ceased to exist
 similarly ones Grouse Society in other words that tangible to sign out the dream Society with a tangible ones grow Society family and love are also a dream
 and this dream will be over as soon as one dies or if not sooner therefore whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or gross way more Dream Within A Dream these dreams are all false and temporary ones real business is to understand that
one is a soul a Humber Moss me when I am spirit and that his activities should therefore be different then want to be happy
 gotten through it
 alright it's fine
 oh and this goes to what you were you were you were getting into running lights let's say that this is just a time for so many of our listeners
 question becomes very important is okay I'm here by the time everyday by listen to the podcast to reading on my own but he has been out since my husband is in my family is in where I work it's not what do I do it in and this because you know I think when you and I cut them out when you and I got into this I think our natural response in
 a common response within the December that we
4 in is how it would be
 stratum out or cut them off you know it is it yeah it was something like that we're here and something very different from Naruto who wrote the note about the sutras was this age of most the day was I mean you know this is greatest Authority in Buck to yoga he's not going to tell us to do that he's going to tell if your job is to lift them up and he's saying that you can even go along with their like if they're not incapable of fully understand that you don't have to confront it exactly and let's hear what he says it's interesting
 a working to earn his livelihood as much as necessary to maintain Body and Soul together one who's actually learn it should live in human society unattached to family Affairs although externally appearing very much attached to that you go through it all but yes I understand in the back of your mind
it's all it's all temporary you have truth running through the back that's like the back soundtrack in your mind like an ultimate I'm going to these kids are going to leave me one of us and we get along really well but one is going to die first so it's not like they're your final investment you realized my real investment it with Krishna
 if he even if people are just like I know you and your wife were both you know devotees of Lord Krishna but you can't and you assist each other on your spiritual platform on your spiritual path rather but you understand that ultimately I'm Christmas like like a lot of times and religion they think the goal is we'll just have a happy marriage that's religion or let's have a happy marriage and let's let's continue this after prayer after we die there is a really funny with Louis that show I was Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm thing and they were going to get like a second marriage
I wish I had was doing the Rouse yeah and he's like and so and we will live in peace together until we know this life and eternally and he's like wait wait a second I think maybe after a while after we die we should re-evaluate if things are going I never signed up for evaluate
 I just wanted to say that that's an idea like we want to create heaven on Earth here
 but I did is it's us and it's asking God and our partners are is assisting us on our path you know we had a question I had a question about that. The other channel you asked me about that you know because she loves her parents so much our parents are devotees cut up everything i c a r t i c v
 but she was asking about that you know I forget the exact
question but had to do with that dumb
 that idea that you know it's such a common thing you know will I be with my loved ones in the afterworlds you know what will we know each other and I think I said there's two two ways to look at 1 is that
 certainly Krishna grants that like we see we see dhruva Mirage right earlier in the fourth canto
 where he has a young boy he becomes a box of Yogi right
 and then he lives a long life as a king and then he's finally you know ready to leave this world in and be liberated and one of these
 spiritual vaikunta airplane kind of things comes down right and there's these four-handed blue-skinned aliens
message Haley and Messengers you no coming down to pick him up and I'd welcome a say what we're taking you home we're taking you out of here and you can imagine like how beautiful those beings are like just a complexions alone or just like you could stare at in beautiful faces and eyes and their jewelry is like all like it's not like they close in a way that's like Transcendence is not like anything of this world and inviting you to come onto the ship and just a sore in the Credit Unit Beyond and you'll be feeling like a free but they looked at a man in your they were flying and they looked at me and they felt like something wrong in it and and he's like well my mother now we could go back and do a story remember it was his mother that gave him his first instructions and bhakti remember that like when he got kicked off the lap of sure his father from his stepmother and his mother said don't hold any animosity towards her but this is the way this world is
transcended you have to go into the forest to bring David practice yoga so he said it you know how can I go without her and they said no not to look back and right behind him on another spaceship she was flying you know right behind them so like there was an indication that you know the Lord in the hardest for filling everyone's desires and if that's what is IRA story of a fill-in
 but I do enjoy the material realm and you'll get it you'll get those rolls maybe we'll be sisters and brothers or maybe even a pet you could be to be a pet of a person or you could be I was just talking to our friends and family that they were saying they want to a Mystic in the Mystic said yeah your daughter is here was your mother and you could say that my daughter has she's like a mother
always like an old lady since he was a little kid he's been instructing me and trying to correct me all the time yeah it's like you just switching roles but even beyond that there's the idea that we have special affection the other kind of fiction the fondness right yeah for our family members and that's a very natural thing you know it's a very obviously very common and a natural feeling or emotion and so we think that
 life beyond this world wouldn't be complete for me if they weren't there
 you know I can't imagine breaking that that is if the relationship were broken how could I feel happiness if that relationship I was thinking the other day I was like I wonder if it has to be related like another birth
 okay I'm working on so I hear that
thought to mention I will I be happy if this relationship that's giving me the deepest happiness in life if it's broken how will I be happy without it
 Anna and I you know I shared that it's something like that Jello in the in the prison kind of thing like you know okay we're ready to let you out of the prison
 do they have the jello out there
 what's your location to the last thing you need to think about is that you're a dude my all of these years in a prison this has been my only happiness is jello if I'm going to leave the prison is that y'all going to be out there right I don't worry about the jello man is going to be so and so so the ideas we have special affection for certain were born into a family we have special affection for these these people that I love that show no affection and kindness and you don't care
the fact is that that relationship was just going out for a blip in time before that you were in another family and their other beings that identified you as their families and they were showing you special care and before that there's another group of people in the fact is is that ultimately you know they call it a family tree you know like it kind of branches out and you feel a special connection to people on your tree but the fact is that we're all part of a big tree that is in the root of it all is Krishna and so
 in our enlightened awareness
 we feel that similar kind of fashion look for every living thing
