 8 copies by one two three copies it's it's you know what it's sankertown it's giving spiritual truths to people of the world
 it's getting to the Nugget Revenue positive direction
 yeah when we have here today we're going to
read it or you read it because my phone is charging somewhere okay I got a lot of information on this this we went from Pablo Escobar the cocaine bear and we moved to Gandhi sometimes it's been called
 it's been called the seven social sins
 and it's also been called a seven blunders of the world that lead to Violence by Gandhi
 but what would I tell Richard he's not the originator of it this list we're going to read you a list of what you want to call him social sins are blunders
 that Gandhi listed in a newspaper called yummy India that was his newspaper has his weekly newspaper called young Indian
October of 1925 but an almost identical lists have been published six months earlier in England in a sermon at Westminster Abbey by Frederick Louis Donaldson
 and so Gandhi wrote that a correspondent who called a fair friend that sent the list are they wanted readers of young and you to know if they do not already the following seven social sins and Gandhi also naturally the friend is not want the readers to know these things merely through the intellect to know them through the heart so as to avoid them okay I thought they served some interesting things worth discussing so it's a list of all of seven first one is this well
 without work
 you want something for nothing that's probably sounds I probably just don't gamble yeah I can see a
like or principles are freedom of the Ford regular principles or power pods I don't think they were written down anywhere and I'll come out there and talk with him know I don't think I don't think they're in the where are they in the body what time is dealing with the with collie
 all there
 tell there I guess you're right just with those up
 all related I stand corrected okay but you know what let's read them quickly and then lets go and discuss them marry them quickly okay yeah we can talk about it so there's wealth without work there's pleasure without conscience
 knowledge without character
Commerce without morality
 science without Humanity
 beauty without brains religion without sacrifice
 and politics without principle
 I looked up the definition of each one of those things that it was without like look up the definition of conscience Look up the definition of characters homework perhaps is the one that we needed the definition least activity involving mental and physical done in order to achieve a purpose or result if you get well you know who I was thinking of Warren Buffett
 I was thinking about Investors you know I know and then that has a small thing but he's like limited the money that he gives
who is yuno to his relatives in its in their inheritance
 but you know I saw something that he wrote or he was being an ass he said people ask me where they should go to work
 or should I get a job or should I work and he says I always tell them to go to work to whom they admire the most he said I have I have urged people to seek employment in one the field
 and two with the kind of people that they were selected they had no need for money
 I like that I like that a lot and I kind of try to do that with my own life you know but well so that work that was the first one you know the second one was pleasure without conscience
 how would you define conscience in this context at work I think that's worth even teasing out so let's talk about that wealth with that work or does that mean just like investing
inherited wealth that is potential what was the title of these things that are problematic
 connecting to the problematic one was there call the seven social sins social or the another I don't know if it came from Gandhi but that is 7 blonders I don't think it's a sin to inherit money it's just what you do with that money there's people that inherit money in there and a parent thing so let's say you got the wealth you should still work
 you know it's there not working that's the sin I think is that what he's talking about Nina okay like like gambling
 will it be in Austin gambling I don't want to go to back to Tim Horton of yesterday then the cocaine guy
you know but but there is something to
 not chasing like we think wealth is the key to happiness and we think work is like it drains us of Happiness try to avoid work different people try to but actually know when you find work that's filling it's very satisfied and in a very healthy way so there's something about not needing too much not wanting too much and and there is something about a good work work ethic which tends to be a healthy thing for people who do you find the work with a service that you want to do that you have it again is Warren Buffett and the field
 and are the kind of people that you would select if you had if you had if I had no need for money but I said I still want to work what would I do and then going to try to do that for a living you know and it maybe you don't make as much money as you might make another field
but hopefully you make enough you know and it and you feel good waking up every morning going to work you know Bruce Springsteen speaking about this he talked about like he is both his parents and their relationship with the work that they did in life and he saw like his father just like his work was just drudgery
 and it it was in his working in in the United some Factory or something like that yeah. Kuhlmeier but but it was kind of like it was he dreaded going to work everyday in his mother his mother kind of like to put on some nice clothes and go and work to it it kind of gave her some purpose and some meaning you know she had took pride in her work
 but I think if if we're not so worried about making lots of money but trying to do something that we feel is Meaningful and satisfying
then we can be happy simply no need to talk a lot about that but there's quite a few here pleasure without conscience this is what do you what do you think how would you define consciousness conscious like guilt-free pleasure I want to enjoy at anybody else's expense that's what I say how would you define the word conscience
 conscience means a concept of this is problematic this is a good thing or this is a bad thing an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's Behavior sure if I'm seeking pleasure with it maybe the pleasure I want I need to erase the conscience in order to experience the pleasure that's a problem right right A lot of people try to do that they feel like the conscience is something that is just social and as I dropped it
spell inherited from some Dogma from the Catholic church or the Jewish background but I think there is something in there probably is some idea of ethics and Regulation and self-control inherited from a judeo Christian background for the same time there also is a feeling of worthiness when you behave in a worthy way and it's not just subjective there are things like regulating the the desires of the body in the regulating the senses regulating the mind-controlling the moment these actually give a feeling of worth
 yeah ours are Pleasures if if the if our Consciousness is being triggered
 by when we enjoy pleasure then we can either save we could either say let me learn to find pleasure in a way that my conscience doesn't have a problem with short or we can say let me eliminate the conscience that's the problem in and I might try to justify that array
no eyes at all kind of ways
 sure if he will do it I think that's sort of you like your friend what's-his-name with Church of Satan guy in the Church of Satan is all about that okay then knowledge without character is the definition of character the mental or moral qualities to distinctive to an individual or strength and originality in a person's nature or a person's good reputation
 okay but knowledge without character
 like we learn so many things but are we being trained and character along with that parallel right so we tend to focus on you know when we go to school we learn how to make wealth so that we can go out and see pleasure and we get knowledge you know for the same purpose but are we being trained in
conch City character it just like unbridled I'd like I like the concept of capitalism but unbridled capitalism can be like knowledge without character you know you do I'm going with that or pleasure without conscience
 you know you know there's a tension between capitalism and Socialism or communism whatever the point is whether it's a government can exploit people or corporations can become as powerful as governments and exploit people you know how to make sure that not that we aren't exploited by either
 okay then Commerce without morality
 Commerce making money you know the Earth right now we're digging were plowing
we're doing open pit mining trommel children mine for our cell phone batteries for for Cobalt in for an electric car for children. Your electric car now yes it is in one send a text when it's saving oil it's my electric car and one since that is the weakness of capitalism yeah there's there's there's no adult in the room that's going to say hey we're heading down a bad path here so like you know whether we're destroying the Earth or whatever maybe if there's more money to be made that becomes the highest principle
 Commerce without morality science without Humanity I mean she's
 you know what today is
 have you seen that yet well I was
but virtual reality with them and they can walk around the street with them on I'm seeing glasses and like eyeglasses that are you can talk on the phone and I remember I remember when I first moved to New York that's how I know and have the iPhone 3 I just got an iPhone is iPhone 3 do you know what is your first iPhone was your first number to iPhone and I have no idea come on I have absolutely zero idea phone you'll know what you have now I want to see everybody's first iPhone my first was iPhone through it went from the Blackberry to an iPhone and I was like this thing is amazing and you know any headphones you walked around the iPhone Timothy Tucker at 3 too so I'm walking around that iPhone
walking around and everybody is it was like the first time because I live you know I was living Upstate New York instead of walk to the city and everyone's got their face in their phone it was it was shocking that all New York was walking around the face in the phone and now kids face in the phone adults face in the phone I cannot face my phone talk to me about that and anyway it's going to be now we're wearing goggles and glasses it's like
 what could the dystopian reality is were in it
 science with a human
 you know you know with the anyway we can talk about all these things forever you know that the whole chat GPT and anything that you're reading now you don't know if was written by human or not anything any image that you're looking at you don't know cuz I don't even know if that's you right now this could be a
you and me they can do that I didn't say things cuz she would say
 okay then 6 is really bad with something where it's not even us that betrayal and see if we can fool people
 okay the next one was religion without sacrifice which I think that's it you know honestly
 as much as I think there's such beauty in Christianity I think I'd like practically the whole church just got infected with this idea
 that the sacrifice is all done by Jesus
 that's interesting and then that you're not supposed to sacrifice yourself because you're a sinner by Nature anyway we'll see if Alyssa Sachs we don't take drugs in there like what Alice Christ was the only sinless person you'll never be sinless your broken your air filter
you just got a stranger to crash Chrysler's die for your sins so that's really that connects has so much to do with what we sacrifice how we sacrifice our time I would sacrifice her body how we sacrifice our words how we sacrifice our mind how would we give what we give up you know otherwise that religion has become some kind of vehicle Ferrara
 yeah the regions in division and Salon
 oh yeah anyway that's sweet
 and I thank you thank you I appreciate this list I think it's I want to take it and look in my own life you know please do my own life and see how how I can
 how where we engage with these different things are to be wild pleasure knowledge, science religion
politics
 how and I are in any of those fields are thought or words or behaviour can become enriched with these other
 ingredients you know again work conscience character
 morality Humanity sacrificing principle
 listen to think about some the door jamb material before starting to see what about what time we start a conquest when should offer sabbatical the bass and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan a mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and just really off today of the author not stop radiation about race Unity

 material desire immortality
 text 18
 I've been very much astonished to see your endurance in spite of being eaten and bitten by all kinds of worms and ants you are keeping your life are circulating within your bones Surly this is quite wonderful even saintly persons like bhrigu born previously could not perform such severe austerities nor will anyone in the future be able to do so who was in the three worlds can sit in his life without even drinking water for one hundred
Celestial years this weird people still doing this stuff people are doing weird austerities an Indian guys like walking with her hand in the air and see those guys
 I don't know yeah I mean that's usually standing around more than walking I think but yeah yeah but they're just got one arm in the air it's like skinny
 I don't know what they're supposed to get from that
 I think I've shared with my thoughts on that before what will the way that I understand that from yoga perspective and you don't it again this is something that's going to like take Savannah keep their hand up in the air for 15 years or some of that they don't bring it down to you want to go to sleep they tied up it has to do with it again if I understand it correctly so we could call this person that are puffy right someone who's performing some kind of yogurt to pass yes I'm kind of yoga poses. But you know as all yoga
 Israel
to mind so my understanding that is through one accident faience
 one shows the mine who's in control right cuz the mind is going to sleep with the arm down you crazy put it down put it down or not going to do it so I'm not given the Mind any I'd rather choose cold showers
 Siddiqui is the mother of the demons and Aditi is the mother of the demigods my dear son of DT with your great determination and austerity you have done what was impossible even for great silly persons and US I've certainly been conquered by you
 oh best of the Demons for this reason I'm not prepared to give you all benedictions according to your desire I belong to the celestial world of demigods who do not die like human being
therefore although you are subject to death your audience with me will not go in vain here's a question for you is hard to catch tapu a demon or I mean I'm sorry I'm a human or is he a rough Shasha or are some rushes humans
 directions to humans or are they a whole different screen humanoid
 she would know I was just lost in space when they have a body like a human you don't know I'd be more powerful than what we think of when we think of humans
 sweetheart and Mooney continued after speaking these words for any cuz she poo Lord Vermont the original
 after seeing these words to hiranyakashipu
 you with us
a sentence with therefore although you are subject to death your audience will not with you already know, you will not go in vain I read that she continued after speaking these words to her any country pool or Vermont the original being of this universe who is extremely powerful sprinkled Transit Dental infallible spiritual water from is coming down brown with his little water pot upon hiranyakashipu his body which had been eaten Away by ants and moths disgusting enliven to run the cashew Pooh
 I think he got the body back. Just going to get a body better than before much better than before
 as soon as he was sprinkled with water for more per month water pot will Rose and down with a full body with limbs so strong
bear the Striking of a thunderbolt
 with physical strength and bodily lust resembling molten gold he emerged from the and he'll it completely young man as fire Springs from fuel wood
 sing Lord for my present before in the sky Harry by his Swan airplane running if he was extremely pleased he immediately fell flat with his head on the ground and began to express the obligation to the Lord so he's being pretty religious here is bowing down to order mom and getting up from the ground and seeing Laura Berman before him the head of the Demons was overwhelmed by tribulation with tears in his eyes his whole body shivering he began praying and humble mood with folded hands and faltering voice to satisfy Lord Vermont
 now he's going to be a very interesting let me offer my respectful of basin season 2 The Supreme Lord within this universe
at the end of each day of his life the universe is fully covered with dense darkness by the influence of time and then again during the next day that selfie fulgent Lord by Zona fulgent manifest maintains and destroys the entire Cosmic manifestation through the material energy which is invested with the three modes of material nature he is the shelter of those modes of nature sattva Guna Rodger Guna and time ago. She's not offering
 I offer obeisance used to the original it's interesting though he's still accept a higher power you know he's yeah but I think in the sense that he's saying you've got something but I could get it to write this interesting yeah that's not our philosophy where you want to actually just take
the position we like to be Servants of of higher Powers teachers forefathers cetera
 hope that he wants the position of Brahma bases huge to the original person out of the universal or Burma who's cutting this scent and you can apply his mind and realized intelligence in creating this Cosmic manifestation it is because of his activities that everything within the universe is visible he is there for the cause of all manifestations your lordship being the origin of the life of this material world is that your lordship being the origin of the life of this material world is the master and controller of the living entities moving and stationary and you inspire their Consciousness you maintain the mind and the acting and knowledge acquiring sent this and therefore you are the great controller of all material elements their quality
and you are the control of all desires my dear Lord by your form as the baddest personified
 damn through knowledge relating to the activities of the youngest brahmins you spread The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of all of the seven kinds of sacrifices headed by Agnee stoma indeed you inspire the youngest Brahman has to perform the ritual mentioned in the three Vedas being the Supreme Soul the Supreme of all living entities you are beginning lists and lists and omniscient beyond the limits of time and space oh my lord your lordship is eternally awake seeing everything that happens as Eternal time you reduce the duration of life for all of the entities through your different parts such as moments seconds minutes and hours
 nonetheless you are unchanged resting one place as the Super Soul witness the
witness and supreme Lord the birth list all-pervading controller who is the cause of life for all living entities
 biggest Brahma is the cause of life for all living entities that provide mentions in his commentaries to Sony's horsey says Lord vermaas the original excuse me look for Mazda look Christians original creator
 and Lord vermaas original engineer
 right so show her any cash until he can recognize vermaas power or what he refused to recognize is that it's all coming from Vishnu yeah I just want to give ultimate respect that there is this being that's entirely Superior on and you know eternally Anand on a superior level that that is this is that everything he has
 is provided for by you know
and even and still was so powerful as to be able to kill his brother right so there's that divisional killed his brother
 so he's willing to see to recognize vermaas unique power and is like and I'm going to get that power to my austerities to just like her mom did it I can do it
 any can glorify him
 but what he can't do saying there is some other being out there that I'm depending on that is that that is categorically Superior to myself I can accept that you Donuts
 I think the part of the nature of this historic mentality
 text 32 there is nothing separate from you whether it be whether it be better or lower stationary or moving the knowledge derived from The Vedic scripture but you punish odds
and from all the sub limbs of the original B acknowledge form your external body you are her run you run your garbage the reservoir the universe but nonetheless being situated as the Supreme controller you are Transit Dental to the material world which consists of three mode material nature oh my Lord being changes slowly situated in your own Abode you expand your Universal form with this Cosmic manifestation the spearing to taste the material world you are bermont the super-soul the oldest the personality of God has let me offer my respect little Basin season to you who is who in his unlimited unmanifested form has expanded the cosmic manifestation the form of the totality of the universe he possesses external and internal energies in the mix energy called the marginal potency which consists of all the living entities
oh my Lord oh best of the givers of benediction if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire please let me not meet death from any of the living entities you entities created by you okay so here comes is his plea for immortality
 in a very specific way because I think we go back to a mama said to a mama right when he was speaking said you know right when he wrapped up his message he mentioned something about
 what was it that he said he's he said something you know in relation to his not being able to give him immortality
 and so nice and let me see them
 cuz I'm there for you okay said I belonged to the celestial world of demigods who do not die like human beings
for although you are subject to death
 your audience with me will not go today someone give you benedictions but you are subject to death and hearing that hernia cause Pooh's going to try to say well let me know maybe there's a way that I can get around that and so he's going to ask tricky way he's going to still try to get immortality
 it's a really nice person once he said I don't want to please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you that's the first
 let me a sample of a Cici's on to the Supreme who is unlimited unmanifested for a benediction if you will kindly grant me the benediction by desire please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you it was pretty good one
clever
 grant me that I not die with any residents within or outside any residents tend to cover his bases
 during the daytime and not during the night time either
 nor I don't to be killed in the garage on the ground or in the sky it is want to die on the ground or in the sky even tried to kill him alone can be sort of like save you a lot of water in a car accident in the water grant me that my death not be brought by any being other than those created by you nor by any weapon nor by any human being or animal
 what does that mean grab me that my death not be brought by any being other than those created by you
said I don't want to be killed by any being that you created I don't want to be killed by any being that you didn't create okay I don't want to die another piranha it says I don't want to die on any month
 and I think he was killed in a result of months
 put that in your trivia book a cruise shuttle Monticelli much later in the year
 anyway this grab me that I might where did you read that right what where do I hear it
 you leaving now
 Grammy that I may not meet death from
any entity living or nonliving let me further that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets is covering all the bases there
 since no one can kill you in the battlefield you have no competitor
 therefore grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival give me so lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities and give me all the glory is obtained by that position furthermore give me all the Mystic Powers obtained by longest Saturdays and by the practice of yoga for these cannot be lost at any time wow
 all that effort
 with a very specific desire of immortality
 I'm not measuring that at all what I what I imagine is just how fruitless this whole endeavor
it's in route but yeah but it's lost and so in the end it's fruitless well there's no protection in the material world there's no there is no sweet for you in the material world he was even at the best of the sweetest fruits
 it sucks it all becomes tasteless after some time all that he just said it shows that he has an understanding he has some kind of understanding about how the universe is structured and how it works how the laws work how the systems work
 any luck at all and he said let me get a round rather than work with it work in harmony with it you said let me get around it
 Nightcore any story found a way around it and for a long time it seemed like
beat the system
 what's not like he's just some foolish materialist and work hard to make some money that I quite enjoy it he understands that the Universe provides if the worship certain beings to get some results he understands like this power and from Power gain some strength but I have to do things in such a way that my strength become an unbeatable it almost seems like he beat the system almost there is no beating the system you can smell the system in the material world yeah so he's so I can find my way to my office to the power of my austerities and through the benedictions of the Dave us I can take a position and once I've got that position I'm in control All crew I recreate the boss
 I manipulate everything and in and out and I'll beat the system when were you founded
actually he had never beaten the system he just kind of like he he's arrived in a sense he thrived in the system for some time
 even then was he happy and I like you know what he had all that his son was getting an angry his son's teachers are getting am angry you know he was about Howard Hughes and his whole story and how he just became he was so wealthy and he just became in in that you don't have any abscessed with protection and try to keep himself safe and he was like a German called super germaphobe and he ended up if you get to a certain point where you lose your mind cuz you can't beat Death no matter what you do to protect yourself
 so so what when it's it seemed as though he had beat the system but really you know time is just taking away and it was just a matter of time before his is
is artificial world collapses
 all that sacrifice all that austerity if it were engaged not too to get around the system or the beat the system but applied within the system
 he could have transcended the system you know he could have transcended it
 do the effort they put in
 are you sick serious
 it it makes you analyze what are we working so hard for where we going with all of our hard work with our Endeavor what we working for what's the plan what's the bigger picture of our life is it to this is what is the point here to save as much money so we can retire that the goal is it to travel a lot of touch our foot on every continent is it to live life filled with Adventure is that the
it is your face a good family is that the goal is it just like we're all going to die to enjoy as much as you can is that the goal is sort of like we're made to hear these stories and so to re-calibrate our intelligence
 her any cash you put whatever you got her any ketchup who's got more
 and you think you're doing pretty good in the material world or any cash up who's got better he's done it better than we have you know if we go back to Gandhi's things
 in one sense those are each one of them is a type of warning like don't try to beat the system right yes you can have pleasure but you can't have it without conscience yes you can have Commerce but you can't have it without morality or you will degrade yourself you know and suffer because of it you know yes you can have signs but it has to be bounced of humanity you know
 in one sense I see those is each each one is kind of like that anything you want to say don't
try to beat the system the system if you try to beat the system the system will beat you but if you learn to move with the system if you learn to benefit from the system
 then you can actually try and send it you can you can break you know you can actually break through it it's it's funny because
 hiranyakashipu his austerity was unparalleled
 and within the universe it appeared his power was unparalleled
 what we see is that is that is he was convinced this no one more powerful than me
 and then we saw just how that just how it that was a complete illusion that that is power Stephanie and end in comparison to that eviction and at the same time we hear that that the the
the harmonious attitude in other words the attitude of loved the attitude of devotion that attitude that is in harmony with the laws of the universe that the attitude that is cultivated by working in harmony with the universal laws ultimately in there that if you know in the in the highest loss of divine love that the person that possesses that love
 in the heart
 actually conquerors Christian who is unconquerable right actually you become more powerful than God but only two different type of power
 it's power love power love power love when you love somebody they'll do anything for you you before I kill somebody
 that's why they say that it is suit or lava is
difficult to achieve. Emotional service take this party to Miss Mara who's been very expertly taking notes I have to take out the people you want to work with and said of the wealthy want to learn
 a story about that but I don't think we got time for cocaine
 find pleasure that your conscious doesn't have a problem with
 behave
 okay where the activities please there better ways to conquer the mine and keeping your hand raised for 15 years that is
play this probably better man there's better ways that you know that help you when you swim is hard if you were doing that you couldn't swim he's at the swim with you. I mean how many things you can't do with that arm in the air
 recognize the Supreme Source behind brahmas power and whenever you're in a group of people think people are thinking I know you want these got a question what would you like to stand up don't call him that I could anybody like to help me with the dishes tonight
 there's no protection in the material world
