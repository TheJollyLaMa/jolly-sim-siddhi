 he can't hear that kind yet but anyway they all said Harry Bell really loud are microphones I don't think picks up external sound but we had a really great great day yesterday something about just going out there and working and being
something bigger and coming together and eating for Shaw I didn't have a time it's just like it's just a formula for peace and joy and connection when we got a bunch of great people here with us a lot of our regulars in a turkey a lot of our locals have a good day yesterday
 how are you guys doing yes it is a devious kitchen
 I bumped into Tracy Conway the husband's old school before the podcast they usually come on our Sable weekends seems like their plan a date and they said they were busy okay
 very nice to see her so if you're new to the show welcome it's Sunday we do Cuban a question
the answers today I'm so people right in their questions but when we have programs at the farm or were out with or without the pilgrimage or something sometimes you like to ask are people from that Retreat or build a bench or whatever to come up there all questions and bring them on WE introduce them to the crab because it's nice this is how we have developed Community to get to know each other and sometimes we have disposed of the sages Retreat and they're like oh my God you're Linda Linda Linda oh my God your car got that right off any other announcements Mara I went back to your knees at 9:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. and where it shows on at 7 a.m. this week and happy birthday to me happy birthday to my sister birthday today on Mother's Day happy birthday happy birthday happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there

 live from Boston there's a step as you can tell us where the hardcore guy
the hardcore guy with a heart of gold she got to put your face right on that microphone and what's your story again here give a brief update of your life coming to spirituality it was I was a mess and I was in pain and that's a perfect translation of like the classical way a person comes to Berkeley right like even the great to Swami's and it when they come for it and they say
 who am I I don't understand how I lost like that I
 yeah I remember your first Retreat here
 you never even went to Yoga Retreat or anything it was just share those like yeah
freaked out and I was expecting I was honestly I was supposed to come with my fiance we like I reserved like the private room so that we didn't have to associate with anybody if we didn't want to she ended up having to leave at the like my dog got sick and and so was just me and I was like I told her I was like I'm probably going to pull the ripcord best and leave and just leave if they won't miss me so I'm and that that's honestly what I was expecting are they expected to just for her to be weirded out and I said this a lot of times in my association with especially with the community and ice age group I fell in love with devotees and that's really what is my biggest inspiration here also fell in love with chanting but devotees in association with devotees has been just a constant source of
inspiration for me and I'm really really deep in by appreciation for the practice and so they kept me engaged is like just even though I had some struggles with a little bit with some of the concepts because like some of the stuff is like sort of really out there especially coming from like a like a western perspective I'm like if these people if this is the results of this really can't be that bad so I'm just going to hang around it what do I do what do I do anyway that's a great conclusion great hanging out with him and he's a wealth of farm information helps us a lot of the four I really appreciate all of his contributions what your question today I have it pulled up and course I lost it. 1 second sorry
 can you pull the swapping yeah it is a floppy Mike you got the floppy one today
I don't think he's freaked out by us anymore
 but who among the crowd is exam I had come across as like last week his I sometimes God but I have friends that ask me questions about this all the time now because like a man I chance and you know I come to these retrieve some of the podcast is a is a regular thing so I'm going to votee but so I have friends that ask me questions about this a lot and so you know sort of pushed back on some stuff and it's pretty easy for me to explain that like all of the good things that are in life like parental love maternal parental love romantic love those are a reflection of the spiritual world
they come from somewhere right now but I'm coming across that like I came sort of came to me last week and I've never been pushed back on this but like what about bad stuff like where does like things if those things are a reflection of the spiritual world and they sort of ultimately emanate from Krishna and where do things like I hate and jealousy in different come from or even crazier things kidnapping how is kidnapping reflection of the spiritual world or you know beating up innocent people or bombing how is that a reflection of the spiritual world as tuba that but I think those fit into Hey Jealousy uncomfortable to be unaware
 you like me to start rubbing your place so this
Jamie that's a such an important question is kind of a very fundamental question it's an accent is kind of the big question of like where does evil in the world come from but you're putting in this context of stuff that we've been sharing on the podcast from the vaishnava from the bucket perspective and so you know they're different analogies different metaphors that are used you're talkin about reflection we've been speaking about like this world in a sense is reflection
 another one that's used a lot of Shadow and so in the shadow is kind of the same thing as reflection ready to get the outline it's just kind of let's put it this way let's let's work with the shadow idea for a bit
 in a sense your questions like asking where do Shadows originated from what is all that dark stuff and I hate jealousy and difference in one since that's the shadow that's the dark stuff where do Shadows come from
originate with light but it's when something gets between the light and the object that the light is shining on that you got a shadow
 and so the way that even bother Tom right you know there's four verses to call the chapter slow q44 versus Obama time they come in the second canto
 nothing's 9th chapter your second second chance or 9th chapter this is really just given and it's very condensed form how do understand this but think of it like this if God is light cuz it wants answers everything is coming from God so this world is reflection you know a reflection is light right it's like light on a particular surface but that's coming in a coming from a source but if God is light
 and then there's this world
categories this God there's this world and then there's us
 in fit in in the 15 chapter the Gita Krishna lays all this out you know. This is what knowledge is understanding these three categories
 so when
 if you had God think of God like the sun almost
 and then think of this world and think of us holding that world as if it's like a basketball in the light of the sun right then there's no Shadow on that world
 but if we turn around and we get ourselves in between God in the world
 now there's a shadow on the world right now there's a shadow now there's a Darkness created
 and so that's kind of how we understand that it's not it's not coming from God to evil things in the world they hate the jealousy and the things that you were speaking of
 this world is
it is a reflection of the spiritual realm in the spiritual realm is perfect harmony
 but the more that we get in between this world and God do or you could say the more that we see this world as separate from it what is it that actually gets in between is that exactly us
 but it's are seeing as our seeing this world
 as Meant For Us
 this idea that this world is mine this world is meant for I this world is meant for my pleasure that is us getting between God's material energy and God
 if the if we weren't involved then they were just be God in the world and everything would be bright
 but we say no let me get in between or week sometimes it said turning our back on God like the Earth
 if you have like the Eastern Hemisphere and the Eastern hemisphere is facing
Saint Denis all lit up there's no Darkness but when it turns its back
 now becomes dark so it's what you do all these kind of analogies are playing with the same idea but to the extent that we see this world is God's energy meant for his pleasure to that extent it resembles the spiritual World in that Harmony is there and to the extent that we see it as mine for my pleasure to that extent the world becomes dark and we see these dark things like hatred and jealousy and anger and so on that verse from the Bible time
 from from the checkers low-key so important
 it's Christmas speaking to its bishnu speaking to Lord Brahma
 and he says whatever appears to be of any value if it is without relation to me if it is seen without relation to me you can say it has no reality know it as
illusory energy that reflection which appears to be in darkness and there's a Long, Tall or charges give long important commentaries on this but let's just read the first paragraph of what propert says and discuss the essence of it he says
 in the previous verse is already been concluded that it at any stage of the cosmic manifestation its appearance its sustenance is growth its interactions with different to energies it's deterioration and its disappearance at the world goes to these Cycles
 all has its basic relation with the existence of the personality of godhead
 and as such Whenever there is forgetfulness of this Prime relation with the Lord
 and whenever things are accepted as real without being related to the Lord that conception is called a product of the illusory energy of the Lord because nothing can exist without the Lord it should be known
at the illusory energy is also an energy the Lord the right conclusion here comes the answer the right conclusion of dovetailing everything in relation with the Lord is called yogamaya or the energy of Union
 and the wrong conception of detaching a thing from its relationship with the Lord is called the Lord's and I view my or my mom Maya both the Meijer also have connections with the Lord because nothing can exist without being related to him as such the wrong conception of detaching relationships from the Lord is not false but illusory
 and so again it's not that everything in one sense if we go back to your question the parental love for the romantic love
 those are also
 illusory
 but
the less selfishness is in it the more resembles a spiritual so probably said the love of the mother for the child is the closest thing it most it most resembles the spiritual reality the spiritual love and to the extent that we had this idea that to the extent that the mother or the lover thinks this person is special because of their relationship to me the more that relationship becomes dark in the more that it becomes illusory and the more that one the more the debt removed
 and there's less Shadow right the more that this person special because they're God's special person in special other part of God in the part of God's energy the more the Datsun than the more that this light and if we just related like that
 there would be no hay to no jealousy and and no indifference and all that and this it's such an essential
 question because it gets to the idea of like
the questions that are so prominent
 I so upfront
 in today's world of like it just in all the tensions that are in the world right now and how they play on and how they're spoken about because there's tension in the world right now cuz I don't know if you noticed but like for instance for someone to say why aren't you bossy people why why you're just spiritual bypassing you're just concerned about your own little spiritual thing and you're not addressing all the problems in the world the fact is is that we are work but we're dressing the car rather than the symptom
 and so it in other words if you say if someone say why aren't you protesting right now what's going on here or there you know what why aren't you why aren't you directly counter in the sufferings in this world
 are answered
like
 if that's how you have chosen to use your time and energy we recognize and applaud the selflessness in that right like to the extent that it is that you're giving so you're sacrificing your time and your energy to try to help others that is noteworthy and the end that is special Inglorious however we want to doing it without becoming hateful a handful but we are also doing the same thing except you're going to the symptoms like a big whack-a-mole you saw the product in it yeah she never saw these problems practice they just wear out their energy burns up but if you if you solve this one social malady
 there's a hundred more of them out there and it is soon as you turn to the next one another one's going to pop up again so we applaud you for for going ahead and and and
applying trying to apply some kind of solution to the two that problem but we're saying is there's a there's a a common cause to all of these maladies and that is that we're seeing the world in the wrong way we're seeing what we were misunderstanding who we are in relation to this world and based on that misunderstanding we're creating darkness in so many different ways and so many different places now if we were to go right to that root cause
 then this world will begin to resemble this the spiritual right if we could address that root cause the root cause is that I see this world is mine I see my purpose in this world is to enjoy the resources of this world that's creating the shadow that's when we're getting between God and the world when we say no I see this whole world is God's that and then there's no Shadow now there's nothing between God in the world right now
I did this this was his point is we're trying to address the sufferings in the world by sharing this knowledge and this knowledge is it it's the one of this the rising tide lifts all the boats all the different realities in the world are addressed by this one clear idea that we have misunderstood our relationship with this world
 and let's try to understand that so we've dedicated our time and our energy our resources to help to helping raise awareness of that in the hopes that it can help address all of the sufferings of the world
 I think that the basketball as soon as the shadow should have been having those amazing yeah that that that shadow is it really gets to to the heart week
between it there's God in this world and when we get between God in the world seeing it is ours
 then there's Darkness thank you so much and would you like to have that we want a long with that along with time with that I think that's a good one let's get more people like you thank you Jamie
 who's next on the list is Eileen shoveling shovel in the mercy we can just call Mercy now it's Richard Mercy welcome how are you
 cuz I need to speak right into the microphone your face right on there first thank you and Mara and you could do before spreading what trailer probably had wanted us to do and I'm bringing us to Krishna Consciousness and reminding us who we are so it's just such an honor to be present physically with you and Mara and and kiss to go to be with you every day so I just want to say thank you
I don't be with you I lie you thought we were a i r real it what do you do for a job and you and me don't do cuz we are helpless we need your help 2727 okay so you're not 27 then interest in spiritual spirituality for you actually we're on a India and India retreat with Kelly Skinner could I go pee and Matt her and then was hooked by kirtan and and different
 thoughts on relationship with Krishna
and I wanted to know more and it was it was divine timing as Divine timing the bright light of Vermont teams of people tag teams of people to enter into my life to get that message across and it's beautiful to look back and just remember it appreciate how that we're not alone there is a higher source that is trying to not just like we're just reaching out to God pray for stuff but Gods actually reaching towards us to bring us in and we'll tag certain people in your life that can speak your language to bring you closer that's so great I do have to make sure Eileen gets real close to the mic switch your question dear on today because this question came from a conversation Sarah and I had recently and Lori Pags just that it's Sarah's birthday
 so my question is best we
talked on the show before you've answered some questions about going and how to prepare to go on Retreat whether it's an emergency Retreat or at a retreat like going to Indy app and my question is coming about coming home from Retreat so it sucks about prepping for a retreat but coming home and I recently came back from India and really struggled with reintegration last year I attended a holy name retreat with that scene and Asami and I had a similar experience so this is on something that's been really kind of in my in my head so my question is what are suggestion and practical things that you suggest to really maximize all we learn and experience on our Retreats when we come back home to avoid that kind of I'll call it boxing roller coaster that we put ourselves on when we come back into the world
 good question
 take a shot of this
do I want to do once you get started with it
 congratulations it sounds like you fully immerse yourself in these Retreats which is
 importance if you want to make the most out of it just like if you're taking a yoga class not only do you follow the teacher's instructions to make sure you breathe deep you make sure of your minds that all over the place so the same thing can happen I can go on these Retreats but he can be thinking about all I've got business to do at home I got other stuff in my life or who is this person you can question you can doubt you could fiery can and you can live in your mind like that and not get the most out of the same experience so it sounds like you fully immerse yourself you sort of leave your old world behind you to get some higher taste you get some bless you get some Joy then you come back to your old stomping ground in your old circle of people the same workplace and all the sudden it's like who are these people have nothing in common with
and people get depressed people get sad and people but you should understand that that that's sadness for that. It's it's actually meant for you to say okay how can I integrate this into my life now it's not going to be that that's why we have Retreat that's why we have pilgrimages to get so high you're almost floating away don't expect the world to get you don't expect to the world you just took two weeks of your vacation time to travel a 17-hour plane ride to sit on the floor too Dusty Village and sing songs are you nuts
 yes you are not buy material standards but you got some type of taste you got some type of sweetness you got some type of high and you have to figure out how that can how you can protect that almost like within a magical bubble without resenting all the other people around you why aren't they more spiritual why isn't he more spiritual is she more spiritual I wish my boss
more spiritual cuz sometimes we can take it out on the world I also say try not to
 blame the world's make it make it this is my make it your thing make it your thing that you have that bubble of sanity and figure out what what that spiritual life means now within this context and how can you keep that high without resenting people for also not being high that's what I find happens I find when I come back I can't even explain it to people I can explain that experience was an emotional it was a spiritual with Menthol I was just in The Sensational experience but it's hard to explain so I keep that woman in my private experience and I try to be very very delicate with everybody else and then just like give them little bits of how I've changed but but if how I change
that I'm resentful towards everybody then they're they're going to jail so the best thing you could do to keep that high is on your downtime but in spiritual information if there's ends all there and podcast in YouTube videos and lectures and curtains to keep that high going it's the reason why we do a daily all the podcast so you can binge listen so you can listen to on a regular basis so you can hear truth or wisdom on a regular basis and feel the same high and then when you're feeling a little low and you go on a pilgrimage to go on a weekend retreat you got damn these things that don't make any material sense I got a bunch of people here in this living room they just worked all weekend and what if they get in return
 I got wake up there and get the
but it but it doesn't they did but they've done labor just like hard labor that you can pay people to do sometimes and but everyone's joyful on everyone's Blissful so it won't make material sense to others but it can make material sense to you by keeping that vibration High when you're out of that emerge and then then then you'll learn to deal with other people in a more Gentle Way and at the end you'll keep that high from pilgrimage or Retreat until your next time and it's important to have this emergence as well
 that you want to keep it going you want to share something with that well let's keep it. I think those are the same option to keep a call again to share the same thing I see I thought you meant let's go let's keep this question going for a bit yet you know it's been said Eileen that it is no
measure of Health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick Society
 and so am I sense if you're getting healthier by going on these Retreats when you going to come back you may not be well adjusted to it you know cuz it is profoundly sick so I ended up going on a business trip to Las Vegas right off you should
 don't worry if you're feeling a little bit maladjusted to to this world when you come back but but but also the Destructo maybe I'm having trouble keeping my Consciousness on the platform I had it on when I was in burn. You know that that's you know I think maybe the essence of this drama that you had time enough in a holy place in that can awaken something in you send me special some of it's coming that way cuz it's so
that is fine so all the pieces are fitting together I feel right
 now you have to find a way to keep that awake when you come back into another world right cuz you are in a place where you had an exclusive engagement in the spiritual energy and and so it didn't require a struggle it didn't require an effort to keep your Consciousness on that platform but then you come back and you're forced to engage with material energy and it sounds like you're in case you like some serious Las vegas-bound material energy and and said there's a struggle right it before you know I was in the current and now it's like I'm swimming against the current and so it kind of gets back to the to the last question you have to begin to see this world in the light of bhakti in the light of Krishna Consciousness in the in the light of bug of agita ensure Bob the time
 and that's going to require practice and that's something that that you do for most of us
going to be up a process of maturation of our vision of this world over over the course of
 daily practice of the course of regular trips you know maybe perhaps regular to build images that you do yeah and you come back and and and You Begin it you know hopefully we all begin to
 see the world wherever we are in that light like when I'm a Dominus easier to see the world in that light and then when I come away from an event I'm still seeing the world in that light it and I'm not saying I'm there but I will say this that people ask me all the time like if I'm in India they say are you looking forward to going home or are you you know are you
 I guess the opposite of looking forward to it you know like are you dreading the thought of going back to the West
 or if I'm in the Wessex are you really looking forward to going you know and honestly nowadays A Course in a sense I look forward to going there and it
when I'm there I don't exactly want to leave it but I honestly I just kind of feel like I have my service to do wherever it is it's got you know so like I sound like I'm counting the days you know on either and we just have to kind of develop that Krishna conscious Vision so probably saying you know you think I'm sitting in New York but action driving right now you know we we need to come to that level so you know they're practical things you need to do if when you're in that Holy place
 it's not just the place there's certainly something about the place itself but
 what's happening in that place is everybody's moving in the same direction and so your is easy for you to be exclusively engaged in Botti
 you need to hear you can't right you got a job to do with people that don't relate you got to get on a plane and go to Las Vegas and
 do financial services for people
I'm with people that have no connection and are actually maybe going to the exact opposite direction of where you're trying to bring your awareness and so you got to cut out chunks of your time is running out for saying you know that are exclusively devoted to bhakti you know and you really have to honor those times and end
 Elevate those times like those become priority times you know when you're so it whether it's listen to the podcast in the morning and spend some time doing some reading and spending some time to me some chantay cutout you know a few weeks when you go maybe go on a pilgrimage you know exclusive time on a daily basis exclusive time you know where you have some weeks that you dedicate you know it's like that you have to cut out some exclusive timing and through that and this is real important
 you have you have to culture
 you have to nurture
a deeper and deeper and deeper understanding of the highest truths about t
 right like that you know that the love that the residents of a David have for Krishna even though we don't feel feel it the way we're meant to feel it now do you know who the love of Radha and Krishna in the essence of all of that
 we need to deepen and deepen and deepen our Clarity and understanding that idea for that ideal
 and carry that with us all the time like carry within the heart that it's would never separate from it the more that we understand it
 the more they will be able to carry it with us all the time and then it will be less of a struggle you may still have your worldly responsibilities
 but it'll be it won't it won't and I should caution as you know like we're always
warned not to be to be cautious as we move through this world but how we relate with what we the people are the energies that we come in contact with but some more that that that I that highest idea of bhakti
 the more that it's
 cherished in your understood and cherished in your heart the more you'll be able to carry it with you everywhere and you'll become more immune to that the material energy in and it'll be less of a struggle you won't feel that I think that's the words that you used right struggle
 yeah it'll be less of a struggle for you and you'll be more at ease in this world thank you so much
 Chevron the mercy
Ascot yeah is new new name Scott heating and plumbing has changed to hot Scott that's his new email address at Yahoo is involved in heating and plumbing right Scott heating and plumbing with a hot Scott Cameron Scott. Scott how are you I'm good you are hard-core guy I spent a long time living in the shadows OK and the dark place the Shadows gave me the ability to see him in a moment of need and I just looked up and you know I took the hand and then even when I took the hand I turned my back on them so to speak and then he was right behind me the whole time it was just so Christian has got your hand he doesn't let go
yeah you can try to run from but he's just got there I was waiting for you to break into the song right there when you did you think of a song
 now what am I going to think back think think back go back to the 70s what was that forgot they said that you took the hand
 you don't have to put your hand in the hand of the man in the Hat you know I've ever seen that at all I mean I actually when I first got sober I started going to a gnostic meetings and the analogy I draw is that I had a very a lifetime of a dirty floor or second they're agnostic post that mean yeah I didn't know that especially when you're first coming out like
first come in like off the street and stuff like that it's just a way to just give you some ideas without having to shove spirituality down your throat sure my first meeting and I almost turned me off and so to get that the analogy I draw is like if you have a dirty floor you got to sweep the floor first before you mop it because if you start Sprite use going to spread the dirt around so you but at the end I mean when I stop going to those meetings it was just one of those things where it really wasn't working for me because there was a god-sized hole like you say you know in my heart and I needed some sort of spiritual spirituality in order to really progressed in my recovery just wasn't going to work so I'm just very very grateful and thanks to everyone for helping me get another day so thank you sweet and beautiful I just want to put this out there everybody on this Retreat will fully admit that Scott has an incredible attitude
good attitude attitude of gratitude attitude of gratitude all the time carrots with them I just tried to follow the example you guys said so is as I study that cheat on your charts and Rita I'm just a little confused as to who the six goswami tsar and what role they play in Morty kindness Lila question 26 the Swami's they're doing the work for Lord say Tanya to excavate these places I've been covered over forgotten about by Time by Invaders a lot of Invaders came too much tore up and David just destroyed things and just wiped out stuff and so the Sixers Swami's were sent out to recover it to collect all the people going to Hindu is when you see people with
Eastern thought you know and even kirtan community that didn't really know which necessarily going on I just feel like it's a good thing as a positive thing we're all one raw God but they're sort of like lost and because the van is 2 written in such a berry Broadway that it attracts people from all different categories of what they want a different demographic some people just want to feel better some people want to just be a little healthier to be a little more mindfulness stuff from a higher power from a source and some people want pure love, pure devotion so The Vedas is a big
 Reservoir that everybody can dip in even if you want a little cup of water so the go Swami's they went and they just extracted Baki from all the teachings and that was another one of their missions to to ReDiscover these holy places to excavate some of the find the lost deities
and you extract extract bhakti from all the teachings of The Vedas and write on them and it was one of these massive contributions headed by these six go swap mommy's I'm not quite sure why we highlight the six but but but I know there was supposed to Ami's that were to Tanya sent before him like looking up goswami and blue garbage the Swami is well you know why there were six why they call them 6 you know honestly we're going to text I was going to say myself exactly why the six cousin as you're saying there are other goswami the right there with them and that are for them a little Kim before you what we know this like one way to answer this question
 is to kind of look historically at the whole spiritual tradition that grows out of The Vedic literature right its vast
got so many different ideas so many different grade teachers and lineages and so on
 in all different kind of ideas about what's important some people emphasize performing your duties and varnashrama you know like you know being a little following these
 social obligations you know three strictly you know it in living very Noble life that way performing ritual to receive you do material benefit in a in a dharmic context
 some people see a cheating Liberation is the goal letting go of all the things of this world minimizing all of the ritual and minimizing all of all those external considerations performing worldly duties letting go of all of that seem all of that is illusory and then becoming free
we of the influence of this world on our Consciousness experiencing some kind of inner Bliss and relief
 some people see that's the goal of the whole thing you can find it here in the pawn shops at speaking about it's on other people had an idea of Bach to you know that there's a divinity
 that that is our source that is personal that's behind all the workings of this world then you can connect an intimate love with that Divinity and that's the goal of it all ends and there are those are like if you took the whole thing and broken into three categories would look like that but there's so many nuances and so many different ideas and so many texts and so many they often seen their contradicting one another and how to make sense of it all and what happens is different
 achari has different prominent teachers come forward and they say I've worked through it all and this is how you can understand it clearly and this is what should be emphasized and so on and then they write their commentaries on these ancient text and they create their lineage
along with that you could say like a
 a message and a culture to to cultivate that idea
 and so we see great you know from ramanuja charya by Shankar do you know so many prominent figures did that through writing commentaries and establishing sometimes they stablish at Temple or they stablish like a mutt like a you know a lineage of monks that teach all this or whatever what should I tell me did we see the he didn't write books he didn't write commentaries
 he stayed in Juggernaut Tori and he went DDD been to relishing the mood of rata and but he taught these go Swami's
 his unique amalgamation
you could say his unique understanding
 perspective on all of this he taught it to them if spoon-fed it to them it's a want to reach a tiny charts and Rita we see him speaking to especially do we see him speaking to Sonata goswami a group of the Swami
 and their ideas and their books came straight through him so he empowered these these go Swami's
 to give a unique special beautiful bhakti understanding of vedanta and so and in each of them kind of had their own unique responsibilities I guess you could say it like that or contribution like Rupa goswami was empowered to teach on Russia you don't have to teach on drug on new go back to teach the method for achieving this Divine love
in his book about the rest of me to send you is just like a incredibly significant contribution that he and improper translate that is not true devotion
 and Sonata goswami taught some Banda Guiana understanding the all the categories and how they relate to it you know everything from your this material realm and it's different gradations within it up to the entire universe and who are the Davis who are the demigods what what is the level of their Consciousness you know up to the different layers of the spiritual realm up to Krishna Radha Krishna sloka by David if you read his book we had talked with him Rita Masterpiece you just masterful work you know that that helps us understand all of these some bud how we relate you know an inn in the the strata you know of of of all the way up to Glow coming down at the Geva go to Swami's in one sense like the classical
occifer like he's the one that's kind of writing commentaries you do realize staying out do you know chankar saw this way ramanuja sword that way we're going to we're going to tell you we're going to pick through all the books and defend this point of view if you do defend that the love of radha-krishna is the highest thing to find The Bob & Tom is the highest revelation of all the Vedic scriptures and is coming and he he wrote books of philosophy this Hudson Darby's was his very important contribution where he breaks everything down and go pop bottle goswami very you know what they say that actually he is the one that like Jiva goswami to Tommy's works like he was kind of behind them all like we would Jesus says that I'm basically just taking all the stuff that gopala Dr goswami but it was like it needed to be added in certain parts of it were missing cuz you know everything was written on these leaves and everything and they would dry out and fall apart and eaten by bugs that's what he's like saying he basically lay this out I'm just
doing some really important editing work like he kind of gave credit like that in and send Uncle soames other important work was a hard body blast which is it just teaches like all the different how vaishnava lives and how if I should be practicing and that was also coming from golf about to go swimming it's not actually says he wrote it Go by but it says more less I kind of edited it so like they're kind of giving credit to each other but Copa butterscotch Swami's contributions real important that I taught that highest Revelation the priority now is like what is what is what is that pure love
 he rewrote some some also very beautiful important books Daytona Charger me to largely comes through him because he spent all that time which would you Tanya in in poori and broken up article Swami's like I said I think we know the least about him if I remember correctly I think he told Christian. Skybridge don't write about me and Chase
share so much if you I think it was him that Christmas cover I said I need to hear from you because he stayed with SRI chaitanya Emporia for 8 months on two different occasions so 60 months total is like I need to hear from you about this is like I'll share it all with you but it was long as you promise me one thing whatever it is that you don't write about me in your book just out of humility he didn't want to be seen as you know going down in history of special some seaweed we know that perhaps the least about him I surely I know the least about him but he was also right there with him and he's praised as being you know the depth of his devotion that he would sing he would gather at the rotted Amador Temple and burned oven with other go Swami's and seeing all the verses of Bob time in many different M into different Melodies and he'll be crying in his voice if he choking up and he was just incredibly dear
 to all the to do all the devotees in Randleman
ASRock another saying you know sometimes it said that they were doing these two things right they were going pouring through all of the different fast fate of literature's and
 getting to his Essence and then providing that Essence to us in a very clear way
 in response to all of the other ideas that have been handed down over the centuries say nose look here you can see it all first understand that The Bob & Tom is the is the ultimate permana the ultimate proof and then true that we can understand everything and through that we understand that Krishna is the origin of all existence and that this world is a transformation of his spiritual energy and that soul is simultaneously one and different from him it's the goal is to enter into that legal again the ghost that was what she cheat on you Todd and the go Swami's
 did the they wrote The Thesis has you know they they they went through all this texting and explained all that so that other
Asperger's and other people could benefit from that explanation and also shoot your time you sent them all to burn dabin
 apartment as well to recover all those holy places to find them cuz they're kind of gone there, just lost covered over and so they built really important temples important books and if you really want to understand them and chased any charge me to find so much so that would be really good for you to read and there's a song The Sun Goes for me off to come you know it's a beautiful song written by train about your charger and if you look that up the shoe trees shut goswami astika then that song I ate versus explains beautifully who they were and what they are or what they're all about what their mission was
