 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul Farm is his wisdom of the sages a daily spiritual podcast that makes ancient wisdom relevant today this is episode 1332 with your horse riding off and co-host an educator the Barclays Center in New York this stupid house welcome to the show everyone welcome thank you welcome thank you so much
 this way. We're okay it's Friday Friday everybody and this morning we are iPod
I pulled a Biden I read this is where we will bring Linda on to talk about the new platform Linda we're going to unmute you because we are making some very cool changes due to some very dedicated listeners others and Zoomers we're just like very good with building out websites and stuff in part of their service was they wanted they said hey we like what you guys are doing we listen to this program every day but you know it's got some shortcomings let us help you build this out so you can reach more people and they said we do this as a job but
 are you as a service we want to do it for you guys as a service and no mucus to we're just bounced walking into walls not that computer savvy you know we're dropping things for tripping with spelling stuff on ourselves
little bit I supposed to get some food out stuck on her shirt on our beards but anyway these guys came in with a team and they're working on a whole new platform for everybody and I know a lot of you guys your Patron numbers we want to thank you for that
 but there are so upgrading that entire platform by archiving everything perfectly like you want a yoga class you don't have to scroll through rubber once again why don't you let Linda explain this I think she's so you don't think I should just explain Linda is you know she's been in the corporate world to manage tons of things for decades in retirement we were like well you listen to show you everyday why don't you manage just now you take all your skills and help me and who's stupid manage our lives in this podcast it was he who gets more difficult to manage a large Corp
patient or us she mad she managed Microsoft but cannot manage me thank you Linda for all your service and run off when he's giving you a direct Mission manage these two and you're doing great how are you thank you so much it's my honor to
 really serve this community is the way I look at it and and keeping things moving forward as part of the pleasure of that yes it is harder to Amanda G wagon off then to manage a team of 500 at Microsoft but that's okay too exciting things happening this week tomorrow the 1st is the next session of stage groups will launch and we talked about that on Wednesday it's going to be a short and we're calling at summer school it's only 8 weeks so that's very exciting
and you'll be able to access this age group leaders on the new platform so tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. right after the show you'll be able to access this new platform for wisdom of the sages on wisdom of the sages.com what you'll do is you'll go on to the website that URL and it will be a new format you'll see that there will be a welcome and what's exciting about this new format is that it used to be that for wisdom of the sages you'd have to go to multiple different places to get everything that you could access as a patriot remember you go on patreon there would be classes there although super hard to find you would go on Discord for the community chat you go on Instagram and Facebook for social media etc etc the beauty is under this new wisdom of the sages site you will find everything under one umbrella
it's a real benefit and you know we are going we plan to send out emails to everyone to let you know exactly what you need to do in order to sign up for the new site because they are two different companies two different platforms we don't hold your bank information nor can we accept on your behalf charges come to the new site there will be a little bit of work on your part to join the new platform and then once you have the confirmation of joining the new platform feel free to cancel your patreon subscription I just did this this morning myself so and you are first because I never very official you know I think patreon was great for wisdom of the sages when things got started because it was it gave you the ability to like really kind of bring together the things that
talked about on the podcast but wisdom of the ages has become so much more than just a podcast it really is about the community and everything that we're bringing on to this new platform will only bring that together even more so and so we will ask for a minimum subscription of $5 for the new platform because really is going to help support bringing much much more to this community I mean we have a focus through the podcast through Retreats through stage groups on community we're building out so much more around Sage Academy and the ability to really learn and go more deeply around this bhakti practice and then we you know ends in the near future will start to build out an element called sage care so we asked for a minimum of a $5 in order to be able to bring all of this to the community and continue to dedicate the time and energy
ordered to serve this community and the proper way you know when I first signed up I thought about it as okay this is something I join every day and listen to every day I'll sign up for you know a minimum of what I would pay for say a streaming subscription then I found that I engaged so much in this community I thought okay well everytime I cancel a streaming subscription because I'm not going to watch anything on that you know I'm not watching that much anymore then I'll put that money towards this subscription so you know because I really think about the value that it brings into my life and that's how I made the decision around what I offer it's a very personal decision and we respect that for every one we just at humbly ask you to give you know what you think is appropriate with a minimum of $5 so that we can do what we need to do and before I go
what if it would still be a million-dollar are we going to do it on Zoom anymore or meet me for stupid really don't know even that much about the platform your question is are we going to do this I think the real question is are we going to take the the daily podcast new meeting and bring it on to that platform that's what you're asking right like what we're doing right now will this be on the platform run Zoom I was at work so we're going to do is the plan is to move to the platform but we're going to do something slowly we're going to continue to use them for the foreseeable future because what we want to do is get comfortable get people comfortable moving off of Patron onto the new platform and ultimately that the capabilities of platform is really incredible I mean we have the ability we can get the show on the platform we stay on the platform and we want all of that
 is that as
you have people transition that supporting members get access to those things so you know expect that further changes and enhancements will come we have over 500 classes on the platform right now that people will have access to it they get signed up and if you don't want to wait for as I said if you don't want to wait for the email with instruction because you think you hey lady you don't have to sell me on this I want to go right away then you know log on to his mother stages.com tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. and hit join now and you will be able to sign up for your subscription on that platform and then once you have that confirmation feel free to go and cancel cancel your patreon subscription and I will closely be connecting with subscribing member current subscribing members who supported members in order to ensure that you have the information you need

 we're all just trying to do this together and me and Christina are underwater with things is trying to keep our regular programs are live programs my farm programs are teachers training are rioting and stuff like that without you guys we would be buried and also want to thank the community for keeping this going for 4 years that the Patriot Community has been beautiful because it could exist would have to have to do something else you know if you don't want and so want to thank everybody that is community-supported thank you so much now it's going to be in a patron
in the circle of sages is what it is I love that Circle platform on a platform called Circle really you won't even know that it is you just look like a website
 is.com
 whatever App Store you access and then you'll just log onto you'll just use your laundry done in the app and you'll have access to your wisdom of the sages platform in the ass so another way to say this., still be there available for everyone but subscribers will be able to get any one of the problems with issues that's a with Patron
 was it it's just like one long stream and so we would you know we have over 500 classes and courses on that street but it's just like you can't it's so hard to ask
this is just like you'd have to dig into years and years back you could try using tags but you don't even know what tags to use and but now it's like Netflix you go there and you see everything laid out it's like oh there's a course in that course that Corson in and they all have their thumbnails and that you know and you can really see if there's a lot of stuff here and not only that but with this you know with this kind of really easy to facilitate kind of you know interaction both run off and I are you know really kind of committing ourselves to being there and have been producing more you know of a posting more stuff there and so I think it'll be okay no perfect platform to do that
 thank you absolutely it's the visuals are really stunning and you know there's a real consistency across the platform and things are so easy to find it's it's incredible again please check it out if you have questions email support it wasn't of the stages.com or come directly

 or just really speaking to provide
 yeah maybe a lot while you are in this material world you will exhaust all the reactions of Pious activity by feeling happiness and by acting piously you will neutralize Empire SEC tivities because of the powerful time-factor you will give up your body but the glories of Iraq
will be sung in the upper planetary systems and being fully freed from all bondage you'll return home back to godhead cuz this reminds me of a nugget nugget from Saint Francis that this reminds me of it is that the one you're talking about
 are you there
 I reckon. Froze up on us you there other
 okay I guess we're going out this Frozen
 so let me just take it. Let me just let's let's go to this verse. Can you hear me
 all right
 I hear I think I hear Rugrats Whispering sounds like he's rescreening maybe someone can on the on the chapel can tell him that he's
he seems like he's down but let's go to the verse
 I read again my dear.
 Lourdes in Revelation says to to provide that it doesn't matter that you're in this material world and that's it inspiring message to get right it's not that this yoga or the spiritual practices just to escape you say it's okay that you're in the material world they are operating within the the virtual reality of this world that's all right but he says but you should always continuously hear the instructions and message is given by me in other words hear the sacred text hear the talk you know like Bob and Tom like bug of agita excetera and always stay in and that way you always stay absorbent thought of me why me why does one person out of all people because he is the Super Soul existing in the core of everyone's heart when you connect with him you connect with everyone it's like
attach yourself to the network when you attach yourself to him and it says therefore give up fruit of activities give up the idea of being independent from me connect with me and said okay and said that so the next two or three red today
 my dear. Why you are in this material world you will exhaust all the reactions of Pi SEC tivity by feeling happiness and others who sang here's how Karma works that you've accrued ton of Good Karma or you're going to burn that off cuz even good, we're not so interested in we were interested in operating beyond the platform of karma we want to do so even your good results that are coming from your piety and you're going to burn that off just by feeling happiness in this world and by acting continuing to act pies in this world you going to neutralize any impiety that you made for me is kind of like a formula for how devoted lives in this world
 and they says and because of the powerful time-factor while you're still
sing with in the virtual reality and in the time factor is downloaded and installed in that virtual reality so because of that powerful time Factory you're going to die eventually of the glories of your activities with the song in the upper planetary systems and being fully free from our bondage you were you at the end of this life you will return you step out of the of the Matrix you will escape the the the virtual reality and you can you return to the spiritual realm welcome Diamondback I'm badder can you hear me I can hear you yeah okay great I got froze and we're having some internet problems here we need our Zoomer Manish back to work on our internet here it was like you were frozen but like I could still hear you're Whispering or so is weird is the Nugget now I didn't read the Nugget now the Nuggets we good now it has a lot to do with this verse the Nugget Saint Francis of Assisi do you want me to do on a rainy day
that when you leave this earth you can take with you nothing that you have received only what you have given the counter intuitive right right yeah a full heart in Rich by Honest service love sacrifice and courage
 I always say
 since we can't keep an we tend to think we will find our
 we tend to think that in this world we will find our our self by collecting things but we can't hold on to anything there for the great sages say we're not born here to collect cuz if you collect you just can't keep any way we are born to give and that's all we can do in this world we're here for a few moments and we can give some love we can assist people on their pad
but don't expect to own anything or anybody because it's all going to get stripped away from us and culture teaches us not to know you are your stuff is your value the things that you own your value even have we even have this word your net worth now you're worth your net worth is not some accumulation of stuff that's your net stuff your net worth is what Saint Francis of Assisi is saying your net worth is your contribution in this world what would he say he said you were your full heart you're in Rich on a serve your love your sacrifice your courage these are the real valuable things and we talked about people who have those things even after they are dead and let's face it for him before on our death bad in the things that were really attached to our
 are loving relationships it's others that we have connection with it's not like in a new ones on their deathbed saying
Tamara this could be my last breath can you anyway you can take some pictures of my truck and it in and email it to me so I can take one look at that truck before I die we're not going to attach to our stuff on their deathbed attached to our relationships with their enriched by love and service Etc and of course attached to God and the culture of love that we that we create our service to God
 thank you very much. Thank you for sharing that
 thank you Francis say Francis yeah it's his it it's his counterintuitive formula right look at look at this life is one stretch right and in what sense you want to end up the end with like a in what sense you're collecting but he's saying that you really only collect by giving right that's all that's left in the end
you given
 and you have to give your full hard knot card
 fully right give everything like I live entirely
 forgot live entirely for others
 and how do you get there how do you how do you get that full heart you get some rich vaiana service Services done without expecting anything in return
 login a really caring about each other sacrifices I sacrifice your time I got to sacrifice your well if you got to sacrifice your body or senses got to start you know you give things up if it's got to be real it's not just talk right or sure are rich in a courage to the innocent you know have you seen the film brother Sun sister Moon
 no I really don't watch movies get out of your watch horrible watch movies you never watch the movie I have watch the movie okay I was asking you if I don't know them
I was asking you that I was asking about if you had seen this film and then you went on and proud to watch so many movies I have not seen this film that's all I was asking yes or no would have sufficed I don't watch much is a is a movie worth watching
 oh yeah that's definitely a snoozer knows which one you think I'm going to stay awake at 8:07 at night
you like music right and here is a dove it's kind of like that when did the soundtrack no others he was awarded a contract by Donovan yeah he came back from he came back from the war but he got very sick in the war they brought him back home saying yeah yeah like the Crusades you know and you know they had to bring him back and I think in while he was sick he really had some Revelations about life his father was like a wealthy Merchant like cloth Merchant and you know it was expected that he was just going to follow this is where the courage comes in it was expected he was just going to follow in the footsteps of his father and Beauty as wealthy materialist
 and he just could not live that life you never just wasn't in him and he's actually a
you know I forget all the details but he's kind of being criticized by his father and by others it's just being this lazy guy you know all those really deeply spiritual sure and I think his father was so upset with him that all he went to kind of like that the town May or some kind of like political figure in the town
 you can visit all these places and you see such a cc is like a holy down it's like you're being it like in one of these Indian Holi times it's so nice and end he was kind of being judged his father's going to put them on trial kind of like publicly almost like in the public square and a Saint Francis just said you know I can't live this life and any just he's like he was kind of renouncing everything like I'm walking away from it and then he took off all his clothes and you just came to us but Heather so and he just walked away he was courageous like this year
all of it all of it wasn't like he's walking around his tighty-whities now he just dropped it off and and and you know that's you know everyone was saying all this guy's crazy or you're not all it takes courage sometimes so that Advance on his spiritual life and and he had that card so you don't need this is what he say he saying we needed this full heart you know and it's in a school require courage you know it's going to require a lot of service So I sacrifice ultimately we moved by love but then you have this that when you die you have the full hard are you actually have some cuz all that other stuff that you acquired it's all gone by that. Clothes are all gone for sure
 it's all right bro
 ever wonder about the origin of underwear like I don't and I don't work like where do we get it from like what were they wearing before under we bore tighty-whities what were they wearing
no response origins of underwear in the western culture okay alright let's continue on
 shut down that squirrel quick you're going on and on about it interrupted me with it and he went on in the area I'm not going to argue with you about that looks good, always remembers your activities and my activities also my activities also any chance the prayers you have offered becomes free in due course of time from the reactions of material life it takes that type of thinking that provide has to get out of that cycle of karma yet you know you could call the sex like the false true to your right one who remembers your activities is kind of like that like it's a benediction a chance these prayers he just chatted all these prayers you know the previous chapter he's saying yay
he's saying such potent right it's not like ordinary like you don't say this about any books that you pick up for any movie that you might watch course rubbing out and watch movies so that's not an issue for him is so unique so powerful it is cuz it's so connected to Spirit you know there's no end there's no ego and in
 in all these verses were like nothing they've ever wished OST connect to me sound like this is this narcissistic egoistic attitude he's even send just connect a lot
 and your idiot has his purifying effects he's saying the devotees as glorious as God if you bring if you bring your attention to the purity of prolonged Consciousness or the purity of the relationship between perlite and Vishnu then your Consciousness becomes purified because
Jordan the purifying content and end the divorce has so many ways is going to make this really clear like the the Diwali he considers no less than himself right that there's a verse from the Padma purana
 Ryland Adams salvation Vishnu riding a dumb
 what is the Smart operator on DVD in them Smarter on there that you know. She says it's too
 today today today be to Parvati that A-Rod Anonymous RV show in the monks are all the different types of worship that there is just no around and I'm put on Bishop has the best cuz he's the root of all existence right but then he says but but does not put out there on TV but hear me out Davie oh Goddess that the worship of the two Dia that was just connected to me particularly my devotees
that's still higher even higher than worship of God so it's it's it's it's kind of getting at that idea or or it may be that hesitation that we have all we got this egotistical Tyrant to the god demanding worship demanding attention Beyond him.
 Telephones good

 15 through 77 1700 Supreme Lord because you were to the Fallen Souls I ask you for only one benediction sorry I know that my father at the time of his death had already been purified by your glance upon him but because of his ignorance of your beautiful power and Supremacy he was unnecessarily angry at you falsely thinking that you were the killer of his brother
does he directly blasting your lordship the spiritual master of all living beings and committed heavily simple activities directed against me your devotee I wish that he be excused for the simple activities here it is the pure devotee pardons
 sends a devotee for Gibbs the one thing he wants to kill him and I'm saying you know what
 I'm going to I'm going to ask Karen about it I've already forgiven the devotees already forgiven of devotee takes no offense now he's going to say Lord I need you to forgive him that is the quality of a baka Baka already forget the boxer takes no offense but the Lord gets angry cuz the Lord is very dear to the devotee and vice-versa so now he's asking the Lord please forgive them they didn't know what they did is Christlike forgive them for they know not
not know what they know not what they do know what they have they have no not no not what they have done
 describe beautiful setting the example in a very beautiful right was offered anything he didn't ask anything for himself by the way I'm a Christian again tonight run sweeping Christopher all and I'm getting worked up we did go into the new platform is there would do right on the platform we did yesterday or cheat on he goes to the route the arch was beautiful so till I join join me at 8 tonight to Patriot members
 the Supreme personality God had said my dear perlado most pure a great saintly person your father has been purified along with 21 for fathers and your family because you were born in this family the entire Dynasty
has been purified more than asked for
 that's the power you want to help out your parents want to help out your kids doing to help out your grandparents the best thing you could do for them is to fully take responsibility for your spiritual life to the degree that you become purified and they love you which family members generally love us they become purified by that love because they're loving and devoted to take care of your own spiritual life is serious about your spiritual life you benefit your mom you better even if you have a mom that says you know what I don't believe in anything that you're doing I love you but you're crazy they benefit
 pretty cool even even hear any country Pooh benefit he was a hundred percent against it
 yeah it was really was and tagging Mystic I heard this quote I'm not sure if it's I like to quote Pro pods probably pod when I don't know the source but he's one of these things where did
it's like griping about his parents and Prophet said something like the body's parents are not ordinary
 and he said why I didn't you in probably my my father is really crazy he's this and that he probably said a devotees parents are not ordinary people and he said it three times and the idea is that if you're devoting they gave birth to you they are no longer in the we don't know who even your parents are with us because we don't know who each other I don't know I don't know you I don't know where you're coming from I don't know you
 you can do this for lifetimes you can be so you could you could be Saint Francis of Assisi I don't know I got to go somewhere say Frances in Pleasantville New York
 I didn't either
a person plus born in Indiana what whatever he could be you you could be safe Francis
 maybe that's why you like a sissy so much I know they're trying to get me to go there I know I've been trying to come to my hometown
 people that come to the Italy retrieved and never get the chance to go to see see it's not on me is unreal do I keep saying
 can I see part of it you can go hang out with them
 show me around show around your place
 Andie Case
 the parents are not ordinary the devotees are not ordinary that's for sure and even if they are ordinary you make them extraordinary by your devotional service whenever and wherever there are peaceful equipoise devotees who are well-behaved and decorated with all good qualities that place and the dynasties there
even if condemned or not purified that means if you are doing Suppose there was a horrible murder taking place in your apartment and stay over before 20-30 years ago they could be there's always these places like you know a mafia tours of New York City in Illinois that you got this is the place where I always eat lunch a really horrible Valentine's Massacre took place in Chicago is the Majestic building called The Majestic where Frank Costello was shot
 I survived
 Abbott and Costello who's Frank Costello the minister of the underworld or something like that he was like one of the original my fee has it it's not like someone some horrible scene takes place and they're like okay now we're going to
damn this haunted building clean it up there's a crew that cleans up blood and they paint the walls and they like is back on the rental market the next day you know we're not a bad energy still in their lot of bad energy
 you're not going there and hearing a chanting whenever and wherever they're peaceful equipoise devotees were well-behaved and decorate with all good qualities that place and the dynasties they're even condemned or purified that being sad I have no desire ever to purchase a haunted house and
 the first thing I would ask the realtor and they have to disclose this I don't know if you know that she was anybody for any one in this house did you check on that horse is ass and the realtor said I'm going to have to get back to you I'm waiting I'm waiting for you to get back to me on this one okay. No it's a nice phrase here to
it says that there whenever wherever they're peaceful equipoise of orders are well-behaved and decorated with all good qualities that's actually the decoration that's appreciated by the Lord right it's a good qualities it's not so much either we try to decorate ourselves with all kind of jewelry
 sometimes fancy clothes clothes cuz you know what you different different kinds of weed we consider these ornaments to be attractive what's the track and Krishna is the ornaments of good qualities
 yeah. Patients are tolerance or kindness or gratitude of Mercy the all these you know this you know that story about
 why am I forgetting her name on Dell
 enough under under under
and Alice one of the the 12 hours the great Mystic Poets of South Indian bhakti poets Mystic do they do anything mystical she's very making things up pretty sure they're there legends about her you probably get that kind of but what else shares it's not like that it was since she was the I believe she was a daughter of a priest at the temple
 you know this Ancient Temple of and end in her mind I think you know as even as a young girl I like little Corona or something like that you know she was just like I married to Lord Vishnu I married to Ronan us from childhood that is my that is my master and my husband and I and she has a little girls you know like Ike's cuz she kind of had access to the the places where you know all the preparation
the offerings for the DD were made so like one day she put on the Garland that's meant to be offered to Lord Vishnu
 and she look can you look at yourself in the mirror externally being a fence right at you would think right normally use the Garland for the deity and put it on yourself yeah that's that's that's all wrong she was a little girl when she did that little girl and she look at herself in the mirror you know with the garland on and then her father came in and was like no I don't understand now this we can't be offered this cuz we always offer first to Lord Vishnu and we can wear these after they've been offered as Prasad I'm right as a graceful but you don't take it in and wear yourself an offer it's like used that is so so so she was cool okay but but then that night he had a dream
 my Lord Rhonda not good business spoke to him
 it said
fresh when she wears it first and when she when she's putting that on she's not thinking oh now I look beautiful for the world right now is it now on the attractive one and everybody's appreciated my beauty she puts that on for my pleasure she's decorating herself not for the not for her own pleasure or to attract the attention of other she's she's decorating herself in that way for my pleasure so offered would let her wear them all the first of them at this year but that that that little Pastime is told a lot with the idea yes in a similar way we should not that we should wear the garlands before the office of these but we should decorate ourselves for the pleasure of of Lord Krishna pleasure of Lord Vishnu by buy decorative shelves with all these the good qualities of these and the side whose side of Luciana
 all those nice stuff so I don't hear you saying anybody that got those qualities to purify their old dying
image of damage dynasties has condemned the Hatfields and McCoys on family family they just won the vote in that family and there's a lot of times he's mafia families had like what one wants son became like them are the big-time mafia guy and then another one can Priests like this New York was I down there said that there's that guy actually he was the one that shot that little squirrel this year but he was the one who shot Frank Costello just around the corner from my house but his his brother was his famous some priests who really did like a lot of good for people like in the Bronx
 thank you scrap removal that was on the horse
girl in the whole sir. Because of being attached to devotional service to me my devoted does not distinguish between lower and Higher Living entities
