 already
 already and I don't have any other announcements
 it's okay so we're going to go into one of you know if you've been on the show you know that I mention all the time that there's about 27 songs that run through my head I'm rotation since I was four years old this is one of them
what's Juba pick it as a nugget
 I remember if I have memories of this song
 meet you at the 8th grade you know the belt buckle I appreciate the message in the song Now appreciated more than I could appreciate it when I was a kid when I was a kid Kansas was definitely not what I wanted to be listening to a really know what was cool so I just like ran the gamut I wore Kansas belt buckles REO speed rat wagon belt buckles Jay geils Band I didn't know what was no one told me what was cool and I wasn't quite sure and I wasn't ready to opt into like long hair and taught you know tight pants it was until Punk but I really got into music
 well you know what I remember the video cuz you and I were kind of raised on the 1st the birth of MTV right yes we were
really so much of a thing before that only a few bands have them like Adam and the Ants the B-52's Evo at you now you had to make videos that was very fact that was one of the more exciting times in my life when MTV just started off the video for this song Dust in the Wind that was just like you guys think it was just the kind of like dressed in like the kind of like him almost like tuxedos like they just came from the prom or like from a wedding or something and looking kind of guys you know what big beards and real long hair and they're sitting there like very solemnly singing a song and it kind of got like all kind of really cheesy boots cheesiest of background kind of
 fog funeral blowing lots of fog
but hey but hey you know what know whatever yeah that that we don't judge people by their tuxedos Journal there's a depth of their kind of like a although the song is about time is Calica timeless
 wisdom conveyed to the song little research the Kansas guitar is Kenny livgren wrote the song Dust in the Wind
 after reading a book of Native American poetry in the line that caught his attention was for all we are is Dust in the Wind
 what you're saying is trying to reach to it to the unit he was being inspired by a wisdom tradition he was tapping into something that's that's is timeless it's it's travels through you know it it's like it runs through all the wisdom traditions in comes to the surface to know it's important importance thoughts it's very easy to get
caught up in the minutiae of my existence like the minutiae of the any pain that's pressing pressing worry pressing fear and I tell you we're on our backs one day just like leaving our body and we invested so much time and anxiety come on it's so crazy I think the songs like this make you and end these wisdom traditions and the bog Tom make you do the big zoom out of say what is important to me what are the things I should be investing my time my thoughts in on a regular basis so before you read this why don't you go and grab your violin rather not then you can play along to this and have that violin solo remember
 now I don't remember I don't listen this I'm going to listen to song After the Show and we can close with it today it's not a real closer it's a sort of the end of the day maybe maybe Mary Mary do sweet baby Krishna tonight what do you think
 sure
sweet baby Christmas tonight at 7:38
 8 tonight Eastern Time
 alright so here's the lyrics I can sing it if you like I close my eyes only for a moment and the moment's gone all my dreams pass before my eyes it curiosity Dust in the Wind all they are is Dust in the Wind so okay just a larger is dreams are Dust in the Wind you know I dreamt of you last night sir I dreamt of you the last two nights but I don't remember no one there Dust in the Wind buddy you're thinking it's going to be big if that was it was very important was happening like you were doing something very important now I don't remember it. Of course because
my friend are dust and I think of your dreams can also indicate you know the plans for your life. Okay with my life and they never manifest or they do men fast and they're still Dust in the Wind either way and it's Dust in the Wind dancer's don't hang on the last forever so same old song just a drop of water in it and let's see oh my God that's so bad all we do
 crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
 Dust in the Wind
we are is Dust in the Wind
 I think this is where the violin comes into to do 2 to 10 and then
 all right now. Keep that no no no it's Eternal its heater is not Eternal its Eternal but it's always in flux what is eternal that doesn't change is the subtle subtle is the solid the spirit is the solid that's what we have to hold onto we hold on to that we hold on to the material and it crumples it crumbles to the ground though when you refuse to see these guys are like Mahatma okay it's all the bands back then were deeply thoughtful no no no
I would like the 80s
 remember to Venom victim
 is that was his name was big man I got a big Phantom used to have the vet in leather jacket is Camilla hardcore show so no I don't remember nothing last forever but the Earth and Sky Well we'd say something different that doesn't last forever it's slips away and all your money won't buy and all your money won't another minute by hi-five I can't buy another minute and that that always called me how they pulled that poetic switching the G around on that one I want
at your yes and all your money won't another minute Buy
 but it doesn't win all we are is Dust in the Wind yeah that's a basic aphorism as well Dust in the Wind all we are assessed with everything is Dustin with everything except
 everything's out of the spiritual on the message board Tim O'Reilly rights Tom and Tom from Slayer and Dave from Megadeth are both and did Jesus know days swing that pendulum swing it and Brian Head from Korn really know what I mean it's been there since it's good for them for them you know we're mentioning that this here it is in the Kansas song and then Kansas 33rd and they're being inspired by Native American poetry
 and we'll find it you know in the in the Bible
ashes to ashes dust to dust and course we'll find so much of this written in in The Vedic texts in the human body with Tom in the Bhagavad Gita in The Punisher eyes and so that's why I like stone walls Treasures coin collecting and so megalithic megalithic Marvels
 so it's kind of it's almost saying to us you know that if we're not thinking about this
 if we're not pondering this you know yeah it regularly if we're not bringing them you know it says all our dreams what was it everything all we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
 it may not even it's not even a conscious refuse to let you know
 it feels like it's almost
 and instinctive kind of need to turn away from
that that stoic truce that very quickly everything that's dear to me is going to disappear like it it's it's almost like some cruel trick of nature material nature and naturally we turn away from it and in all these great spiritual Traditions are saying you have to consciously bring your mind to this you have to make an effort you know to to contemplate this and if you do
 it can transform your it can transform this life in a very positive way and it can give you the the Billy just kind of crossover you know that without it you get your stuck in the cycles of Destruction with it only once you become aware deeply aware of it
 it gives you the ability to cross Beyond it you know to take care of it I always think of that because it kind of you do for the for the
for the person new to it the questions can be like but do I waste this life thinking about life beyond this life and I always think of you you know when you visited
 that that Laguna Beach temple for the first time it was all new to you and someone said to you there you know you don't just give this one life to God I'll just this one okay. Prospective it's like no don't you see the time very quickly destroys everything that you're working on here just take this one little life and you can cross Beyond it right and I think you always like to bring bring up that point that if you really get it it's not that this life is not just like this is the life of drudgery that you give up for the hope of a pie in the sky
actually you enter into the Timeless Consciousness in this life and and even in this life it makes it so much better sure what a cushion to on a regular basis your default list is zoom out that's why I like to change shop and cemeteries you see that especially around here that you get these Revolutionary War cemeteries were you just so you know I got it a plague knocked out seven children here they are buried together and you start to realize family is go down you know the Elder goes down he only live to 60 you know I'm I'm almost 60 right now and Easter to you that's why I like to see you know stone walls and just think of who the hell built this stone wall and where are they now what the hell are they doing now
 megalithic Marvels civilizations that were up going strong thriving decimated wiped out for Godin
it's important it's important to ponder kaszuba that's what I'm saying is we are we are growing and it is changing but our bodies are like the hands of a clock for the most part meaning they're moving but you don't notice them especially when you don't have a second hand they're moving but you don't notice them I don't notice that I'm aging today and I don't know if my kids are aging either but if I don't see my kids for three months or five months or six months or so he doesn't see me and sometimes people see me at a show and they know me from a record cover from 1988 and those oh my God I was like yeah I know it's quite sad isn't it will be a war or brindavanam
 what the hell happened to that have a lot of time for the devotees just like you look the same
 a lot of times it's
I also certain point but I will affect the time of day goodness passionate ignorance Laguna's affect our ages as well and I feel like if you if you add a lot of wisdom literature and practice of wisdom literature to your life as you get older you don't have to go to Thomas just like in the evening of our sodded like in the evening of our day you can really go to Thomas quick you can binge eat you can just watch Netflix you can drink a beer so you know what people do to quote wine down or you can add sadhna to your evening that's a big part of a little more like good morning rituals there's a big part of our evening ritual to sadhna in our evening time and add your so in the course of our your lifetime as you eat in the spring of life things are
they are there you could say maybe Vicky or maybe you know your your student and your your regulated and stuff like that then in the the busyness of may be married life your you got dreams and passions and hopes and in New York in the end of life north of 50 I would say north of 50 you start to wind down your passions of enjoying the material world if you add wisdom literature to your life you almost inherently become a little wiser because there's less hope of material enjoyment cuz as we were saying earlier in a few shows that window's closing was chance those opportunities clothes in one sense and some people say there's always a chance you know you can always start yet in one sense you can always start but as you add wisdom to your life you start to see this season of life for what it actually is and and
and actually it removes a lot of mental baggage we carry around baggage to try to impress people baggage to try to be out of control desires or an idea of actually what really is what is really quality in my life where the quality things I want to reach for what do I want to do you enjoy becoming more regulated you enjoy sense control you enjoy those things especially as we're adding the wisdom teachers to our life this season of our body will naturally go with it it in the same way winding down like in a reading sweet baby Krishna tonight you know that it's a it's a natural wonderful way to wind down the day and your makes your whole day sort of meditative you look forward to it in the evening and you look forward to getting old and soon our old age being a burden
 yeah it's like
this culture this yoga culture this Vedic culture
 it's amazing how it's like okay we're going to give you the acid a right she'll be awesome Great Sage mahamuni The Great Sage velocity sitting in a cave
 you know nestled way up there and you know it buddy come on you know compiling all of this the Piranhas the Mahabharata the bog with time you know for the benefit of us for the benefit of the people that call you but right now I need to get this down it's got it we got to have it has to be written it has to be provided in such a way where it's just not overwhelming dense philosophy I need to provide it through stories but these truths about life they need to be conveyed in a way that the culture can absorb it and his writings has permeated the total you know that the spiritual the philosophical the
cultural life of a windy and everything that followed it you know and insofar as a child you to hear this the stories you know as they would entertain you and excites you and it would be what your minds kind of that the foundation of your thinking and then as you're passing through all the different stages of life it's informing you you know in your decision-making and as you get older like you're saying you know it is the same it's like you're pouring the same water but you're kind of like processing it on deeper and deeper levels as you go to the point where you can be entirely detached from the things of this world you can see that time Factor operating an in realizing that it's it's urging you to to transcend to go beyond and so you got this it is given its given to such an incredibly rich
 literary tradition that you is it just transforms your
from beginning to end
 you know the desert desires could be compared to a fever almost like a sort of like I need I need I want got to have must have it right maybe the highest fever would be like an addiction where you're just now all your dreams yeah but as we add this was some literature to our ears and Consciousness and we apply it you will see a release in that fever the paper will go down and we say fever I'm not saying about how we got to dream big it's not like that it's an exhaustive type of dreaming desires exhaust us and they sort of can oftentimes just
 Crips what if I can eat like a fever like like like like like desire on top of Desire on harnessed and can burn us and burn us out and soda
so if you suffer from that and you notice it that's a burst thing but you will see it reduce as you add boxes to your life if you're struggling with that right now great news this stuff works great news this is in a doctor approved you know 9 out of 10 doctors recommend bhakti for your ear out of control material desires
 that other doctor he's in my body OK Google, which offers special of base and sees to the Supreme Lord Huron on tuner Narayan Rishi the super most human being until mother sarswati the goddess of learning

 read from Schumacher Tom Canto 7 chapter 9 text 20 skin exciting here Young's Claude
 he's got his desires under control he Ponders
 okay
 that's our word of the day today under
 in a little prayer live
Now is offering his
 his prayers that are very much in Rich with philosophical insight into life theological philosophical
 just a little boy before we get on what do you think of yesterday's interview with are the SRT that the stuff came up from you would you say I thought was very nice was very nice I was just thinking about witnessing people dying right in front of you
 you know running to them with the shaligram Sheila please help you in the mouth if you miss that interview yesterday who is with the person who is in the air and it was in the Iraq War he was deployed three times head of a platoon it was like and he had so many interesting stories and witnessing people dying right in front of you then I started thinking what who were a after the show is just traffic who were these people
that at the end of their life
 Lord Vishnu came to them in the form of a deity in the form of Tulsi in the form of someone chanting in their ears I was just thinking some interesting Dust in the Wind like we here for a moment 20 years 30 years of war and all the sudden blurred vision to get mantras get chanted into their ear at the time of death very interesting stuff okay that's the way and all right so here we are text 20 and this is prologue offering prayers
 these Baki prayers it's not like gimme gimme gimme
 that is sort of like how I grew up Rain gimme gimme gimme I need some more it's just a devotion and devotion is gratitude and you have gratitude something interesting happens you get anyway
you get what you want when you have gratitude my dear Lord everyone in this material world is under the modes of material nature
 being influenced by goodness passion ignorance from the greatest personality Lord Vermont a small ant Works under the influence of that they all work under the influence of these three modes so what does that mean let's try to capture that very quickly type of body and a type of mind that have desires and they're carved out by material nature from previous desires and so all this Karma acts almost as like some you know some Celestial Puppeteer we're in the piers we have free will but I'm still going for what the instincts of my body want and and those what my mind want and those are shaped example I was born into an Italian-American New York body is it karma that comes
and I have passions that sort of go with that I have a bloodline that comes with that and because of that my passions are carved out the certain way or I think I'm making a choice yet I could be making some choice because I've had an addictive bloodline for many many generations and now it appears like I'm making some choice but I'm acting on some almost base Instinct that's controlled by material nature
 yeah but you can say that I mean yeah all that all that I would say like there is subtle influences
 right yeah that that are working through our minds
 as we connect with anything in this world anything material in this world that every object that were Weatherby a sound Weatherby is something that we see or touch the places that were at the people that were associating with that
the music that we hear the food that we eat these Yogi's understood your head again that's a same same as yesterday bro wrote about this so that we could understand it that in one sense all of these we set it out the other day not long ago I think just like a screen has pics pixels that are like three different colors in them in certain ways and they can make all sorts of colors and in all sorts of images so these Yogi said that this world is made up of three different energies epic or Jurassic temasek Energies
 they planned it all kind of ways and the crate forms and the forms are every form is made out of a blend of these three energies but the influence of one of the energies predominates it and radiates from it and subtly defects like you're saying or decision-making it is true that we have free will but it becomes filtered through this these influences and it only
I'm very aware these influences do you stand a chance of becoming truly free otherwise we're kind of getting dragged around we can't ride around like a dog sniffing around and the way you explained it so nice because it sounds like oh I get it this is scientific process you put this into the filter it's going to make everything up here red give me a kiss filter on everything is blue and one when I when I first started bhakti yoga on Krishna Consciousness everything at that point made sense this is why I don't want to eat at a restaurant because that that food is going to affect my Consciousness a certain this is why I don't want to eat these particular food cuz could affect my conscious they're all going to be different filters this is why I don't associate with this or these people or that type of that type of talk the Monday in idle talk or or people who speak of degrading things this is why I'm not going to let this in my Consciousness cuz it's creating me where at
when I was younger and I would see like a nun on the subway I was thinking what a lousy life she's living with you go out take that what's that called a habit habit Habit to take that have it off let your hair down you know go to go to the drag races tonight have some fun attract that's what we do at Upstate New York going to the races
 yes it so the yoga's are saying
 we may not know it
 but in a sense we're in a realm where our mind is acceptable to outside influences and that you know the clarity of our thinking is being altered by these influences did the intensity of our desires are motions they're all being influenced by we all kind of know that if I go here I may feel like that or when I go
were there I think more like that sure know that's why I don't watch certain movies are you kidding if I watch one murder movie I am like the baseball bats and axes hit in my house will double I'll double it I'll have extra accident I'll just think everyone's out to kill me at every minute if I look around at people who's the murderer here that stuff like that when I engage my mind in like True Crime stuff forget it I'm ready I'm ready to fight everybody off self again
 what what is your guys are saying is that these three influences the one influences makes us more clear and Lucid in in simple and satisfied one influence makes it kind of like desire more like I'm not satisfied I'm not content that I need to achieve more cheap something that I don't have to be satisfied and one influence is more like I'm just
darker like more and more destructive you know it goes towards laziness or destruction that every object that I'm in countering these three are woven into it and it every circumstance that I'm moving around this world it's affecting me the yoga saying I need to rise above that I need to become very conscious of it I need to learn how to how to not be a victim of it but how to pass through in the most intelligent way so prolonged speaking to that here he said he will come here so I can show you the the Armory that is super Soul Farm the weapons okay my dear Lord everywhere in this material world is every one of them everyone in this material world is under the modes of material nature being influenced by goodness passion ignorance
 everyone the greatest personality Lord for my heart to believe, is also down there so yeah
Aunt Works under the influence of these has these motives are for everyone this material world is influenced by your energy the cause for which they work the place where they work the time when they work
 right now the matter due to which they work the goal of Life they have considered final that's a good goal of your life so I think of the goal in the process for obtaining the school what am I going to do to get there all the wind of your energy indeed since the energy and the energetic identical all of them are but manifestations of you a lot in a sense it's almost like a lawyer or someone writing like a PhD thesis that's just constructing an hour
in a sense yeah right cuz this is going to lead to like I'm sitting here struggling in this world and we just saw the person that seemed to be the best at manipulating the material energy for his own enjoyment go down in the most gruesome way time you know now everything that I had is now Dust in the Wind
 and ends were understanding that the entire world is functioning
 by your by your direction so if I want you to wear all kind of getting crushed by time
 if I want to transcend it I should look to you right because all of this is indeed your energy okay so he's building an argument in a sense I asked you to a question
 sounds just not too too much of a squirrel now it's not YouTube are you going to
 did you pray cuz do the when you were growing up did you pray a lot not a lot
I mean maybe at some point not really married to people not so much
 you're like an altar boy praying all right interesting yet you're very religious now now you always pray interesting anyway I just curious that's that's all we have to do God I pretty much always but I don't think us through the engage in prayer I didn't really know what to why didn't you I just I just again I just might my warrant. Mine was up there with the bird people I was just praying I was praying for stopped that's all just give me stuff please like like Amazon Prime you know okay my dear oh Lord oh Supreme Eternal by expanding your plenary portion you have created the subtle bodies of the living entities through the agency of your external energy which is agitated by time
 that's the mind in traps
a living entity in unlimited varieties of desires is what I talked about earlier like it's a fever unlimited varieties of desires to be fulfilled by the beta directions of karma kunda fruit of activity in the 16 elements
 past who can get who can get free from this entanglement unless he takes shelter of your Lotus feet and he's further developing the argument. So he's saying goodbye expanding your planner reapportion
 you have created the subtle bodies of the living entities through the agency of your external energy which is agitated by time so he sang the world that we live in even the bodies that were in there all ingredients ingredients just like a battery have a batter
 and that battle just sit there like batter until it's agitated right you could say it's like the yeast or you could say is like the Heat
he transforms into begins to take a certain shape
 and you saying all of this is your all the ingredients or your energy and then with the power of the element of time time is like the Heat or time is like the Eastwood however you want to call it and it makes it take on different shapes so takes on the shape of our bodies it takes on the shape of the world that we live in
 it's all your stuff and then you even provide them then in order to fulfill that is that you know I've been I've been listening to a lot of these
 YouTube videos about like philosophers talking about especially you can let these Christian philosophers or usually their Christian philosophers it's funny because it's like there's a lot of content I'll do this like Christian philosopher speaking with atheist sure yep and I just always liked guys there are answers to these questions
Karma pretty much know if it clears the whole thing up it's amazing how it's like will you just listen to The Hairy krishnas for a moment please you both feel like they they struggle and they they play with these ideas like well if God is good and God doesn't want us to suffer then why doesn't he just tell everybody what to do it will be jobless you don't sit in the Bible you but not everybody's read the Bible what about the people before the Bible if you don't like and that's where you should come and say slow down down but but
 the idea that this is a little bit more a little less simplistically ideas that we want to live separately from God it's and he's fulfilling our desire to do so we have free will cuz free Willis is a vital
ingredient are vital aspect of love which is the very purpose of all existence so if we're going to love eternally we're going to need to have free will and if we have free will that means that you might engage in any way that you want so certain living beings among this unlimited totality of living beings have the desire that I want to enjoy separately from the Creator separately from Mysore separately from the Divine I want to experiment as if I were an independent living thing that is not
 intrinsically connected to its phase Adams yes it's okay but I know you have rules mom but I am on my own now and even though they're not stay there for Krishna
expanse is through his plenary portions creates the subtle bodies of the living entities
 creates all the external energy agitated with the element of time so that it's all moving now
 and provides here saying it provides evaded directions to Carmax Honda it provides it if he provides the sacred texts that are saying if you want to try to you could go through the second the parents on t.j. teenager you could go through it like a blind idiot and really suffer or if you want to live separately and let me give you some advice about how you might do it better and that's it and knowing that it's good for their character knowing that it's it's for their well-being that's the karma come to that's the section of The Vedas it says here's how to enjoy the material world in a intelligent way that's harmonious with nature with God in the gods and goddesses in all of that it'll be
living separately from your source is something that you got to mature from but it's a healthier way to go so he provides the karma kind of teachings and all exactly like raising teenagers it's just cuz you get to a certain point where they want some Independence have some teenagers are really submissive it's rare but there's trying to find themselves are very submissive and you lay down certain rules and this is this is how you can do it you can not go off the tracks here you will protect yourself from the train wrecks that you see so many teenagers go through and some will take it seriously but most a lot of times they won't be created a culture where were where attempts people off the tracks brings them right to the edge of brink of disaster and then and if you're a parent that cares and wants to love them you'll give them some what's the word some you give them guidelines but you'll give them some for you
 guardrail Street like that like concession you'll give him a
are you listening okay I know you guys like to stay up late what do you say you come back by 11 on Friday night okay I think that's out there and they are dominated by whatever your karma is really one of your mind is at we were influences are at you have to learn the hard way she got to give them some concessions so they can so you can still have some so you can still leave them in The Vedas give that concession you got desires we could you can try this Vedic formula you got some other desires you can try worshipping these day Bazaar JB's you got this and so it is like that and in so we have stumbled upon
 pure devotional service and even with a devotional service we get it we still might need a concession it like like are some of our questions were this weekend in the queue and AJ there still might be some concern
I get it but still still okay that's okay here's what you can do
 la vaquita so again in building this argument he's saying you've created this energy so that we can go and play independently in it but it's very powerful
 if we're going if we're going to experience this world as separate from you we need to be an illusion because nothing separate from you if we're going to feel like we're the controllers were really going to be need to be an illusion and once you go into that Illusions hard to get out there's a lot of suffering and it's difficult to get out so plotting how did how does one get out without turning back to you right now, take me under the protection of your Lotus feet like that 22 my dear Lord those Supreme great you have created this material world of 16 constituents does each ingredient that were talking about the get agitated by time but
you are Transit rentals of them to their material qualities you're not of them you're not for your not time doesn't affect you the three modes you're not influenced by those you're beyond it all in other words these material qualities are under your full control and you were never conquered by them there for the time element is your representation my dear Lord oh Supreme no one can conquer you as for me however I've been crushed by The Wheel of Time oh yes we are and therefore I Surrender fully up to you now kindly take me under the protection of your Lotus feet okay there's the heavy statement right he saying if we're really you know this is what it sound like Dust in the Wind is meant to help you I'm trying to build things but all my dreams
 I thought this was I thought this was a really heavy line here
 this is all my dreams pass before
Liza curiosity there's there's moment especially as you get older there's really profound moments where you realize everything like I imagine this is what a divorce is like where this is what
 I don't know you you this point in our life we have to walk through a door and not turn back and then and then you becoming accustomed to another life and marriage is like that moving from one place to another and change the homes going any like you'll never go in that apartment again
 right it's like it's you used to identify live in it and then you remove from it and you look at it like it used to be your life an ounce of Curiosities like you are going back and visiting a childhood home so I can wow
 wow they're like it and then when something is dear to you and it becomes so meaningful to you
and then time removes you from it then you're like I'm getting crushed by this wheel it's a wheel that keeps moving keeps rolling
 and whatever I have whatever I try to build whenever I try to hold on to it just gets crushed
 like that all right did you read that whole verse did I read it all yeah
 yes that's one of my dear Lord people in general want to be elevated to the higher planetary systems for a long duration of Life maybe not anymore maybe they don't get that but they do want people are are into these longevity herbs and things like that long time to hire planetary systems for a long duration of Life opulence and enjoyment but I have seen all of these through the activities of my father right
his father owned everything such a powerful version the bottle to get a Brahma Blue Banana Loca you know this you know albertino Arjuna from the highest Planet the material world to the lowest Planet they're all places of suffering why why is the highest Planet a place of suffering cuz you have to leave it you have to give it up it's just like saying congratulations you're staying at the Four Seasons you got the best room but you got to check out by 11 tomorrow it's like Big D it's not that you can't hang you can't hang pictures you know don't get too comfortable there you're there for a night this is the material world so he sees his father his father at everything even the demigods are working for his father and now he's gone and everything's dust when my father was angry and he laughed sarcastically at the demigods they were immediately back was simply by seeing the movements of his eyebrows so he is he was as powerful as it gets it doesn't yeah yet my father who was
powerful has now been vanquished by you within a moment
 Boombah so we're being granted here the perspective of pearl odd the perspective of someone who's personally witnessed a materialist operating at the highest level
 is its velocity as way of sharing with Humanity over the course of Millenia how to see the world let me give you the world who the vision a lot
 you may think they're still hope and material life because I just haven't operated on a high enough level
 he sang don't even think like that because I've witnessed the person that operated as the highest level materialist hranica even conquer ninja everyone was terrified he was so powerful and everything that he had just got crushed like that
he even really try he not only that he tried to put so many safeguards to his power in place I can't be killed a day or night I can't be killed indoor-outdoor I can't be killed by man or beast he thought no one's ever going to do a better job of trying to safeguard their material power
 he got they got those blessings from the creator of the universe promo so no one could ever do their job and still
 crushed immediately you know Dustin the wind like that so it's so it's itchy ass is way that the compilers of these ancient texts it's his way of of just sharing for us

 bypass that's true but if someone operated on a material Level more effectively then this could all work out now it's not going to work out
