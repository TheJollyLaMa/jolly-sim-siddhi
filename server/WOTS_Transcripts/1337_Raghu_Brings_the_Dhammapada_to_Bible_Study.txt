 make me feel good doing this podcast with you every morning Raga and Mara and I want to keep you know we're really excited up here Bunky's up here we got my up here we've got about to tee up here and more people are starting to trickle in and we're just getting excited for the model, not there he comes in there he's got the dreadlocks on he's got the tattoos but more than that
 he's got like deep meditation kind of meditative quality to him right at the meditative kirtan if you have dreadlocks in your thinking hey I want to become a Harry Krishna can I do that a lot. There's hope things go for you a couple back there and leave a couple back there any long I think of the old days I think we'll like I like this box stuff and I'm going to cut off my hair you know what I mean
is that is always another way to go it's just grow the dreadlocks the point was you going to minimize the attention to it right well the it inside and real-world I think if you join that a Harry Krishna Temple it was sort of like you were shame your hair shamed yeah what you know I think traditionally you said now dreadlocks with a fashionable but like tradition was just like it was like an anti-fashion kind of things just like I know you were going to call me I think people like who just got criticized for having them because they say it's a black thing is cultural appropriation it's like if you come pick it up if you don't really appropriate his sheep
 Hindu literature
we got an answer from there she's all cued up at noon and 1:30 and tomorrow for our supporting members we have an awesome Feel Good Friday with Josh Cain at 10:30 a.m. and people can also go to that new platform to sign up for the sage group sir there are some spaces but they're filling up really quickly how many groups are Focus Dube I think like 22 out of the 31 groups are now totally full and those other ones are going to be you know like half full of whatever so if it's a all fill up well we'll add some more but check in there get your spot and
 you know better sooner than later great you know it was speeding a culture appropriation right now. Yeah what have I done now nobody cuz
briggle Pottery we're going to have on the show with the professor how was your time with Professor it was great it was all the family was on because it's rathyatra time you know the day after I think I see what you mean is this coming Sunday in the Brooklyn Temple traditionally is like it's just like a huge massive program place is packed with maybe a couple thousand people yeah everybody's decked-out you know specially the second generation to vote if they get into it you know they're there all you know the guys that got their fancy Dodi on in the day I got to bring some pants and in the girls are all totally decked out you know they got the big fancy sorry on in the jewelry and if yes and then
I brought a g Mohan and his wife there in Jamal on AG Mohan he's actually mentioned in my book a Gmail, but not by you I would need to know how much a g mohanan is why these are like traditional brahmins South Indian Yogi's brahmins traditional to the core so people who study yoga and really got into his messages from the yoga Community AG Mohan and his wife studied with Krishna Nama charia the last years of his life was like 6 days a week from what I understand yeah 6 days a week and I mean they're looking more traditional Christian on the charger out there and so cuz scuba you host them at that you brought them to the Brooklyn krishnamacharya sister course this very important figure in the history of modern yoga especially in the west so so I brought them to the Brooklyn temp
on that day and I brought them up to the balcony
 which overlooks the whole Temple sure seen hundreds of people of every race
 all right every age
 right like all external do you want to talk about you know diverse complete them and and and there they are like in front of Sri SRI Radha Govinda being worshipped beautiful opulence write a traditional Radha Krishna Temple scene beautiful scene and then you know I believe it was ghorbani was leaving here time but you know like everybody's and you got all this went down good players and their and you know all the ladies they do those dances where they do the fancy steps and they would go with this way and then I go that way and you know they are swinging around there moping skirts and isn't in unison and everything and
and you don't incredibly powerful enthusiastic your tongue and then they had a drama Mahabharata in the Mahabharata it was like a New York mob arthritis-like did the all the actors and actresses you know the black their Puerto Rican there white there in 30 second Fleet mixture and they're watching all of this with like their jaws practically dropping and when I brought them out of there they said to me they said we knew that you're sure the probe had that he had brought back to you and to to the whole world ended and we knew that that was like a special thing but we've never seen anything like this he said he was shocked like he said this devotion you don't see in the temples of India he was he was not only approving it sure he was actually like humbled by it
 and so when people tell me about like cultural appropriation
this is exactly what the tradition wanted the tradition wanted to spread its built-in the tradition that the entire world should take advantage of these beautiful teaching said it's our it's our spiritual inheritance to do our act to Krishna through kirtan to connect to to Christian Krishna to archana to this entire body culture
 cultural appreciation brother its cultural appreciation appreciation that because I'm taking it and say yeah I made it up
 it's mine it's not weird get you give the credit back to the source that's the difference that's why I did not cultural approach in the ironic thing about the the cultural appropriation claim
 is that within the tradition there's a warped
 part of the tradition that took a beautiful tradition of unity and use it as a tool of Expo
station in other words to say I was born a Brahmin based on in the way that is Warped is this conception of birth I was born a Brahmin up there before you need to do what I say I get all the privilege no no no no it's not your birth it's your qualities right it says it's a merit-based so when so when
 when people say that like within the yoga World Western is practicing yoga pricing but you that is cultural appropriation they're actually playing right into the hands of the oppressors for saying that it's based on birth of the whole point is it's not based on birth is not based on bird Whisperer solves there is no you don't understand there is no indian-american that secondary stuff cultural Reclamation Kylie says it's it's it's it's everyone's culture reclaiming our spiritual Ness what's our our birth lineage achuta culture a squirrel born in Christmas family
I like trying to be like that about we got a special nugget a nugget is when we take something from some piece of crap's Western literature and we we draw out a commonality in Vedic teachings and we took today coming out to eat we took from Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach what an amazing story Livingston Seagull maybe some animals talking to each other you like talking animals yes I do yes I do like talking okay
 do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating or fighting or power in the flock
this is right on the back of Akita do you have any idea of how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating or fighting or power in the flock like I have very colorful dreams at night but as soon as I wake up
 I forgot them instantly if you're not traumatic or something big or something deep conversation or some Adventure what was it was just a moment ago and it's gone that's what it must be like for a toddler wear underwear before toddler like a little child trying to trying to figure out like where these new people who are the old people because there's all these new things around me makes
forget about the past
 the Run has finished the Nugget start start over, is it you must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating fighting for power in the flock thousand live John 10,000 we choose our next world through what we learn in this one what a bird story we choose our next world through what we learn in this one sometimes sometimes parents suffer tremendously doing everything they possibly could to raise their kids and the kid just doesn't turn out how you wanted to turn out
 can't believe you went this way I would thought he was going to go that way and you know what
 Murray's in a cantaloupe and we want a watermelon
have their own Karma they have to go through a cantaloupe cantaloupes themselves but you're hoping for a watermelon it's not going to happen. Going to happen to have their own Karma that got to work through take it you're going to affect them somewhat but you're not going to recreate then why because they took this berth for particular reason and there's lessons they have to learn we all get some jail time you send this yesterday in the material world to learn to grow from to purify herself to rectify ourselves and sometimes and we see that it's a lot there so many lessons we get on a regular basis for a listen to podcast it's only lessons we get in our reading
 on a regular basis but
 how many do I actually let sit with me and how many not do I sit with me but I care how many more like Harry with me tomorrow or next week or next year
5 years old I kind of lesson but I'm not going to let it go so these are all deep tread changing lessons were getting in the Bog matam how to become a different person in five years and years and years and twenty years from now or will I just let them go and go back to the patterns that I've inherited you know from a bloodline of family lineage is fighting in the power of the flock arguing and complaining give me the person who just complains all the time and sometimes we inherit that from my parents we inherit sort of sharp sharpness sometimes Irish temper I've got two people say things like this I guess what we are not our blood line and don't submit yourself to that identity it is not you you can transcend that bloodline through a practice of spiritual life
 there you go
you know it's such a this this conception or hit one bird speaking to the other one's saying that we're taking birth again and again to learn something about life that the lot this kind of like a logic an ontological kind of logic to that you know that that was so appealing when I first got into talk to you when I first Congress cuz when I first read Bhagavad Gita one of my friends were telling me about
 when we would discuss these kind of things you know because I think maybe was similar with you where I cannot overhear that that that and you can tell me but like I see my whole face go like this back home to figure out like you are done with your monologue and you're gone
 fastest way
do is send me that list I sent you that clip whether you and I were teenagers in our GM 20 years old or whatever
 and we were hearing about Foxy and put we're searching I think I know I did I would imagine you did we saw a certain Beauty in Christianity certain Beauty in Jesus's teachings sure will you like that but it was a Christian there you go but there would like these kind of it but if you put it in approaching it as a thinker as a questioner so there seemed to be a logical fallacies not exactly not I would say not exactly what Jesus was teaching or embodying Butler
what the church was kind of presenting what they were taken out of it like it's like here's a fallacy right like Original Sin
 everyone is born sinful that's a heart born sinful God created
 human beings
 looks like perfect like Adam and Eve but they ruined it for everyone like they sent everybody simple forever yeah and so you now did like they're now all the descendants of these two people through one-act they've all become ruins that they're all guilty of Sin from birth it's like so it really feeds into myself and then in it and then the answer to that is that God sends himself
 as a sacrifice
 to himself
so that to satisfy himself
 in order to save others
 from the torture that he himself would inflict on them
 for the sins that they are forced to commit by his design is I suppose you can believe that but doesn't it make more sense that we're all responsible for ourselves that we've been given freedom
 to choose how we want to live that there are lessons that were meant to learn that we get another chance to learn it that there's an idea of karma that yes we do suffer and we all know that suffering is not that I'm not dude do suffering because someone else send you no back of the beginning
creation and I became as soon as I made this decision myself and and or you don't like then the logical fallacy like hell you know the second credibly disproportional response I'm a limited being and I perform limited soon
 but I get an unlimited torturous torturous punishment yeah like once when I was a kid I stole a pack of gum I was just putting hits on so many people so we're going to the same place yes or you know like send their society of like and I think it's not a royal and I go on like similar or she or he can do it all he has to do is accept not even try to change but just accept
 that Jesus died for sins of him
I'm not saying that that's exactly the Bible said no to be Christian say no that's not how it went but that's how it was taught to us yeah yeah and it just seems like all so it's just seems like how am I supposed to love God is it is fear-based like every ever made a parent maybe your parents like those your papa like everybody's scared of your dad and you're scared of your dad my dad got to get a little scary and so you just like how to behave in fear of getting like super punished and so is that love or is that just like this psycho Authority and authoritarian Dynamic what God is going to punish you almost like almost irresponsibly and it's not for the what you've done it unlimited torture unlimited torture it like stand in the corner forever
 and it have your toenails pulled out forever pliers what can I do to okay I made a mistake what can I do to rectify it you can't you can never wrecked who they
too late what kind of loving God is that yeah it's like sadism and we're supposed to try to fall in love with that makes so much more sense and yes we suffer but we always have the freedom to turn back to a loving God right round unlimited to my guests again this isn't a Christian but I think a lot of these abrahamic religions cuz they teach it in such an exclusive way you got to surrender to God actually am finding more inspiration through my 12-step program or they're going to help program saved you
 isn't there other saviors
 right left not from Judas Mission will I know that's what they would say they would say there's one savior but we're experiencing hell on Earth and sometime you're kind of Savior yourself right
if you give some trash that's in the house to someone and you save them from Hell on Earth you're their savior but will do say that you did cancel that only Jesus can save you from 90 and we say if you do if you deliver truth you can offer our savior your savior become a savior today
 about you actually
 you don't have to get soap up because we don't think that deeply about it you know another one that it was just like come on guys was like this idea of being reunited with your loved ones and Heaven that's weird I mean I want to see everybody old is a point it's like well if a baby dies is a is it a baby in heaven or is everybody the same age or no one of the dogs got a dog have in full mother he said to go to dog heaven if what if the baby didn't have the opportunity to choose Jesus as its savior more than the best thing to do is kill the baby
go to heaven are you sure so it just you know there was no at muggia so here's my point is that you know that the teachings of the Gita in the box and they had you know and they done to maguana understanding the nature of the stuff that we're all Eternal Sparks of spiritual energy it makes so much more sense it's not that when you go to vaikunta or the spiritual world that you re born in the same body and they're all looking at each other and recognizing know you or you know you've gone through many bodies you know as we pass through this world that's not our identity get together understand the distinction that the audmar has its Eternal I'd any that has nothing to do with the body that you're in temporarily that is a consistent clear you no idea you know I still stand with this if you really want
understand the Bible study the bug of agita said if you want to be a better Christian
 listen to the podcast and regular basis we're not interested in you joining some Hindu Club this isn't like a Hindu nationalist thing this is understanding relationship with God and love and devotion and understanding yourself and self I become a better Christian
 well you weren't that great from but if you read my book college going to my Christian Club know I had it. Doubt the omnipod go to Southern Connecticut University is that southern Connecticut I never heard of this University sure that's a real University fabricated it just for the bus Southern is called
nothing to do with you I kind of like going to yell except except without any of the qualifications and it's much cheaper and the professors are substandard and then they had a Christian Club means nothing Christian Club then you went and checked it out I was a card-carrying member of the Christian Club because I was straight edge I was ready to Therrien and I wanted good Association I did a little the dorms I love you a bunch of Jelly's at a house and I would I would go there cuz I knew the importance of good Association and I would go to New York City on the weekends and you know that's where we started our record company in New Haven me and my friend Jordan and yeah and it was great I appreciate it I appreciate it the piety they accepted me even though I was Punk and a little crazy looking they were really normal-looking Christian guys but I was
Milan kill people dress like they did good things they distributed food I didn't do that because they distribute meets but I went to like the hospitals and sing Christmas carols to the elderly and those who couldn't get out of the hospital in the holidays and we did about it like highest things with you we have a group meeting a prayer meeting this is why I was learning I was doing that okay Mr you will you know what your good works won't do anything for you down the pot and I said I think you're going to level up it's very parallel to our own eyes. I think you're going to a war within that Christian they were like we don't read other books outside this yeah we need to speak about this right
 anyway cause a whole day I'm not going to get into it it's in my book but it's a funny exchange we had and it at that point I realized that
I want to hear about a man read the book yet and if so what will it will then I just said hey I was just in New York City was my turn to share up in the Christian Circle 20 speak like I said do they give you like a stick when it's time for you to speak now this isn't like Lord of the Flies
 yeah we just answer like I'd hit you almost like a twelve-step meetings or a circle you're sharing your inspiration about God and I said why I went to New York City this weekend and I go to this book store called Wiser's and it's all these books on metaphysics and spirituality in Christ Consciousness and I got this book called down the pot I think you guys are really going to like it it's parallel teachings to Jesus and and and all of a sudden like everybody turned pale and the leader of the group said while Ray this is a Bible study we prefer we just
stick to the Bible and I am just like in Vern what you and I was like a little muscle but I passed I passed and then someone else spoke and instead of and you're not allowed to like cross talk and, then somebody else is inspiration because you know I'm glad you stopped in because so many people I have been misled by Buddhism and have been cheated and are going to hell and then I had to like raise my hands like wait a second you haven't even read the book how could you say that he's teaching the exact same thing we live in a world where your always trying to find a difference why don't you find some commonality of these teachings they're always going to be different rituals and it's always going to give her hair cut out what do we have in common. Speaks about compassion and you can speak about empathy
he speaks about in you know about nonviolence like why I talked about Jesus quotes that they did they put the way the truth the life no one gets her Godfather but to me right back with this quote by boo'd up so yeah Buddhist is the same thing Buddha says the same thing there is no true Superior to know is the great ocean except through me
 a narrative essay that's a false Doctrine and then the back of the Gita says there is no true Superior to me so you're like everything rest everything rests upon me as pearls are strong and so I said here we have three old books they all say something different now instead of fighting over this and by the way then
I just quoted redate your book
 my point is this instead of finding out how they're all difference they're all books of wisdom want to figure out what they have in common creature either but I had to leave that group because I felt like I feel like I'm reading the Bible I'm getting inspiration from this Bible but you guys are reading into this in a different way you're making it very exclusive and you're seeing everybody is others and I understand you might need to do that for your own edification but you got to be careful because in that you could become hateful of people that are not like you even spiritual people even evolve people there's evil people who are don't practice your particular religious path
 I'm with you are going to I'm with you as a matter of fact that's what I'm writing right now you know has a lot to do with that that this idea of
who's evolve spiritually
 that there's kind of a model of evolution from I approach God for the things of this world to I want to transcend this world
 to I'm only interested in Divine love and we see that progression of that evolution in all the different world Traditions all the different spiritual Traditions practically all so so it doesn't it's not so much a question of what tradition you're in it's a question of how we evolved you've come to Divine love
 I need those are the highest things I'm still thinks even of this world of of you meet someone from another spiritual tradition and you just see they have a you're right you're you're talking about like the highest thing okay what door are you going to choose hear you're speaking of a connection when people are very very liberated they're up there over the material world do you want 11
some people are coming because they want the things this material world that's the less evolved sure then some people want to transcend this world for their own peace yeah that's still more evolved
 but it's not the full evolution of our spiritual potential to the fullest is love anyway maybe you let us see our commonality and what we're saying right now. I see only the difference cuz do only the difference in the musketeer. I'm driving right now I'm on Dave and Sarah's what team do you have some that don't you help me. Before I sign the sheet my bag of time which is our very means Conquest Wichita prospective obeisance used to this reward Narayan until we see the Super Bowl she would be the author
top priorities for badri soon if somebody is in the back of tongue and my rendering Services a devotees all that is troublesome the heart we can eradicate it and loving service to the Supreme Lord it was raised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh my God it's about on this yeah yeah yeah Jacks you don't mean the dumb game I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are open in my eyes that sort of knowledge I offer obeisance at their Lotus like feet reading for the shoe box with Tom Canto 7 chapter 10 txt 36 36
 let's get into this okay now who's speaking now we're going on for this we need to be clear about this is just like an hour later I think
 what's the narrator who's the narrator I believe now we are at
speaking to you to steer yes being cursed by the brahmins the same two Associates took birth again as kumbhakarna and a 10 headed Robin these two Russians were killed by Lorde ramachandra extraordinary power he's going a back story we just talked about the killing of a run your cashew Pooh who was already got you poo he and his brother Herman yakshe were these actually these Spiritual Beings that made some offense and had to take 3 birth first they were first they can't
 yes first they came as they came in as hiranyaksha and then Ravenna and kumbhakarna then she should Paul and I know I guess he's giving a l i get it I get I get it because this is Sage group or not say his group sagelink level whatever it is is he's he's he's reflecting back on the store
the killing of her and Akashi poo and he's these Divine beings had to take birth Rebirth of demons and he was saying all of the and everybody out there should know these three it was should you pound of acrobats in Christmas Lila they were killed they took Brothers demons were killed Dan in ramachandra is Lila Moore first and Freddie Mac's in the further back where we just read from was her Antioch run yakshe and hiranyakashipu so they were demons with a backstory
 but they were devotees when you go the whole way back to the beginning of the store and that's why there's a box yeah that's what we can't hate the stupid because everybody and that's why there's this whole Christian thing I do a Christian thing or just a philosophical thing
 are people born Evil Within Christianity they say
I like the devil is that what that's the thing right stronger than God is is is there just one is got state in the only evil battle during on Battle going on can just got every living being what we called Pure sociology it were all pure underneath but we have these warped Minds so yeah yeah I mean I could cultivate a real demonic mind if I wanted to and that means I embrace lust I embraced greed I embrace you know violence you become demonic it's not hard and then you can change most of us have been there right now
 there is very dark past with Meredith
 yeah and you know that and that's how this thing about this rug enough to waste like as we were learning this kind of stuff we're also learning that it's not that you just have to accept this stuff blindly
is that okay here's the philosophy right that we are it begins with this Ava magana understanding that we are all Sparks of spiritual energy that our Eternal over here other than that over here that we're all Hollis part of Eternal spiritual Angie and you don't have to just you can try to understand that because how so you're not your body observe your body that you're not you're mine gr of your mind feel the distinction between yourself and your mind yourself and your body under feel yourself as the as the Observer behind will realize that you've been through many bodies in one life and if that's the case then certainly you must not be the body you know cuz you've been in a child's body with it all the cells that compose that body are gone now and some other form now your body composed of new energy you've been through them all it means I'm not the body I mean I can sit here and watch my mind it means I'm not my mind
I must be the spark and it seems like I'm not affected by the change of the body okay bug of agita starting to make some sense of it so it wasn't it was saying feel this contemplate this it was interesting believe this you're going to go to hell it was saying here's a very nuanced and consistent philosophy contemplated think about experiment with it and if you do if it starts to trickle in all the pain of this material world will slowly be really why because our fears are anxieties our worries are all based on his conception that I am this shell and Michelle is fragile and it's going to break and everybody I love their shell is going to break and I can't hold on to anything and everything that I have everything that I love and everything I work for slipping through my fingers like a turtle is that she'll breaks breaks it's over it so the thing is when I went to start stuff to actually sink in the fever of material Life Starts to reduce dramatically
Bieber Bieber
 Pierce by the arrows of Lord Rama Chandra both kumbhakarna and Ravenna lay on the ground and left their bodies fully absorb and thought of the Lord and then amazing that was Lynda Carter and Robin kumbhakarna and Robin is a demon's absorbed in the Lord more drama than the thought of the Lord just as they have done in their previous lives that's how I'll come as ramachandra rescue Sita with a with the most intense battle and who's he battle against ultimately go back to Giant Pizza these are his devotees
 in the spiritual realm who come to play to battle
so that he can relish the taste
 of that play but wait there's more okay they both took birth again in human society as shishupal powerful King in Santa Barbara this was during Christian is Lila and continued in the same enmity towards the Lord and it is they who merged into the body of the Lord in your presence okay so this is your was there just happened while you just year was actually I think it was at the moment that it happened you just your turn to Nardin said what just happened is going through this big coronation to become the emperor and then I don't want no brakes this was he was already a but he was doing the Rogers who you are as a right to bring auspiciousness to the kingdom
 yeah yeah yeah it wasn't his coronation it was around.
so is it was just to reclaim his
 claiming his power was just part of the it was to do a ritual that brings auspiciousness to the kingdom but a very difficult one to perform very difficult and he was there and are all the kings came but then a little scuffle broke out in the crowd next thing you know you were talking and consulted words were getting screamed and it was like an awkward it's almost like at graduation something weird happens you know I should have liked it some guy is takes off the robe in there streaking some some weird thing happens at graduation and make something very official and beautiful go crazy in this is sort of what happened at you and you just you're so sweet and humble and then all of a sudden Krishna gets up with sitting very peacefully and he he calls his sudarshan chakra and Heathrow
step ahead of shirt you bought it at Sophos add people scream there's fights break out and you just your and then when he dies people people witness the soul enter into krishna's body and you just yours like what just happened and he just got the results that like that these Yogi's get after lifetimes of trying to meditate on Godwin a favorable mood it is Kaiser Senior set-up and cursed Krishna out hundred times a hundred times and liberated I know what what's going on so that's when the whole this whole can't do is just been building that you know that question answering that question why why does he get it next this next verse really gets to the point on that road by the Postal Service. Abilities who is that an unknown but also many many other kings who acted as enemies of Krishna
attain salvation at the time of death because they thought of the Lord they receive spiritual bodies and forms that informs the same as his just as were captured by a black drone drone is like a wasp was just as worms captured by a black drone so what is that the same type of body as the drill in the state your own I guess a worm this is this is it's it's an analogy that you always have used going way back forever so the worm is looking at the at his trapped in a corner and he has to take birth is at washed because he's meditating on the wall cuz that let let let this to say this warm is like in a hole in the wall
 and the WASP like it's got a little nest in that right it's got a little place of living worm family and then the the WASP comes in at holders No Escape because there's only one
through the wasp in the WASP is so much more powerful and dangerous than the worm and the worm now is realizing death is coming to me in the form of this wasp and it's powerful as terrified and it's King and his mind is just in Tire Lee absorbed in the W so that you always are in the yoga saying then it takes its next birth as a wasp because whatever you're meditating on deeply determines your next Bertha for now in the purple dragon. She'll probably just going to share the mystery of yogic meditation aren't you reading
 39 the mystery of yogic meditation is explained here real Yogi's always meditate in the form of Lord Vishnu within their hearts consequently don't teach that in a yoga class do they know they're like intention
 how you do
no one says no yoga teacher in America says okay they're going to meditate on Lord Vishnu in the heart right now so you can take your next birth with a four on the form consequently the time of death they give up their body is well thinking of the form of Lord Vishnu and I should take this new logo or frequent the look up where they received buggers around where their bodily features the same as those of the Lord from the 6 can't do we have already learned that when the Vishnu do just came from my Quinta to deliver ajamil the jhamil they looked exactly like this new with four hands in the same features as word this new therefore we may conclude that if one practices thinking of Vishnu and it's fully absorbed and thinking of him at the time of death one returns home back to godhead even enemies and Krishna who thought of Krishna and beer such as can come see
 received bodies in a spiritual identity similar to that of
Lorde
 so there you go there's the mystery of yogic meditation right what you meditate on determines your next your destination and so therefore these Yogi's that had such discipline yoga discipline they were bringing their mind to the form of Lord Vishnu knowing that that was like the pathway
 to to transcend the transgender the material realm but the really Advanced yogis the really evolved Yogi's they did it in the mood of Love I'd like to I like to briefly talk about meditation we tend to think I'm going to be in chest is a meditational practice like a real cage meditation timer 10 minutes in the morning or 20 minutes of sitting you know what else is meditation listening to music all about the lyrics that you sing careful because it's a meditation the things that you repeat in your mind and
the races are a meditation you know what I think is also meditation Runner what and I think most people he's a really good training not to do this
 fantasizing
 in the mighty sizing that's like masturbation well that's involves fantasy right and yeah but like very strong pain medication I don't know what women's version is but men's is like that they also have fantasies different though I think it's different different but it's also similar it's more similar than it is different that's why the commonalities and the idea. But whenever I lock something in my mind just singing along to something fantasizing about things resentment and revenge
deep meditations on your mind like like her both scenarios if I had another chance I'd say this I'd show them like that concept of Revenge that's a type of meditation the pictures that we have on our walls at home the artwork that we have on our walls at home meditation is a meditation right is a meditation when it was painted and then it's transferred into your mind because your meditation right so we can be there powerful helpful tool or destructive to all either way he wants a painting up with a guy with a warped minds and their home and I had to transfer into my mind through my eyes sometimes disturbing pieces of art or sometimes people will get the city or something to sponsor some I remember
