 this was the truth maybe like what because he brought this one on the chat board the other day but I didn't realize it
can't you to here's your question I just had a chat board is not the best place to read your question if you want to get a chance to better to write the wisdom of the ages when we to gmail.com or post it in the van but the one we found it and it was good to have to speak louder how about. You see yesterday when I was louder than you you're serious
 are we ever going to fix yourself hard to figure out what that means married to Young everyone north of 50 is like laughing right now everyone south of 50 is like
 smart where's the OK Google
I hate
 involuntarily you don't want to hate but you got that you know it's not good for you know it's not good for you and you want to let it go but still it recurs destroying your peace of mind is there a technique that can be applied to change this this is going to be good I want to hear kestutis techniques and then I'll share my techniques are you want me to go first I had a few thoughts it's an important question that we've been talking a lot about this lately and I think we just read this fantastic versus yesterday right where is saying that
 there's no higher Dharma than letting go of all animosity toward it every living being like that's you know you your rituals in your traditions and all that this purpose is that you let go of animosity towards are living beings cuz you're seeing God and everyone so it's really Central to spiritual practice
but we might be feeling it right spells around this election time
 so I thought the first thing we can do is you know who identify what is the stimulus that makes us that stirs up these feelings in us you know and then you want to limit your exposure to that stimulus most like I mean you know in most cases we can't you know
 I know you know what I'm stuck watching 24-hour news cycle you know what like my old my my Instagram thread is just loaded with this kind of stuff
 you know the other more than you again what do we say marinate deer your mind in that marinate your mind in hate in the hate marinate marinate
 so so you want to limit your exposure to a steam it the stimulus of it
 but how about this
 you rather than just say I hate that person
 take a little time identify the quality
and that person
 that you hate identify what is it about that bus that pieocracy I just can't take it or you know whatever my P then search within yourself
 for even a trace of that quality right how can we be feeling such intense feelings about someone else having probably one it's still in us on any level like a good one I like it okay now here's another one and this one for me this is where I really like to go especially
 zoom out
 zoom out and consider
 it over the course of we don't know how many lifetimes
 we're all shipping through varieties of bodies and varieties of mindsets
 some of these might sets that that we've had ourselves or more warped and others and I'm not
images in this life although it is in this life but even in previous Lives who knows what we believed who knows what convictions we hold on to who knows how that affected our Behavior
 it's kind of safe to assume that we've been through all kind of work no more of my attention this is really important that this idea that underneath these changing bodies and underneath the changing mindsets
 is the Eternal pure spark of spiritual energy in with within that spark
 it's Nature's very Natures Eternal nature is dormant love
 for Krishna in dormant love for every living being a how can you hate that person you can't hate that person
 you know how can I how can we judge people
 for not exhibiting that love fully to others
 when we're not feeling it for them
that so does he know there's a logic to that and it's really there's if you have faith in this then you have to follow that you have to live by it you know we use I think was a few weeks ago we use this example of like if you have a light bulb that's just pure white light
 and then you play say you know some colored glass in front of that and you're seeing the light bulb through the glass and let if the glasses red colored then the light bulb is going to Pure read to you in the light that gives off is going to be reddish
 but it's not the the the light bulb is not the issue it's the red glass it's making it read if you don't like red light you can't blame the light bulb you got to blame the glass and simile when we feel hate for someone is not them that we should have any animosity towards it's their warped mindset that is the problem but underneath in your end in this lifetime
we must asbaty Oggi's learn to see every living being
 on that spiritual level that I'm not seeing the color glass I'm seeing the light behind it that's that's where I'm focused and it's not going to be easy we think that's going to be easy now that's going to be challenging do we think that that state of awareness that state of Krishna Consciousness that pure spiritual awareness is something that can be cheap know it's going to be tested and here's your test that person you're feeling hate for that's the person that you need to see underneath the Warped mindset and recognized as my brother right that's my sister that's that's that's a that's a spark of spiritual energy as pure as any other one out there
 and got try to love him
 I like that it's my thoughts are going to like to hear yours I felt hate even while practicing
a devotee humiliating to say
 I can tell you what back to more humiliating overcome all my problems matter fact when we make it get when we yeah when we make a dedicated commitment
 I want to be a devotee of Lord Krishna that's basically telling Krishna like okay stir up the pot let let's see what I got in there and it would be nice if I would have spirituality wish I could snap your fingers and it's like a new download and then I was nice I just put a new robe and shave my head and I've shaved away all my ego and all my anger and all my lust and all my green just doesn't work that way it's a whole process and the two times I can remember that I've dealt with it
 coming from the advice of a senior person
because I guess we all go through these challenges and Krishna before we get invited into really krishna's life closer he wants us in our cleanest warm he's always in our life but if we really want to get close to Crystal Meth start a real language this stuff immediately and completely 1 ways was that person that you're like envious of our meeting
 did deep and make it a practice
 to find their good qualities find the person that you driving you crazy and you're where you're highlighting their bad you're just sometimes use a car beautiful car with a little dent in it and all your mind goes right to the dent holy dented car but you totally Dental Well it Well then then the very default of the of the of the being is that their Spiritual Beings
if they're really dented in the really broken the really they're not evil they're doing they're doing evil but underneath that there's a spirit soul and that's our Pure Soul theology it's not like this guy is a Devil in Disguise a demon once I start thinking like this I'm not thinking like prod I got to start thinking everybody is a devotee set of it other people I'm talking to the mindset of being wealthy or the mindset of being positive of the month how about the mindset of Krishna Consciousness where everybody's actually appeared about treat everybody like a to overlook their shortcomings tolerate their shortcomings love them anyway and watch people transform instead of
 disempowering them by repeating their bad qualities to them
 right what is the object of our head is not someone that we deal with but it's more like a figure in politics or some of this
media all the time you were going there with that I was going to keep it personal cuz when I read this I was taking it personally I think it a personal one because I've seen family members and people love each other just got into a fight or something try it and they will take that to the grave and I said to the Grave because sometimes it takes something like cancer or the person is dying and they go to their bedside please forgive me and I made so many of them it's like they wasted their whole time their whole life cuz they just couldn't stay no I'm sorry and it should come those apology should come without any agenda the only agenda should be like I just want to clear my own heart and say here is what I appreciate about you so you can make actually a tangible list of what I appreciate them overlooking their shortcomings and that's very powerful sometimes we don't even appreciate
 the good qualities in people that we love and we never let them know how we appreciate them so that's it that's a 101
what is your good because of this I appreciate you because of that you do so much for me here I'm so grateful for this let people know why you appreciate them in the next thing is fine people to drive a little crazy that you're envious of the even hate and see what are their good qualities and you'll be surprised that the only thing you really hate about the person is the fact that they're not stroking your ego they often times especially with in Baki circles often times you might do things differently but they're just not stroking your ego and that's why there's some hate there something deep-rooted thing that's more like more necessarily my problem but if you start to admit that it's a real good archaeological practice is dig a Little Deeper underneath the surface and meditate on the good and you can get you can get good at this and if you get good at this it changes your whole body game the second way I've dealt with it
 is pray for the good
making a list of seeing the good making a whole tally of great qualities of these people especially like within bhakti circles people of a lot of good qualities even even your enemies so you think they're they're your enemies especially yeah just want to do good but they're doing it in a different way than you are
 you know they say that in a town in charge of Richard says that never never judge a devotee when you see to advance devotees arguing about something never never pick a side or you're condemning yourself. Sometimes he's too uptight or two fanatiker that two bodies to loose about how they never pick a side you're condemning your own spiritual life understand they're both trying out different ways to serve Lord Krishna even in wherever their set with their set and how can I serve Krishna best
 seraphic I've always thought that was so
good advice very good advice here's my next one was you pray for the person
 you pray for the person who you ended your you pray for the person that you hate Are you you pray for that person's deep spiritual connection
 and we pray for them we were sick I was saying this yesterday it's like doing the the Judo flip on my at my comes after you this person driving me crazy in person hating on you pray for them wish them well
 that's it that's it seemed simple enough because once she twerks will start to wish them good fortune you know that you would you like to continue now I was going to I was thinking as you were speaking if all of if all of our relationships or interactions are kind of smooth and pleasing
 we would never
develop determination to transcend this world we settle for this mediocrity
 there's something about
 difficulties
 that we really wouldn't begin spiritual life without them in there's something about
 material
 happiness material comfort that is deeply
 what what's the word I'm looking for
 that just kind of numbs us out to making progress
 I have a verse you rather not that I saw I came across this verse recently
 I thought is very interesting it's it's it's almost like
 backward thinking to most of us but it's really we're thinking backward you know
 he said this is what it says
 one who knows that
Tyrael happiness
 whether good or bad in this life or in the next on this planet or in the Heavenly plan is one who knows that it is temporary and useless
 and that an intelligent person should not try to enjoy even think of such things
 is the knower of the self now this medicine is such a selfless person
 knows quite well
 the material happiness
 is the very cause of conditioned material existence and forgetfulness of One's Own Constitution position material happiness is what confuses us material happiness just berries when we think of religion we always think I'm going to pray for happiness I want a piece I want a birthday and for your own and I'm praying for our own ignorance I will say Mary makes my life so easily in joyful
I forget what your world is temporary and how to paint it and painful Mary causing a little more pain you got those knitting needles right there on 91920 that verse but think about that in terms of the relationships they went people annoy us when people disturb us when people speak in ways that we don't appreciate we we think all I hate them they're ruining you know what do they eat what we call it there like blowing up my space or they're too harsh in my what do we call that a hard question my what's a phrase
 there's something phrase like the ride dude you're harsh in my like I forgot what it is
 but like you know everything was cool until you came along just started speaking the way you start speaking and now I'm upset that's harshing my mellow thank you John and I mailed off of my cloud dude and you
but I'm so in any case if we didn't have those people that stirred up such emotions in us we would likely just settle into a very kind of media you know meet mediocrity and so on
 let's not get frustrated when people disturb us let's use it as the let's use it as a stimulus for deeper introspection and deeper purification by the way a shoot of the one who asked the questions right on the message board what do you say
 what is there is there a narcissistic trying to manipulate gas light control you or turn against you how do you empathize with them when their nature is in intrathecal to empathy well that's when you got to be that's when he got to be big we already think we're bigger than ever
we got to actually be bigger than everybody we got to be bigger than that attitude and see it like a scuba set in in such a zoomed-out phase of people are going through their hate and the end of a person's hating they're in pain to try to take you down there in pain so what am I going to return that hate with hate
 no I just create more more and you know ever do this every day dream of Revenge ever do that yeah yeah yeah I've been there and then I like real bad Revenge
 I'll text you cuz I'm Daydream some pretty horrible things lol I'm going to share some like medieval dark stuff medieval you said hard and Feathering never done tarred feathers in my mind
but I have Daydream some better but I will say how do you feel after you Daydream like you never feel good like like cultivating ideas of ribs and let's face it people don't have this understanding they live in that and they go back to it it's real it's a reoccurring Loop of herb and how I'm going to get them I'm going to I'm going to see if he ever does that again this is what I would do or I do you like this and it recurred it's a rerun in the mind again and again and they live in spite and revenge and that is all consuming and then off then we create a culture that acts on it cray that acts on it like get that chance or someone else crosses them they that they lose they get into road rage or some other type of personal Rage with her no longer controlling their senses in mind we're not we are meant to control our senses in mind this is this is the ABCs of
education I don't know where we missed the memo on this how we're supposed to indulge the census in the mind needs no silly silly goose you don't think a lot of people I think particularly people that are older and retired if you don't really have a purpose or meaning in life it's very easy to get caught up in the in the news networks you have the television stuff all day and you spend your entire day every day just waiting to hear some news about how your enemy is going to go down and humiliation to be crushed it is waiting for that moment you need it you need it you need you're hoping for it and then it goes the other way and you really get anxiety and then it starts to go your way and you're like
 I met so many nice people who've ruined themselves watching
these like the view and stuff like that or these other political shows you who they hate and these people can you get can you get absorbed and who they hate and becomes part of your mind a little thing of the ocean are hating and then if you even try to talk to your friend about whatever they just like they're spitting out some hate it's like they've contaminated themselves learn this whole thing about mind you're not going to believe this way the mention of the showings at first learned about turbo scenarios about meditating on hate and revenge you know where I learned that I don't know did you ever watch Davey and Goliath
 yes you did Mariota I talk to people like when they had you know when they had Gumby when I was growing up it was a Christian one
and so there was this guy baby boy like a ten-year-old boy what a talking dog in the talking dog always gave him some type of like God, it was Davey and Goliath and so a one-time advice for the kid right here the dog always had Sage advice but anyway one time someone really like cheated Davey or hurt baby so Davey would have all these it sit there and he dream of Turbo scenarios or revenge or he's taking this guy that hurt him and pushing him off a cliff and then like you do kicking them down the stairs or hitting him from behind with a branch something like that where he'd be publicly humiliated and then finally Collide Southern then how are you feet tomorrow
 anyway
and in the day and then go live to said
 I don't know Davey I don't think we're bench is a good how do you feel and then his father would give sagacious advice as well as father would say how do you feel Davie when you have these thoughts every band meeting and Kendall and I don't know Dad
 alright we're going to question number to shoot I hope that satisfied your senses in mind steal this from a b a k a r g herbo Miss profess Raghu office Dias de dios
 a list of nice are you can you hear me are you just ignoring my teachers
Rufus
 Spanish like the easiest language to learn
 okay I listen to the latest kuna to 38 a couple more times
 wow she never misses a show and she really listens to a show that's pretty impressive chaput
 I listen to the latest kunai to 238 that was years ago
 no no that's that was an episode 23 does Q&A volume to 30 days you done right 209 days where you brilliantly discussed faith and reason and I have a question that a boxy partition of my tasks we can build Faith through reasoning and things we perceive through the senses for example we can have faith in a guru because we
the behavior or we going to pay it in the scriptures because we apply them and see the results in our life but happily build faith in Krishna and his benevolence right is doing good is Ultimate good if we don't frequently experienced it in this life gracias Los Quiero Mucho ask a question I'm take a take a shot of that first
 I think it's very common
 the people's minds nothing everybody's been a lot of people's mind goes to their lack goes to their Misfortune goes to Heather not doing grade not getting what they want and in in the slightly refocusing or changing pivoting changing the vantage point you can start to say you can you can
but over and see the good fortune and everything in the same way you made a sort of answer the questions already you said in the scripture because we apply them in our life we see the results well part where the scripture says have to see Christian his hand in everything and for us to focus and what we're not unless you're going to a person
 who's going through a life of complete pain from birth to death maybe she's talking with those people are born into pain born into some type of
 risen in a horrible captivity or something like that a lot of people boarded up and around you say I don't know if I can see a benevolent God behind I got here it's sort of sort of
question before where how can you see good in this person that's narcissistic actively hates you enough speaks ill of you writes horrible things about you
 you just got to see deeper you got to see deeper than what's happening and he got to see if you got to you got to train your vision to see krishna's hand and everything of that I think and I think the way you said it at the beginning of class like at the beginning of today's episode was you know what's in those times of payment real growth happens and we were joking hell that Mara makes my life too easy I can't grow anymore I can't be that spiritual you're not helping me so in those times of pain if we're leaning into knowledge if we're leading at the shop strap we're leaning into Krishna for the meaning of the spirit then even through those troubled times will develop teeth growth
 and if we're not willing into resentment
Boolean into bitterness will lean into hate and how does that make you feel is that work is that where is that is that is that a better solution and so a lot of our growth comes from Pain and whenever I see people going through lots of pain that I start to think Krishna has tag them for accelerated bhakti
 and I know Gabby Chattahoochee she's actually very evolved person and it's probably because she's been leading until out of this pain while she's got a lot of family in Venezuela dealing with a lot of hell and and she's trust applying Krishna Consciousness to it what is our only option
 lean into bitterness lean into it's not fair Lena to resentment
 you can try that is never works and never gives you actually what your heart wants cuz to be one
baton and run with this
 I want to think that way
 but it almost feels like I'm like maybe we feel like I'm almost lying to myself I'm kidding myself
 say that there's a benevolent God behind this it doesn't the delay I'm having trouble putting the logic she's she give an example like I might have faced in a guru because I see their behavior and it's so tangible right it's right there in front of me that like I'm okay this person is on to something but the idea that you know
 death is that all of this mess in the world is for our good it's just really hard to put together that's yeah that's it that's it that's when we go to the people that is a great deep spiritual ass in any tradition
that is so many different Traditions around the world have spiritual people that really went very deep and became very involved and what we see in their lives is that they always had this face
 that God is behind everything
 and what that Dennis is that faith
 that enables them to act as Saints in this world
 rather than react out of fear right even like you and I had a little thing that the day rather not B2 not a fight where
 you were in and I don't want to say this like I'm your instructor somebody just cuz I was one step removed from it
 it's a little easier for me to see that we were you would like right in the middle of it looks like something in your life
 was some
 there was a reversal in your life something
that was a somewhat problematic in and I said
 yeah yeah you know it does seem like a problem but isn't it always a Christmas this is how Christopher puts us on the right track right like we have to let go of something that's been stable something in our life that seemed stable suddenly seems unstable as like oh no
 and then we put them we find out that a couple years down the road is like oh it was good that it became unstable because now we're doing this you know and that's how the Saints live cuz they're not afraid of a little pain they're not afraid of a little dose of bitter bitter in their life cuz they know that it can be healthy in that it leads us forward and that's how we make progress we need to let go of certain things to move on to the next the Saints really have deep face and that they've experienced it and so it is something that you learn through experience but you know what is a really important verse in this is a versa
but it is from the sweetest rotaru punished or improper quoted like I don't know how many times he posted his books again and again you know but yesterday VapoRub talk to your you know yesterday Vapor up like to hear that you do for one who has bhakti for one has devoted brother who's got that higher divorce that puddle buck teeth when you get really devoted right today me to God and then it says Utah database to talk her out and has equal face similar face in in the guru right in the the valid true right one who has Devotion to the to God it's Guru
 Tasha Takata Takata the the meaning the message of the of these ancient texts precaution to become manifest prakash at a Mahatma not to do to that such a great soul
 so that
kind of realization again it's not a cheap thing
 and it becomes revealed this is how Body Works that kind of deface that were talking about it doesn't just happen by hearing it once it doesn't even happen just by the clear logic that one may be able to
 frame it within
 there is a strong logic to it that you know the frame with him but it's still hard to accept but really you know is God teaching through illuminated human teacher
 by which we
 by which this knowledge manifest becomes illumined becomes enlightened with B unit lights up with in a precaution to prakash you know me so I get it manifests in a brilliant way so
 it may be that in the beginning that faith is like okay I'll take a leap of faith I'll take a leap of faith to believe that God's hand is in what's going on in my life right now
but the deeper our devotion to God in the deeper Devotion to to the valid Go-Go's
 the more that the conviction that one not only is like saying okay I'll try to I'll try to keep faith in that but the more than one knows it you know I know it I know that this is how God works I feel in my conviction is completely strong and again that's that's the consciousness of the saint so don't expect it to be there immediately but if if you can see the logic in it and if you can see people that exemplified well then you might have that seed of faith and that seed of faith will grow and develop as you practice Devotion to God and Devotion to Guru then it'll
 it'll maturing you and Nunn you feel it deeply all the time
 like that
I guess we didn't get the share Yonex but this isn't going ahead of that right atrium and whether I know the first paragraph cuz we got it
 this is from Adrian will just the way they pronounce in Adrian
 is hilarious that you two just cannot figure out how to pronounce my name it's pronounced in the typical way Adrian will is it typical in odd because they will know cuz I don't mean I don't think he says AJ I think he's like Audrey on her so well the way he wrote it a jury on there's no like a check today
 the typical age of Adrian I mean that's the way I would say it that's what I weigh
shut down for saying it that way you shot us down Mara I think he shot us down sorry let's just say Adrian so nice to me
 it's okay I've come across and instruction for Joppa from the Hari bhakti the loss of Swami about the rules but now you can probably find it now by our recent guest Abrigo pod has grew as he probably like you know the English translation and study of it and I believe
really if you Google mom's brew honey bucket Eva Los 500 copy of it for yourself mom's Brew
 I like that name idea bro bro is it appropriate in translator but he quoted from it isn't it cool that there were so many interesting books to translate they're still out there that we've been translated yet so interesting what the rules are still buried what's a 6 Plus want me to bring David gifted us cuz the works all the vehicles are so vast that it becomes hard to make sense out and then they're speaking of so many different they just went through them and they just kind of lined everything up in a way that it just all fits all the pieces of the puzzle just click click click and I talked about billionaire genius
with an audible character that just gave up everything to dedicate themselves to these books is wrap themselves up in since we really got to study these people with your really study them you'll fall in love with the country when you realized cuz when people give up for something greater its impressive but you realize like how much they had a power they were in the material world it makes what we give up for Krishna puny paltry paltry
 insignificant
 yes thank you and I'll handle Swami so this is a quote from this book o best of the brahmas in all conditions and always one should chant Joppa in one's mind because it has no Faults may not know my mind whatever condition he made mine has no Faults that the name has
never condition he may be whether purified or unpurified condition walking condition or still the standing or sitting condition sleeping condition one should take shelter at the feet of chanting japa a loan and chant Joppa within one's mind my ride listen to a class on this and they're like getting to the bottom of this too I think they quoted this first part should I give a class on it then you should have the answer
 yeah and I wish you have a message for the lunch or the question that last question is this to be taken as a higher instruction for more advanced devotees and after I listen to a class I was just like
 it sure turned out to be exactly what I thought it was what you is
 keep the main thing the main thing like whatever it takes to help you. I'm a holy name
 do that
if I just sit quietly and chant the obvious I can't do it I have to hear it in an audible way or my mind can't focus if I just do it in my mind does that mean I should try harder just sitting there perhaps but
 yeah it doesn't work for me. You know what when I read this year I don't think he's saying don't chanted aloud but I think he's saying you should have a soundtrack going on in your mind all the time
 that happens from Channing the holy name and and the instruction I believe it's in our adoption Tom any word speaks that you can chant the name
 out loud or you can change it is within the mind and it was saying that within the mind is for advanced of all he's not meaning that only been somebody's do it but many that if you're not Advanced you're going to have more
call time concentrating on it if you do just your mind and not allowed and I definitely read post and she'll probably where he was telling his disciples Chan it out loud get your mouse moving get your lips moving get your tongue moving make the sound hear the sound and I think it's exactly what you're saying I agree when I'm chilling out loud I'm generally hearing it better but but I think the artist this person heart box of Alice is saying
 even when you're when you're not you know even when you're brushing your teeth and even when you're you know you can always have the soundtrack playing within yourself
 the soundtrack of costume is mind dear friends
 or doing that we're at Pumpkin Hollow is as part of this Retreat that we did a Pumpkin Hollow and but they did this
 breathwork on a thing
which it which you know it wasn't like traditional pranayama it was like it was it you know I don't know the exact origins of where this kind of stuff comes from but traffic traffic traffic breathwork so so it's not my thing but they're like, I can see why you should come you know and I said okay I'll come did you start crying or something only seen you cry once you know what that was
 100 eyed when I enter died
 if you want to see me cry a lot when you doing this and that and then you got to act like scream
you're like lying on your back and doing all this stuff and then you're supposed to lie quietly
 and do something I forgot what it was
 but I remember when I was lying quietly
 any SI for 10 minutes you're lying quietly after several minutes I don't know how long I was into it I realized
 that the holy name was playing in my mother maha-mantra was going in like on some deep level was going on in there you know
 it was like like it kind of Trapped into some River the holy name that's like playing out like somewhere deep in my the vibrations in my body and I know you are Krishna so is so even if we chat and you know we try to be attentive and I've been chanting 16 rounds for 30 something years
 you know 108 mantras 60
times per day for for 37 years and still I have trouble you know it still did the symptoms that are meant for someone that has Prima doesn't don't manifest in me I did my voice doesn't choke up on a chance I don't cry when I chant you know I don't get goosebumps when I chat
 so busy we know when is that kick in you know it's like what am I wasting my time here you know but but it was still there's something very satisfying to realize that even if I'm not there
 that just by chatting so much
 that is like somewhere within my body this stuff is like flowing you know like somebody down in my body my mind somehow in my psychophysical machine that I'm moving around in here that vibration is like going hey if you don't change Choppa you're going to put something else in your mind and you're going to have other songs Through running through your head it could be TV Jingles running through your head would try to replace all those chanting japa does especially a chanted 32 round roast
people around after you put down your beads you can't stop chatting it in your mind do I ride a motorcycle and whatever rent a motorcycle I just can't help it I'm always singing I'm always singing out loud on a motorcycle chanting singing chanting if I if you ever hear me die in a motorcycle you should be convinced that rocking up went right back to the spiritual World cuz I am bringing the entire and sometimes very loudly don't feel bad be happy for me
 but yeah we need we need to replace any of those old singing There's old songs that don't bring us closer to God with sound that lifts us up sound that makes us climb to higher places sound at which pacifies the mine and sound that gives us deep deep connection with the Lord
