get in here Mary Thursday at the same time 6 a.m. eastern time Thursday what about the William Richmond I think Monday so
 where are you
 where your merch Monday

 wisdom of the sages. Com check it out you know Mara told me as soon as I woke up hey it's where your merch Monday I was like okay and I was wearing the merch without thinking and I was like to do yoga in this thing and it's going to go stinky I'm just going to save it for later and I forgot to wear it
 this is not my merch and you are going to start today cuz she
go to start asking Mars the questions it's so nice having them you are here because we get to hear years and years of spiritual discipline and absorbing sort of knowledge applying it to his life and creating wisdom from that and that we could still learn from all of his his serious spiritual practice and hopefully we can invite into our life as well and we can apply to our life rather so sometimes it specially would have been okay all right that was Siri it sometimes especially when I have particularly wise guess we like to do a type of interview that we called Prophet style which is based off of it's just I like the way that the prophet is question in the book The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran where you just is very broad questions about The Human Experience are presented to tell her
for those that have read the book it's about a very wise man is about to leave where he's been living for some time to return to his home after many years and in all the local people are coming out and I know it's your last chance to speak to him so they want to ask him very important questions I just asked questions I'm very broad topics and I say please speak on this then he speaks so we just want to ask you a questions on these broad topics and perhaps we can begin with all this question please tell us about friendship
 when I think of a true friend the sentence of Rumi comes to mind friends live in each other's heart there's some understanding between that I need to even be verbally communicated because they are in the deepest center of the human experience that feeling heart
end up friends remain friends and benefit from their friendships even if they are thousands of kilometers apart from each other because remember they are together and I buy this mystical bond that is affection late and friendship so this is a true friends of friends who live in each other's heart that for there is nothing more rewarding than a true friendship
 thank you beautiful Mirage can you show the importance of forgiveness seems like it appears in all spiritual cultures
 friend forgiveness means to let go of poison see when you hold the
but someone in reality or in your own imagination is it to you or inflicted upon you if you hold in your memory it will turn into a garage and that the garage is like a stone that is in your in your body it's at companies you everywhere and sports all your experiences those who have traveled backward in India and I don't know what this means is Thorn In the Flesh it's there everywhere so forgiveness means to let go of that garage and then this way it means to let go to expel the song or let go of the poison
 I heard a good one this morning but I have a few moments
getting in the bathroom just to play lectures and someone I heard this morning was
 we have no right to be resentful
 or anything and that was like the title of it and it said that no one dies from a snake bite they all died from the Venom so so many times were bit and we're hurt but it's really well as it pulses through our veins that's where they actually kills us so that it must be like removing that for tomorrow
 miss Nolan dice of the bite everyone dice of the Venom only which is what you keep in inside from it your forgiveness is in your best of interested and want that it can smooth out a relationship so that you can perhaps discover a new dimension in it
The boche Recovery Group which we are meant in yesterday's one of the principles of the 12 steps is you have to go make amends with people that you're harboring resentment with and it's what they call Dave Fearless moral inventory I love this or phrase a moral inventory of fearless were limited of what you've done wrong who you've hurt and then you got to go back and you have to think like okay I'm at this person this person hurt mean you got to unearth all these resentments wear them and then you have to own your responsibilities in where things went wrong and it's so freeing because we could hate somebody
 40 years
 or we can hate people that are dead in the like like like for punishing them
 yeah they got to think you punish someone by not for
having them and just being all of us yet I I don't give in the meter a centimeter or even my doing this you you might think about now the eye that is going to really get it back from me I'm not forgiving them about that is as foolish as it's drinking a cup of coffee and thinking it's it's really the other person
 has to be of any forgiveness realizations I just need forgiveness I forgot I forgive you we we done some shows on that but always one
 one thing that this one great talk on forgiveness that was you just here and he lists forgiveness is this forgiveness is that she goes on and on about her going to so many so many angles so many
interesting fact about King why is it approached it but there's one that always really sticks he says and I believe it was forgiveness is a quiet mind
 it's a it's a it's a it's many episodes if you have something more to say it's nice to tease it out I can only talk from my own experience I think to practice forgiveness and you start to become a vet that would be good now you just get through it so you walk up the mountain baby I should try a little harder by by going on this platform and understanding we are all spiritual swords brothers and sisters at this birthplace
Old Yeller computer program happens to be different the human platform so you may do all kinds of intellectual gymnastics to see about that's like climbing the mountain climbing the mountain but then you finally reach the top you would feel
 oh yeah now I'm ready to forgive you and the rest is a fun-filled downwards climb no no no effort any longer in life it is just relieved relieved but it's it's it's coasting that's right you got you come down this mountain so it does take a little effort to come to that for instance the effort of patience you have to be
because it doesn't help if you say to someone give you but then the next moment you take the knife and no no it's not a mental thing it has to reach so deep in you that is in the painting traces of resentment to this idea of forgiveness can be dissolved and so yeah I have seen in my practical life forgiveness is only possible if you change the level if you are on the you know just so much on the identify the body and the feelings and your ego and so on it is very difficult to do that from the heart
 you can make a mental
get gymnastic stuff to do the Bethesda radical forgiveness in the sense of pockets over with that can come most easily than you when you take your ship and vape from the Harbour of the eagle of understanding that you see all the part of the Supreme One and Two from that left about it's no longer that as a theoretical forgiveness or half-hearted forgiveness of forgiveness by still keeping the knife in the pocket ready to stab know it is a complete and total forgiveness when you could come from that that is my my experience at least for me nothing else has worked for that total forgiveness what do you think of this
Mariah said that harboring resentment is like the beginning of atheism
 meaning I'm thinking he's hurt me she is hurt me he's betrayed me she abandoned me when I'm not understanding that don't you understand like everything's happened to the Lord is giving a particular recipe for your healing for your growth to release you from The Maze of material existence and you're not seeing God's hand in all this we can only see the God's hand when I win an Academy Award I thank God for this and thank God for all the good things but I have to learn how to see God's hand in all the the pain and all the hurt and not even hold the person accountable the city of God God is putting these situations in my life for my edification and evolution you think that would atheism its if this could be us
back to India on life and you when you can't forget sometimes there are moments when you think this was placed in my life from above good reason but still you, so you have an advantage of God as being the Supreme controller but most of the time you don't have so then it's the road to atheism let us be very clear that I want to say you talking now about a lot of in a message to do forgiveness require strength and that is not easily attained that strange that is maybe strength at age like a close to us as steaks I know he can do 100
I give out when I am at 13th and to have someone who can Excel physical exercise he has done and many many many exercises and strengthen this message so I do strongly believe that there is something like a four-week forgiveness myself and a strong forgiveness myself and you need to practice it you need to practice it the smaller things like a weightlifter he would start with 2 kg kg you know better than me but then he will be able after some time as the muscles grow to even do a
 I don't know
now we don't know
 Katie is a measuring unit
 yeah you could really go on and on with forgiveness it's such a deep but let's move to the next connect with it nicely because maybe forgiveness becomes easier as we age but the question is could you speak to us about aging all the changes one how that plays a role in one's life and one spiritual life I thought it would never happen to me it is said at the end of our physical existence
then the god of death knell Mirage has put his eye on you he will first show you give you gray hair that is already happening in our waiting eyesight have your second set of eyes and the the last is moving to eat all of a sudden you have your tooth of your bread and then it's very close to your physical departure on another note aging
 there is a secret about
Beijing which I became aware of in my ear started to come very quickly and then they say 65 you would see the age of stoves come fatty fast do you think every 5 minutes is breakfast subject runs faster than you are aging so anyway spend I saw this phenomena time running Gallop countdown countdown IV game became serious in the end. Is there anything I could do most people I inquired the said no and then I met
a scientist you said there are actually three ages one is your calendar age you find that in your passport in case you've forgotten, I've started interesting is your biological age how good is your stomach how good is your lungs what is with your bladder function and everything and biological age and the third and most interesting age is called you choose
 if this is how you feel yourself how are you identify yourself when you are spilling influence of aging on your body you should still love
to laugh without a reason you should still dance you should still make jokes and laugh and you should still think and have a serious discussion you should still do yoga you should jump over a fence if necessary which young people do my chosen age is 40 years nice and Ashley much but I do feel younger and I and if I'm not then I take an extra rest and then it's okay
 can you share something about
prayer is going to subject we've been talking about for a while
 yep yeah love you. Has jumped over the divine inspiration and most of all when you pray make sure that the real you race it should be in prayer all I heard is a prayer is good Hallelujah and now I do it no it should be the real you who's who is concerned with his something to pray so on
 May 2nd
thing is as far as the Google dia tradition the traditional which I practice and switched back to use highlighted gifts as four steps of prayers that will for sure be answered they all have to do of bringing the person who prays to the stage where the real self-praise first step
 Grace you greater an address to the Lord and then you you praise and you you have something wonderful to say you are the odds of everyone and you know everything that happens inside of me and outside of me something like this praise number one praise
number to yes Hoops look at that you don't know how it hahaha
 balloons rising in the sky creative is up there you need now to connect with you as you are now your situation in the sense that you would cause a cyst on your body can you come to your authentic self that is troubled by a being in the material you taken a humble position it doesn't mean you need to become contrite
do you know it means to just arrived at your situation as you are now so who are the Supreme that is expressing your situation second step step it is expressing gratitude you don't come immediately to give me this give me that give me this give me that you acknowledge to first of all the gifts that are already given to you very important when you are
 address the Supreme thank you for having given me the human form of life American Express from my heart
gratitude I see the sun rising each new day giving energy to all the living entities I see how do you have made the perfect Guest House yellow with food with the air with everything up for us to move on the last two expressing gratitude and the last is asking for a blessing
 Richmond. Check your body Taco He has expressed that when we pray to that Supreme Louis so bendable Walnut who is so absolutely current and has not become angry although we have so often refused to turn to him
thanks for blessing and this of course depends on your situation and also on your Spiritual Development where you are always make sure that the real self speaks it is Norfolk pretends that it is becoming a real in the form of conversation having a talk with the Supreme and goes to these four steps appraising then expressing your own situation then finally giving things for what you have been given and then you may ask for your blessings male always swim member you even when the world becomes dark around me
and it becomes very bright around me when I'm on the stage and very much appreciated male all of his be there not forget this prayer let the real self pray and then go so you can go through all the stages or or do what you want that is sanskrit shloka it says just like a but the Lord is unlimited he is beyond our words and our thoughts yet he finds pleasure when someone prays to him just like the father enjoys the broken language of his Growing Child
 and I ask more about that Marsh
some some time lately in my life I've been feeling this idea that normally where are are wearing this is very much absorbed in the people around us
 let me let me take one step before that I think too many people even that the idea of prayer seems like a silly thing where you're just speaking to an imaginary friend that doesn't exist or something like that do you want my seat though
 but as a person with face
 what I've been feeling is that it's
 our witness is generally absorbed in the people around us is very hard to draw or where in a send
 and it seems like the life of prayers that I met earlier with this got it within the heart and you're feeling that presents all the time but that's the becomes the primary level of awareness and
the rest is actually second or not that you're neglectful or anything but like this becomes the primary thing that God is always right here in the heart and it's something that's constant and I'm forgetting the name of the book but I believe that you would be familiar with it was this book
 about I believe it was a Russian Pilgrim who was trying to understand this mess the way of the pilgrim that he had heard that about this idea praying constantly praying 24 hours a day and he was trying to understand that in the meaning of it could you check your baby to something like that idea with us yeah yeah yeah now that attention is kept by not only the people around us but the situations but if that has become your life then where's your own life
I want to give an example sometimes people are so invested in what they do
 that music that area that they have no existence beyond what they do they have to turn into a human doings and have given up the most precious Foundation of human this that this being the problem with this is when something happens in the outside they they have nowhere to go but the people they invest time and betray them for instance of them off or just don't show up any longer in the relationship then they they have cultivated nothing else than that that's the light and that they loose when something is lost outside but they should not lose is this
is there their own treasure that lies inside so you have to train and my understanding becoming a human being and stopping at stop being a human advisor a human counselor is you and be all of that and be only that I'm sorry biondi that it takes time to come in contact with myself and that is an ayurvedic treatment for this recognizes that this can be one of the cars says of illness to be too much invested in August some traditions speak of losing yourself and others losing falling over and you no longer under the seat of the self and the longer you have been swallowed up by
as I said that bet that creates interdependent interdependent relationships yes the ayurvedic treatment the ayurvedic treatment in overtime to go once a month or every two weeks to go into a house with in-house what about to set bail at the edge of the village they would build up a mad house with Windows facing south
 and not
 then within that house they build another house
with Windows Facing East and West
 so all the lies they would get was in direct light all the sounds they would hear the indirect house has happened it's a normal it happens when you still in the womb of his mother it is happening when he doesn't have these complex relationships it is happening when he has not build and invested alcoholics eternal life which he needs to feed Little with his own life force to keep it alive and in bed he loses himself in so to bring a person to the house within the house he is not but secluded from the world even physically
engage in David also do something there to engage in Reading spiritual readings chanting mantras and we also spiritual activities in relationship to the one with the many names of the the absolute and total investment in an in the outside world and outside relationships so you would take yourself out of society you would stay in that house with in the house for you to choose sometimes for days sometimes small days sometimes only a day sometimes only an afternoon at the night or evening and so on as required so that you can take yourself out of the network
complex relationships free positive and realized
 would you recognize me if you can build one of these houses within the house you can take away from the Superstore then it's even better
 running if you want to take that was a good one
 what is your realizations of pain getting pain in this world
 pain
lead types of pains in three types of solutions this pain of the body when you cut yourself or you hurt yourself or you broke a leg or whatever pain of the body then a little more intense than that is pain of the might that is thank you for keeping couch you are the systematic the pain of the mind that you are hurt and something happens on the emotions and then is the pain of the soul I will explain
 when this pain of the body you cry musical tsmu Nevada when there is pain of the Mind
You Cry tears of the Mind men to tears when there is when you become a you have to say like this that that is a pain in the soul who long spot that relationship of it with the Lord and who also longs to be situated in its real life not at Lisa s of the novel ideas of the body and the mind days the very bad to drink them these two years I just so miserable to make you miserable TS of the soul and I should say the avakin dinosaur
so sweet it is therefore said there's only one price to get caught that that that you cry this spur tortillas so pain of the body ya better you do something before it comes by a regular diet by moving nicely to having some exercise by having enough sleep all of you sleep deprived very busy people then you cannot come to the level of good deep sleep you cannot access the para pathetic nervous system which regulates your digestion and which regulates your
 Never Enough system is regulates your blood Circle circulation and out of it that you are always in that stress
system of the sympathetic nervous system you will become invariably many of our civilization diseases like what digestion you know your family will complain because of the fog yeah but you said I with you you know what all this comes because not enough sleep music by diet thing properly exercising properly and also having that's it good rest go to lest
 mental well-being you can get by this all comes in the crate comes by good friendship
have a talk. It comes by being focused on an inspiring goal in life that gives you confidence and mental well-being and then went to bed becomes also when you stop at that negative self-talk imma go to beat up on all this will not work so this is what I think it is better to do some precautionary measures against physical and mental pain then talk about you know the doctors and and and and so on which your invite once there is the Spain but the sole pain that that people don't even feel it
 any longer it's so old it's so ancient this pain it is so often covered
over by a less than spittle lifestyle that that they don't feel it that they feel the effects of being disconnected that is attached are ruled by what happens you know feeling that the real life runs out of the beauty between the fingers and this is Never Enough symptom you know which is there when you have no deep contentment in in you yeah that's been paid you can you can come on the retreat of the wisdom of the sages have good Association sing your heart out or do like yes the day that everyone was dancing was motivating as if you have love of God you must jump

 we got time for one more
 between pilgrimage what do you like pilgrimage or death
 I think most of most of that I say color has this this death from this question
 that is something we
Gandhi once said that has become my own motor how to deal with it he said
 life and death
 I like to
 ornate wooden boxes
 live
 death
 which
 both of them who's the key
 to open the other
 now listen carefully but this means this is something for the intelligence when you look at life realistically
 Yuva know
 it will come to death one day
 and you will use
and properly this is an Spirit of culture seen as a motivator advice man should keep that in front of his eyes you should not suppress the idea because that will teach him but his essential everything is put on a and b by death except those extension spare two things which have the taste of Eternity to them love to God John thing in the devotional absorption but also let us not being good here in this world being support and so on so remind us on what is it
is it opens up the books of life of a fulfilling life so the both of them are interconnected they belong together and then you do this think sometimes about your death that at the tub
 you will speak and correct but needs to be tweaked and corrected in your life to find the essential fulfilling life and to use every time the time you have enough for filling me it is good to think about it it's not frightening and then
 are you good people out there then when you are thinking about you on that when it comes you won't be frightened, so much but you will be carried by the
good life with you have led by the goodness in the life but you have had that goodness will carry you on Words sometime at the best possible distance to destination but in all cases ever carry you in the Progressive evade death holds the key of life and life holds the key of of death if you live properly if you lived with the goodness then the deadbolt and execute it will be a like moving I just recently and I had with this about the great spirit of Master
 and he told her the 7th
his friend tomorrow I will die but don't tell our exalted Master he's so busy with important things he should not be diverted
 so the next day came I shoke took a good shower dressed in festive garments and gave up his body
 His Last of Us of us informed.
 The first thing was he cried a shock I shook the show is the best then he went to Ashoka I showed you lying in the wrong direction come back now and lie in the proper direction otherwise you give us so much work it took to make it took you two been in the funeral to correct whatever mistakes with that go by the power of this great and merciful master
Ashoka returned a soul can back light in the right direction set sorry for the inconvenience this is the story under Alliance that death doesn't have to be frightening if you have lift properly if you have use the it another thought about that to open your life to all the wonderful opportunities and so on yes
 there's so much more information in The Vedic Bay on this subject to Die the good death
 just thought I'd say that you know we get there I hear so many nice
 testimonies from wisdom of the sages people
cuz there's so many of them and people in their lives are passing away all the time sure and so such a brought this mother passed away recently. He's reached out and our prayers for her and for him and I just just yesterday or the day before a child whose grandmother she was the matriarch of the family there in Caracas Venezuela passed away I love to her she jumped on a plane flew there and took care of everything took care of the family took care of the grandmother helped him do that help the entire family cuz what they're they're hearing from Bob with him everyday there it's giving them the division that they need to be able to deal with life's most pressing challenges and you see the families appreciate it they were all kind of like thank you so much for coming you to stay here and so so it is it's touching to encourage young to hear how my wallet this whole Community has one another like that
