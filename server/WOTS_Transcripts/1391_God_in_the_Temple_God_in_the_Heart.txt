call yamo Bhagavad
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages a day Liotta podcast with your whole crocodile and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York his stupid ass welcome to the show Welcome to episode 1391 is a lot of episodes so while she might vomit out a lot of you guys out there have listened to every episode and I find it quite impressive
 good morning everybody
 that Miss Mary here spending the dials
try the week after our sometime next week yeah but it's a lot to this week we're still talking about the Thomas Ice Age movie Something Divine a bunch of us are going to go see it next Wednesday in Arlington Mass if you're in the area 5 at the Regent Theater come check it out something Divine it's sort of like a he started making a documentary about my life and I was traveling on pilgrimage with me beautiful pilgrimage footage for probably a lot of people that you'll know if you go see it and then it turned into a sort of like a film about a bunch of people's Journey also people you may know and how I pilgrimage transforms people to life and and and people on their spiritual quest to having graduations on that website to see it in Arlington Virginia maybe put it up on the board, said ours are like to Massachusetts
is Arlington Massachusetts
 yeah
 anything else you got to say I hear anything else any other messages marry the right cuz I forgot exact date but it's coming up strengthen Community relationships definitely up your Krishna Consciousness game just by having a group of they become your good friends don't think Mary did it for a few too many many of them two of them I think but yeah they're incredible you know you really you really get to know people I just met up with a bunch of Ice Age things like McDowell and and Watson in La last weekend and we're there for a theater friendship
which is often times your friendship too unlike Isis superficial level perhaps or maybe a level it's just sort of like not in line with our values especially as we start to really
 sort of like refine our values so it's a good way to get together with people and put stupid gives out a topic is that how it works you get out of topic yeah usually every week I'll write out a scene for the discussion that will be based on usually something from the came up in the show the previous week so it's just kind of more like just conversation starters just so the people get to know each other better so we mix it up
 what is anyone's developed a romance from Ice Age group of Romance I'm sure more about that as the week goes but damn you fine
on our website you go to to wisma stages.com and I think there's a sage group you know down the column on the left your little Sagewood thing and click that then it shows like all the different groups and the different people that are hosting those groups the fresh information will come out that the day that we release it I guess Saturday and you can see what are the new groups are there who are the new in who are the sage group leaders and you can pick a time and a group that you want to join and again the sooner that you do it the better because those groups are limited to bed like 8 people in a group and there's hundreds of people getting into those groups
 already that's that's so I think one of the best things we've done with this podcast is Kratos age groups and I'm going to take no credit for it cuz stupid did it really you know it's really brunch bihari Ki chori sundari should repay those especially those three are really running it
and all of this age group leaders is about forty of them you know and they all really they put I hardly do anything that I read it for State poop no sense about it
 anyway
 it's just your humility speaking Prabhu now okay from Clarence Clemons what do you know about Clarence Clemons what do you know about Clarence Clemons I know nothing about Clarence you have absolutely no idea who Clarence Clemons is is he like a football player do you have any idea who Clarence Clemons is
 play saxophone for Bruce Springsteen
 who did I just say I'm looking at the shore father taught Bruce Springsteen Judo Clements alright maybe Thomas maybe he said this to Thomas
it's cuz they're Clarence Clemons become mind allows one to connect with the inner self the soul the very source of our being that's where the music lives that's where the music comes from
 very interesting artist trying to figure out like where is this music coming from
 you know where is this art coming from the com- allows one to connect with the inner self the soul the very source of our being that's where the music lives that's where my that's where my music comes from well I can come and I miss my friend if you don't mind I'd not that is why this is my complete speculation with that dating needles spoken
I believe that artists and there's a lot of artists on the show right now looking at a thorsten from Switzerland is an artist I said maybe you can rest and Danny kozikowski is an artist but I believe that art and music
 it's downloaded from higher beings I feel it when you can get your mind in a place like he's saying they're almost like a Stillness the combined allows one to connect you have to I don't think it's necessarily coming from our soul be or else everybody would be musicians and then every in light I don't think
 I don't think you have to become this great musician to be an enlightened being that's not a qualification being an enlightened being but I think it's almost as if other people if not God or like working through you or through your karma or something but you need to get a still mine whenever I had to write
music and everything like me maybe 12 CDs
 I'll have to do it in a place where nothing bothered me and I had to just either sit there or one time I would just one time I literally drove from New York to Miami just to finish a record and I just wrote it in my mind because when you drive you can find a Stillness in your mind you don't talk about that that driving sort of like meditation I don't really do that much people do talk about it yeah cuz there's just drive down 95 South in like a peace comes and then you get loaded with information if I find and it's almost like the songs are put together
 maybe it's just something about the steadiness of that kind of yeah we're just blowing and yes and I and I will say I am going to really want to heart I wholeheartedly believe in the combine allows one to connect with the inner self weather
inner self or some other outer self being using your body color sign on this one unless I believe it was you don't believe let's let's work with our own Josh to hear that that there's a God of every living being right is that price except we could be within this demi-god that's going through my body right and Break Down The Walls or you know mean
 all right it could be God it could be a demigod it could be a being could be a spirit whatever it is there's something external happening if you could just get the mind out of the way when when he sings There's Something internal happening in the end they have to calm the Mind deeper yeah yeah you got to come to mine that's the first stage
 great I'm sorry I can't 100% ghost I'm with it but I do agree the first
asking you to co-sign with this rug and okay I agree that calming the Mind allows one to connect with something what do you want to think what do you think about this well I'm just my thought is that he's just sharing something here that you know it was certainly a lot of people think about a lot of people don't even come to the stage of thinking about this that if I would call my mind
 that I can come in touch with something within why do you want to call that God within or what do you want to go he's saying it's the soul right that that there's there's a me underneath all of this that comely I'm not even in touch with Connelly my mind is just kind of running and its own Loops or being distracted by external things and so that essential kind of power or the connection to something deeper weather steeper artistic inspiration or deeper knowledge or deeper feelings that I just run through life never come into contact with that I'm not going to get
contact with that until I calm my mind and so you know Anakin people talk about that but the the Deep profound experience that it's not a cheap thing it's something that requires effort and in there for like in the yoga tradition
 These Arm
 you know these qualities are practices that involve austerity that involve renunciation that involved I'm going to let go of certain things I'm going to renounce certain things I'm going to the game this Focus for the game this experience you know in order for there to be deep contemplation or deep meditation or or feeling have connection to God within our heart or a deep connection to feeling one's own self as opposed to just experiencing the body in the mind it's not a cheap thing and end so
initially ideas like austerity renunciation you know that we get turned off by then they don't they don't appear as
 pleasurable
 but they're offering something very profound and they're offering something something something in life that we're all meant to experience that we too often do
 yeah I like that I like that it's almost like we created a world of busyness that really breaks us from that I was like thinking about like even like primitive living living where you're just like walking around collecting wild strawberries or basket weaving all these things were just too primitive live in a primitive way or meditative
 yeah we created like a a busyness that gets us right in the mud like we're living in a in the mind and
and therefore you're missing out on on spirit and in deeper connection and we're living with anxiety that comes with that so all these techniques your mentioning weather I see you in a month for meditation music and kirtan asanas it's all to come the mind all of these things are just keep the mind, so we can get to this next phase which is connection
 thank you Clarence Clemons don't have a yoga background and they come to this conclusion and maybe he comes through it through perhaps playing music in on your musician you're playing scales everyday or playing things on a regular basis and some type of like steadiness that can maybe externally see monotonous that's a deck in that comes to mind right yeah yeah
 interesting okay interesting that you
What musician in for this did you know of Clarence Clemons but you are his fans has really into Springsteen I was trying to please you last night before I went to bed
 by watching a bunch of music videos of bands that use you about music that occupied part of your Junior life but you knew all that all the stuff about Classic Rock on the radio and I know so I back then to know about like Led Zeppelin to know about them how to read a magazine you got to get my queen size I did that kind of stuff you looked real nowadays you just Google who the hell was Led Zeppelin search and like it the whole bio you get like whatever happened to John bottom there is some of that you just it's a search away but back then you have to do like research and find books or literature or maggots fat Fan magazines and you knew a lot about the stuff I don't know nothing about it I heard
songs on the radio but you knew stuff so I was like you know what I'm going to do tonight before I go to bed Mara she's just like go to bed and I was like no I'm going to research music that goes to the likes and the first one is Kansas I never liked Kansas but you didn't know cuz matter fact I talked about how much I didn't like a very good man which brought me to The Devil Went Down to Georgia be playing at Meadville music which I didn't like but I would if I would be listen to the music now I'm in the house I have to admit that Pink Floyd or white.
 Quite unique very talented musicians and then I took it to a rush rush live wasn't interested either they were good but 100 I Google them to
bad you didn't like that that's what I meant you know what you're saying is let you know when your kids you just learn stuff easy and that you got that you got that kind of open hard drive just to kind of start filling up so I was into I was in the music when I was you know 10 11 12 13 years old big time you know it's just listed so I remember all that stuff see I see I missed it somehow I don't know how you know I was at Parmatown the titty knows all this stuff in that time like the Clarence Clemons I could go no for know you know is Clarence Clemons is solo2 like certain songs instead of the Jungle and I could go just like you know there's a hole it's just in there you know that's why we got to be learning mantras at that age you know
 Note 4 Note with Clarence Clemons on Jungle and you could be learning like Vishnu sahastra naam
I wish I was I really wish I was
 the next year I are joining in on the charger slow cooker. We should have a kids we should have a kids shloka group adults shloka group both the kids 12 and up the kids are the future right now

 things that are Troublesome to your heart are going away
 yeah I think things are less trouble
maybe I think it's true for me yeah it's true for me yesterday it was going to do what I did to even yesterday if you miss the show yesterday was a little bit of a bad mood and these two were not helping the matter but I will say I could step outside of my mind and observe my mind being a child you know and that was a good thing it's not like you're just like your auntie like a runaway train you're like oh I'm going to runaway train with someone else is driving this thing so no it didn't destroy everything Troublesome to my heart necessarily but it gave me a list of Vantage Point she liked Buicks as not me I'm not who you think I am the mind and you just like falling apart
 that's where like a real roller coaster
I had an ability just view a roller coaster disaster happening we should mention that at such a Time by slow cooker to let you know I'm about to put together the next local group exactly how and where we're going to present that or how this going to work will we're going to try that we got to talk like that and I'm meeting today or going to meet me cuz to me like the masterminds so you know we could finish up this chapter today let's do it but let's let's this could be super quick overview let's finish it if it's ready to be finished let's not rush in this enjoy the journey while I said we could do family life nor has been instructing you to steer you know about these kind of social
 standard not standards but like the way to live you know like what food
we should live according to the sacred texts and you know how how the the married person the house so they should be living you know it began
 you're just like a lot of qualities that you and I talked about the attachment and it talked about Simplicity frugality all these things are there and talked about how the the household and maybe in the association people that aren't so spiritual and in that they don't have to put on a show as a matter fact it might even be helpful for them to kind of a like they're just as materialistic as everyone else externally but internally I got a whole thing going on and it's in then it began to talk a lot about because you're in that circumstance you know it's it's a time of life where you have some wealth how are you going to engage that well how you going to avoid the pitfalls that that wealth can pull you towards and so then you know it was speaking of how that will should be engaged in maintaining other
 and
NN NN what they would call Access yagna or acts of sacrifice meaning you don't you and Gage that and ceremonies that will uplift the people you know that they will uplift everyone's Consciousness uplift your own as well as others and a lot of that had to do with feeding people you know where who you know who Iron people respecting people caring for people provided four people by feeding for them and then there's like a section were described all like the auspicious times to do that and all the auspicious places to do that and now we're getting to the point where like will who is the focus of the ceremonies who is the focus of these meditations know cuz it's ceremonies are just meant to bring the mind to a central Focus
 and then he said that really interesting gross we had a couple days ago where he said that Christian is the root of all it's like if this whole if all of us are like branches on a tree Christian is the root of that tree and so when the
Dion
 the focus the offering you can say the worship and I think we can talk a little bit about this word worship today but the when is all goes towards the root than everyone benefits and he was providing this says like a kind of a formula for just like Universal Harmony and Universal Evolution you know that we can all uplift ourselves and so now he's going to describe more about that but that person that you know Krishna and Krishna in the heart of every living being that all of this whatever ritual whatever austerities whatever frugality whatever main is all all of these household duties are all men to help us understand and realize and feel God in the heart got in our own heart and got in the heart of every living being just like Clarence Clemons is feeling
 nicest text 38
 okay need to steer the Super Soul in everybody gives intelligence
to the individual soul according to his capacity for understanding there for the Super Soul is the chief within the body Chief the Super Soul is manifested to the individual so according to the individuals comparative development of knowledge austerity tenants and so on. It said that
 that Krishna has created many residential places like bodies of human beings animals Birds Saints demigods you name it if it's a living being he's present in there you know as a as a part of Mama and so you know that we were going to hear more about that understanding that feeling that this is the Chiefs all within the body cuz it's the one that
 that's the real maintainer
 maybe you can win in a mansions that the Super Soul is manifested who who's coming in contact with who's feeling it Clarence Clemons said you had to have a Calm Mind
hi and you feel something inside it here says the super-soul is Manifest to the individual soul according to the individuals comparative development of knowledge and Tina Sanchez trivial knowledge but knowledge of who I am. Is what this world is what's what's matter what spirit being able to discern
 so the individuals compared to development in knowledge austerity Penance and so on
 so again you know that that means I'm beginning to understand what this world is and who I am that I'm not this body I'm not this mind the things of this world are temporary true happiness doesn't come I'm starting to let go I can perform as a Penance in my stereo let go of these things and as I'm starting to let go I'm starting to come more in touch with that voice inside
 it's pretty amazing how we just like
programs puppets running on sensual desire is like making making poor choices and getting dragged around becoming proud of it you know that's what I'm I'm doing it is that you're doing it or about controlled senses are doing it
 yeah I bet if we have some good luck or some good fortune that we get our against about it and yeah some knowledge imbibing knowledge is not what we do on our podcast you want to figure out ways so people can study more and we want to make the show available for everybody figure out courses figure out groups are we talked about knowledge we have special things we talked about austerity and perform some special at it sometimes we do that I drink heart equals okay we're now we're going to make a commitment to do this in our community follows that lead and this is the way that we imbibe knowledge and then hopefully some of that sticks to the ribs and it becomes part of our new being where
those impulses again they never they never served me and sometimes it we can people click in right away like this makes so much sense and sometimes it's like a waterfall on a rocket takes maybe a thousand years to smooth that Jagged rocks and eventually become smooth but it might take lifetimes to do it a different things goes quicker than vegetarianism that makes a lot of sense. Just going to go on an Impulse I thought I do like the taste of meat but I'm not going to eat it just sometimes we can act into something really Clicks in and there's some things are just harder habits to break the been almost like we've been running these bad habits for Life X
 for showing up every day and just imbibing this stuff it it's it's um
 thank you and I've been practicing this for so many for decades now and sometimes it's scary to think what if I did know all of this
 you know
but also we all set to think of
 where am I now and what am I not you know those those beings that are so much further progressing I look back to where I'm at right now it's horrible to be here right now. This is so sad buddy help this man you got to keep moving
 deeper understanding cuz a lot of the the sacred texts would be really going on about how we can enjoy this world you know what time is always this response to to the earlier texts like text that get into the karmic under the the the division of the text that talk about material Prosperity through piety and sacrifice
 and here it's saying that if that's if all you get is okay let me be a doodle
Pious person in in through that I'll enjoy the world
 then you haven't gone deep and in so he's what's what Naruto sharing his at all of those kind of instruction are meant to connect you to the Supreme Being the root of it all and when you get there you should be connecting with every living day you should see God in the heart of every living being you should feel it and so they should be natural respect and love that you feel for everyone and that's where spirituality goes and if you don't get that you're missing the point in these and that's how this chapter's it's going to kind of make that more clear as as we on it is it the abrahamic Traditions that just don't get that or is it just me breathing narrow narrow short-sighted myopic fundamentalist abrahamic Traditions that don't get this
seems like everybody's worshiping God or Jesus or Allah or but they're but they're have this like thing where if you don't worship how I worship
 you are cut off from God in the opposite direction you're taking the express train downtown so my question is there are people who worship God why are they getting this realization and appreciating other people on a spiritual practice is it either woven into their teachings or they just worshiping in a wrong way cuz I do worship God some people will kill people in the name of God
 they're missing something I don't think is everyone in The Vedic tradition is getting it and in the other traditions and not getting it I think that you know that there's a progression it's a Natural Evolution it's a natural a natural progression I mean
 it's something that's widely observed
because you know it's it's ubiquitous this progression from Carmel Indiana to bhakti and so you know the progression from seeing this world is my place to enjoy and then the response to that or the reaction to that is snow it's a place to renounce and then the synthesis unibody is both world and bracing and world-renowned sing a Did You Know by focus on the Supreme you know through through the motions but you'll find that you know
 like for instance when we talk about Buddhism when when when Western people talk about Buddhism
 generally we think of it as a very gearonic path if it's a path of recognized in the world is a place of suffering
 letting go of all the attachments in achieving the freedom that's a very ganic idea but I was reading this book on Buddhism where are they I it was right
play some Professor who you know visiting a Paul and was really studying it and half naked when you get into the places where people really live this is more of a karmic path it has a lot to do with finding the priests the Llama that's going to do the rituals that's going to help you counteract bad, that's a very karmic idea right and then in Buddhism I also understand that there's more do you know that is a course is not as pronounced as we find it in the bucket tradition but there's an idea of devotion there's an idea of love being the higher goal and will find that in Christianity on Friday to do you will find that it you know it's all over the place but where we find a most clearly articulated I would believe
 I don't think there's any
 any debate where you find this idea most clearly articulated is insured by the time you know that most clearly saying look it's like
three stages on a on a ladder it's like you do it and it is like that dialectic kind of idea where there's a thesis let's enjoy the material world by being I said that I don't make us happy and then there's the antithesis are you kidding me material happiness is always followed by suffering renounce the things of this world and then there's a synthesis when I see it all is God's energy I can embrace it I can renounce it at you know I can embrace it externally renounce it internally
 but it's all it's all I see it all the connection I see myself and connection I see everyone in connection with that route you know it's there and the abrahamic Traditions but you know but it may not be as clearly articulated always but you know there's always those Mystics that are getting into it right now for sure
 okay my dear King in great sages and saintly persons song mutually disrespect
dealings at the beginning of trait of yoga
 DD Worship in the temple was introduced with all the paraphernalia so it seems like deity you worship was meant to plug a hole and dealing with people who are disrespectful
 if you if you're respectful we we we got into that I think it was a couple days ago maybe where we were discussing the four different ages and how each one has a different yoga Dharma and so in such a yoga it's just meditation since I'm going to sit and meditate deeply going to go within I'm going to enter into state of somebody and I feel God in my heart and once I feel that I understand everything I understand how I relate to you I understand what's going on inside here is going on inside you too and that we're all equal on a spiritual level but if I am no longer able to as as the age changes
the external atmosphere begins to shift and now people aren't so capable of of that and then there's the the age word big sacrifices are being down but as we become less capable of Performing those as well then I say okay then then in order to comment if you can't come into contact with God in your own heart through going into a state of somebody very elusive State of Consciousness then create a temple right which is kind of like an external manifestation of the heart and in the center of it on the altar you place God
 Rite Aid in through ritual you call God to take that form and now you now you could engage in a sudden and now you can gauge in a practice where you're beginning to see God here in this Temple right as a kind of like a springboard to find God the heart if I can't do it through
body then I'll do it to Tampa worship and then feel it in my heart and see it in the heart of every living being and in it but just says you're saying are our common the common like default when we're beginners at this
 is that we're going to we're not going to see the depth of it we're going to take it on the external level and we're going to feel like just what you said God is in my temple but not in yours or no God is it everyone's Temple because God's in everyone's body but so so that the temple worship is meant to help us
 kill God and see God in everyone in there for relate to everyone respect everyone love and one and if we don't connect with it in that way then the whole thing is kind of them
 has no life
 and I think the next person is going to get into that it in more detail you text 39 my dear
kinguin great sages and saintly persons my dick text 40 sometimes a neophyte devotee offers all all the paraphernalia for the worshiping for worshiping the Lord and He factually worships the Lord as the deity but because he is envious of authorized devotees of Lord Vishnu the Lord is never satisfied with his devotional service oh ouch can see okay this is God in the temple but the guy next to me I don't like this person this is where we're working towards
 that we're supposed to see God in every living being not just seeing God in the temple rush you miss the point this is where Bangladesh is going right through it getting like all these B Nia fight Islamic terrorists have taken control take it this isn't like roomy weapons and they're creating our God is good
the heiresses your God isn't the real God so we're going to Natalie just bring your damn your temples were going to burn down your village is going to rape your women is it's like total serious genocide over the same worship over worship
 yeah they missed the point you know it's as we're talkin about this Evolution you know from The Vedas The Vedic texts these ancient texts right they do a lot with the ritual and that the common ritual is the fire ritual right where you
 you you do we see it as like if you take some bricks and you make this fire pit and you light the fire with munchers you're making offerings into that fire and everybody has anyone from that calls your kind of has it impressed in their mind the sacredness of this and the the idea that we take what we have and we make an offering of it to God and that brings auspicious
but as as velocities literature is kind of grow in kind of develop
 that they will take that like the bug of agita will take that
 that the fire ritual and use it as a metaphor saying like your entire life can be this sacrifice right and just as you recognize all the ingredients in the sacrifices being sacred and holy and spiritual spiritual eyes because of the way they're being engaged your entire life can become spiritual eyes when you make your life a sacrifice when you make your life an offering and end in
 that's what it is that's why it's being brought up here now if we go back to the third Cantor this is Versa totally relate to this
 I think you'll like this are not ready
 is bhagat on 3rd Canto 29 chapter text 22
one who worships the DD of godhead in the temples
 but does not know that the Supreme Lord as part of mama is situated in every living entities heart
 must be in ignorance
 and it's compared to do you know what they compared to the compared to one who offers ablations into ashes so like you know if you have that fire pit but there's no fire in it and you're pouring ghee until you're just wasting your Gigi and it hurts like there's no the offerings not being accepted there's no connection don't waste your game era write that down never waste give us your key. This is what property rights in the comments you to that first 32922 he says it is clearly stated here in that the Supreme personality guided in his planner expansion is Super Soul is present in all living entities
 the living entities have
 there are how many different kinds of bodies
the living entities have how many different how many how many species of living entities are there on board to The Vedas
 8.4 million million four hundred thousand million four hundred thousand different kinds of bodies and the Supreme personality guided is living in everybody both as the individual soul and is a Super Soul since the individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and in that sense the Lord is living and everybody and as super-soul the Lord is also present as a witness
 in both cases the presence of God in every living entity is essential to proper use of word essential like that's the
that's right that's
 that's what's meaning for the body is something this coming and going and changing and shifting and but the essence is at the soul in the super solar there
 therefore persons who profess to belong to to belong to some religious sect but who do not feel the presence of the Supreme personality got it in every living entity every living in this is that and everywhere else what about them there in the motive ignorance ignorance if without this preliminary knowledge of the Lord's omnipresence one simply attaches himself to the rituals in a Temple Church or mosque it is as if he were offering butter or get into ashes rather than into the fire one offered sacrifices by pouring clarified butter into a fire and Channing Vedic mantras but even if there are mantras and all conditions are favorable
if the clarified butter is poured on ashes than the sacrifice will be useless in other words a devotee should not ignore any living entity
 the devotee ignore interesting the properties that we would think ignore me psycho I'm not listening to them or some like that but I think he's saying has it you know I think it's time that together with the word ignorance like not recognize the life not recognize the sacredness in any living entity in other words a devotee should not ignore any living entity
 the Duvall you must know that in every living entity however insignificant he maybe even in an ant God is present and therefore every living entity should be kindly treated and should not be subjected to any violence
 and improper this is Papa's kind of you can say almost like Pet Project or pet peeve or you know like this is where all calmly go at this point in modern
fly Society slaughterhouses are regularly maintained you know these factory farms or just kind of like proper swing to them eat any saying this is where this is like the real
 festering sore and societies that were committing systematic heavy-duty cruelty
 and not recognizing it as such so it's a slaughterhouse is a regular maintained and supported by a certain type of religious principle but without knowledge of the presence of God and every living Andy and his so-called advancement of human civilization either spiritual or material is understood to be in the motive in your amazing how they think I like a nice out the same I I had no understanding of one either my cell phone at certain point in my life and so we have homework for this today homework is like next time you see someone today
or see somebody in the News That's driving you a little bit crazy or in my case there is a gigantic I don't even know what it is but it looks like a bug going in the kitchen now for 2 days mosquito it looks like the size of my hand do they look like mosquitoes with a bigger this is like bigger than both of them and I repeat I don't know how to get it without killing it but I'm going to just say you know what you beautiful thing I'm going to try to figure out how to release this without instinctively I want to watch it with a shoe that that's the only one that's how I grew up with you bug whack with shoe and so there's a principal returned to practice this year that there is a saw and there is a Super Soul within that disgusting bug on my wall I have to learn how to CB
 it seems get a soul
what is the type of prejudice it's a type of a Prejudice we have against things that we don't think I'm attractive
 racism towards bugs
