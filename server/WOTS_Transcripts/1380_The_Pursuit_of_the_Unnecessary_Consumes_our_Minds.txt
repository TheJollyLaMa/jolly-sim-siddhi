Come to register there's a few spaces left Glenn Beck program a nice group we got a nice group really looking forward to it and we're really encouraging everybody that come down to the LA Los Angeles Rafi otra and just to celebrate Los Angeles Rob the actual we have the man who's heading up the team and he's been doing it for 48 years has purple he's the temple president of the Los Angeles
mini dwarkadhish Temple service welcome to the show how are you thank you I'm pretty good I really good Los Angeles Temple I have not but I've been here for 38 years old. When we've I rolled in I haven't been here in 20 years in Los Angeles and I rolled in and it came out in front of the temple yesterday and I and I remembered the first time I came here
 which was about 36 or 37 years ago and I think so hospitable was the temple president back then and he's still you know if the president is like no it's like it's a thankless task of service problems dealing with
everybody else's problem everybody has issues Scandal spread like there's no accountability with the material world you have to stay to the North American BB&T trustee which means like for North America is responsible for like the publishing and she'll probably have you got a book of shield prabhas in North America so I'll see who was behind that you know he's been there BB&T address to all this time so tremendous service I think it's the best I travel a lot it's the best Harry Krishna restaurants in it at least North America at least North America I went in there a few weeks ago when I get my book to her and I was like
 it has become better than it used to be
better and better and we're all excited to eat there this week so give us a little history about the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles when I started 38 years ago it was it was a little bit difficult because there was a lot of transition going on at the temple from one management to another so our crew is very minimal but good thing about it was everybody was young lady knew what to do so I just think you backwards like that
 it was pretty difficult very difficult and the devotees that we worked with were really fired up I mean that's that's the difference just being really absorbed and really wanting to make the best of what happened everybody took on more than they could actually really do but they did it anyway and that went a long way so we have some devotees here like reading a bushing people like that they're just like
hard-working depend on right now and just leave my wife give us give us a small group but we are really together and we were able to pull it through so these days we're a little bit better because we have a lot of deliveries coming from around the country that come and help we have up in its consulate on Valley by Sheikh Abu and the team and this is really made the festival expand it's been very very good that's what our listeners to get involved so you know and you moan as she comes down from Jesus working hard like anyting she's great yeah she's so together real organized I think that's what's really important that the devotees we have a real organized and it's like clickety-clack you know you just give him a call
people that help and boom it happens a lot of our listeners a kind of new to bhakti and they may not even attended or at the actress so can you just just in a nutshell give him an idea what they could expect to experience on Sunday they come out weird replicating what's happening in juggin up Tori and you took another test of us humongous as we all know that's that's a Ancient Temple Town in India originally celebrate this Festival take it back to 1.0 yeah okay so we said we were replicating something that happens in India and juggin up for you is been going on for centuries if not thousands of years and so here in America we call this Festival the Festival of the Chariots it's a celebration and it's capped
millions of people for centuries so were replicating died here and according to Vedic scriptures you know just simply seen the the Lord Juggernaut Festival in itself is amazing it's it's a it's the only application and so we have these three huge Cherry has 30 ft High we have ropes that are attached to the Chariot and it says that even just by grabbing the rope and pulling the car The Chariot of a Krishna its countless purification it it's cleansing of the Soul cleansing of the heart and so we have people all the Chariots as we've done for the last you know 38 years yogaville nice and and everybody grab the rope and pulls the cart and while that's going on we have a huge your tongue
happening people chanting Hardy Krishna and glorifying Lord jagannath we have three deities one daily on each card this is something that happened many thousands of years ago there was a great king into doing yet he wants to worship Krishna independent material form so to speak or a physical form and he had this great Carver vishwakarma come and carve the deity but he only agreed the car the DD if he could have 21 days in solitude and from there he would carve it and then they would be able to use and worship the deity of Lord Krishna so in the course of that vishwakarma said that I'll only do it if I'm not interrupted if don't interrupt me and at the end of three weeks you can come so Andrew Junior
a little bit anxious because it was two weeks and you didn't hear anything didn't see anything so it became anxious and out of that he went into the room where they show, was doing the The Carving and the DAT wasn't complete it was almost complete it but it wasn't complete so the form of a juggernaut is that way because he broke the agreement that he had wished for, so it's real, just disappeared so now we have the DD form of Krishna on the cards as they were thousands of years ago when Deedee on each card has a very unique looking for math Christian I have no arms you know it's a very unique and when we say car we're not talking about a child's wagon cart like the wheels are about as
call Alyssa person writing like you as a person and it's pulled by humans quite a spectacular and I will say that before I was in a regular devotee was just getting into bhakti my band was doing a tour around America and we happened to land in Los Angeles on the day of the rocket launcher rangement and I will stay just like you said just to see the carts in to see the Lord had to pull the car it's something ships it it forced us all we know is pure or something happens to the Mind something happens to the Consciousness some purification going on and I will say I was changed after that day and so I really want to thank you and your entire team for doing what you do. It's affecting more people than you know that we want with this podcast in with the numbers of people that listen to this we want to blow this Festival
Edgar and bigger and bigger every year so everybody listening is is doing what your moon and her crew are doing some people be cooking the feed some people doing flower Garland some decorating music there's not a dancing with lots of food it's like it's a real big huge thing it's not just a religious Festival but it's actually a profound spiritual experience it transcends cultural borders yeah it's it's like a universal human activity and no matter who you are what culture you are whoever you come you'll get this profound you know spiritual experiences by the Association of the festival itself even if you have friends that are sort of not into spiritual bring them bring them if the amp and I will say it's something magical
can you can you can let me know if I'm on the right page with us you might think well because what happens is a long Parade starting from Santa Monica and then it ends up in Venice Beach in no big almost like a big circle of a hairy Krishna little feeling a little book tables and people talking and our wisdom the sages table if you're telling me set up in a yoga class and and fresh delicious when she didn't answer his Booth but I can ask your question fever growing of ecstasy and you don't have anyone ever doubt if you're new to this you might have a doubt like hey you know what
 just might be just like a party I'm feeling good cuz I'm at a party and what's going to happen is you're there then you going to get a doubtful then you're going to say what ya been a speech must always be like this no no no no no that's where you're wrong and you can just tell by walking outside
find that transcendental Circle and all the sudden the modes of passion ignorance are going to overwhelm you and your life I got to get back in that Circle this isn't normal Venice Beach I mean the Rath yatra it actually is like that it's a beacon of unity Unity as a serious Rumble down the street everybody just come completely alive and enjoying it and they chat and so it's like a picture of unity and the festival welcomes people from all walks of life regardless he's like fanatic Westboro Baptist Church kind of characters out there like they are against it but they become part of it and it comes to still part of the fun too and all this kind of stuff that you got all going to hell yeah and then went but we found out after the after you know following them and I'm seeing what they're doing they actually put their signage is down and they walk over
three piece and then enjoy the free food that were at the food gets served at usually the route to 10,000 10,000 that's beautiful to help if I was behind a hungry she doesn't freak out you know she's real. You know just a solid person
 but we want to thank you and we have great appreciation for what you do and we we want to actually be better contributors to what you're doing there and bring more and more people to this festival and it's just the way to really have not just a transcendental experience yourself but bring people to experience the joy of being in this world but not of this world
exactly what you feel like when you're there thank you so much for doing what you do for a living I'm so honored thank you for being part of this Festival this year so great a performing that is through outside I can't wait I'm really anxious to see that so thank you very very much and thank you all might be coming we will spend a little time at our table like I know you'll be busy but I will have our table setup and everybody can be like a celebrity guess with all that it's 38 years Temple president got a full head of hair of exactly the same as he did 30 years ago to I don't know how he does it. I got jeans but do you have any words of wisdom for us this if we're going to the Festival this weekend any words of wisdom of how we should would Our intention to be or how are
I should be give me some advice have an open mind and an open heart okay that in itself goes a long way because if you have open heart you'll feel the Ecstasy of the festival and I like it and I think that if one actually feels the festival Bill see how so many people are coming together of all walks of life and they're all chanting and they're happy but in the open a heartbeat at that Inn we can do our hair did that celebration part I love that place to meet in the time does it because his is on this Sunday and we start the parade and Pico and Main Street in Santa Monica at 10 a.m. on the boardwalk on the Main Street Santa Monica right and go down into the boardwalk.

 good to see you have a great day happy bowl
 well that was nice good examples
what is ready. I'm in the red coat on the right before you turn the stream about what time which is every means of Conquest when should I be respectful of Base since he's in the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you this your most human being to start watching the goddess of learning and she'll be off today of the author non-stop reggae Jabari Zuniga me and my rendering service to the pier devotees all of this Troublesome the heart weak and eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who has praised the transcendental songs will be established as an inevitable fact
 that way before you want me to get a I'm going to jump into the bog of a top right now cuz that verse we just quoted us depreciation about the issue is from the back of it comes from the second can do and you might ask Will how is that in the back of a truck
if it's a glorification or invitation because the bottom of time
 right you can chop it down to four versus it's the message of questions and answers about the Supreme personality of God has been presented many times at different places just like right now so here's the next verse in the van for that one look at yours house we are reading this this morning so here's the next verse as soon as a revocable loving service is established in the heart the effects of Nature's mode of passion and ignorance such as lust and desire and hankering disappear from the heart then the devotee is established in goodness and becomes completely
 happy does established in is the next one right that's established in the Montebello mall
goodness the man or woman whose mind has been in livened by contact with bhakti to the Lord games positive scientific knowledge of the personality of godhead in the stage of Liberation from a material Association we're going to get a glimpse of that we're not going to get the whole thing going to get a glimpse like a trailer of a movie if you come to this Festival this weekend cuz I'm not in the heart
 write a note that the not the Harlequin all that nice we all got this. I love is not flowing exactly not long ago I was walking down the street and there's like a guy that would choose a super of a building and he had a hose and he was like sprinting down the that you know that I got a little flowers outside on the sidewalk
I think you know and he was kind of way down there and it wasn't getting good water and I just saw that can can I go under the kinky was like so grateful you know if you listen to this one if there's a kink there's no flow but not in the heart that's the not that Isaac
 the soul to the body
 that's one of the heart is pierced and all misgivings are cut to Pieces what does that mean a misgiving on my messican said you know anxiety because of I'm not getting this for that no no no that's a misgiving you don't it's all. You need to be worried about that all I'm upset because these people are saying this and you don't even need to be worried about that let that brute of actions is terminated that's like you've hit them, know you've hit the Domino in the mail
lifetime's of dominoes like a Guinness book of record of dominoes going down that's your material existence is terminated it's over no more write the chain of fruit of actions is terminated when one sees the cell mean in the spirit right in this means Parma as manager that's right when they said his self is that was going to follow my senses and my mind is the master no no no no gets the self got to be a controller at the soul when one sees the selfishness or is it the soul to talk about are they, when will probably be 10 minutes late so we can go to the commentaries on there so you want to run but let me do all your homework for everybody today first canno chapter to read it just read the verses if you want to dive into a perp everything is laid out there
right here and so I pulled the cash or side so you know what was his read this today so that's why I'm inspired this morning you are fired up I can feel it well it's jet lag got me up early it's Mary's birthday that to trying to figure out how to please her expectations do you answer texts so many it's like
 spell extinguish that fire up the shires okay you want to go to this what you want to do you want to get into the Bible somewhere in or do you want to look into this will because that's the not in the heart is pierced it's powerful stuff right here than out of the hardest Pierce and almost giving to cut the pieces that she is terminated this is Canto 1 chapter 2 test 21
 okay I've got the 5 commentary some of the maybe in Russian
 are we got to give us Mommy,
-1
 oh you've got this cuz you got the special programmers got all the commentaries of all the acharya's silk secondary result of directly perceiving the Lord whose natural form is the highest place is described here
 I don't care. So he said that the tree diagram teeth and not in the heart he's saying is that false ego this that does karate Free Die Hard
 Friday is sort of like you grow not cuz it's a not so the car is destroyed at this point he said what we've been hearing step-by-step UniFirst you start serving the devotees then you get this you know your step by step to misgivings or disappearing that you getting a true like real experience of God and so on and then this
 all of your ignorance
is cut all the doubts or destroyed it it's so amazing how the idea of once once establishing goodness the modes of passion ignorance release this is like the scientific understanding what's going on why am I so happy all the sudden cuz you no longer passion ignorance the things that you were attracted to they're not attractive anymore they were never making you happy in the first place now you have connection to source so it so you can send you the wrong card of the false ego is the free diet green tea which has destroyed all doubts about seeing the Lord are destroyed for those who hear about him and meditate on him by hearing thoughts about the non-existence of the Lord of destroyed by meditation mistake and thoughts concerning the Lord of destroyed
 however by direct perception of the Lord thoughts about non-existence of the Lord and Country thoughts are destroyed Karma's artist
diminished all of your stock load of reactions coming here with a shadow a Bossa of, Remains by the will of the Lord interesting that's I mean so much to be said about that that for the devotee they're working on to the Lord's the red guy and it may appear like they have, but it's just a shadow, it's not the real substance
 very interesting stuff thrown on the charger in a say in his memorization course they said he memorized this whole chapter is pretty great she still doing the memorization courses hasn't done one in a while but I'm going to bring back for that anyway it's great stuff isn't it do you want to get into where we're at now yeah right now
I'm hearing from
 you're in front of the Python man were talking about last time we talked about was Pamela one of our listeners was a divorce mediator how does that have to do with this real like we got to talk about this next time I forget remember what those let's see how this let's read the verse and see how it ties in with a divorce mediation so we can just maybe. Just a little of recap cuz they haven't did me yesterday but so provide the great king is interviewing this renuncia guess I can send you a c s of a do so he doesn't follow the normal kind of he's got his own thing going on and that is Eddie just lies in one place its extreme it's unusual it's not that we all have to become a guy that lies in the street and it's not even saying that we shouldn't be active or industrious in this world
but he's going to speak now in and kind of help us understand a certain principle and that principle is at the pursuit of unnecessary things in life it just consumes our minds when we get distracted from what's really important he's going to describe how it's really there's a really profound connection here
 that when are when our mind becomes consumed with the desire for things that are not necessary
 it's not only distracts us but it brings on anxiety there's a direct connection between pursuing unnecessary things which is kind of the opposite of simplicity
 and anxiety it's it's it's like you are just when you reach out for that unnecessary thing and try to pull that you're just pulling anxiety right towards you so he's speaking on this is this good stuff is real important stuff is what he says those were considered
really powerful right we look around the world like who's driving that car woo who's this who's this guy those were considered materially powerful and Rich are always
 fill with anxiety because of governmental laws right if you got the IRS ripe thieves and Rogues if you got stuff you got to worry about people stealing your stuff Anthony's Rikers sometimes when you have stuff people become envious of what you got first to give those to me like you could you can imagine people being fearful or upset it took all my money right as you know this is a fool right where they let you know they're trying to create some kind of security from thieves they have different enemies out that they're not together but you now he's sooo you but it goes on it just like even like that only these people that are like directly out to get you that cause you the same xiety it was on here than just family members are you
you're doing good I'm not doing good we brought some money or family members could be more difficult because like you have to live close with him yeah but they can mess up your life
 sorry so these are the people that are now at the next Wednesday curious so I get government and laws I guess it leaves I get Rogues I got enemies I get family members animals birds birds I don't know why birds were single that are animals and birds causing the wealthy problem I don't know maybe that your crops
 okay but your crops or perhaps you have like an expensive are at or something or can you say why animals but like the more you live out nature the more those animals you know we we live in this artificial world where all the animals been chased off but Grandma world's animals are coming right on up to you baby animals are your biggest fear
I mean we shouldn't try to take away write that down and then be problems they can think of Shelly cause anxiety they can definitely cause I'm sure they can eat all your various religious fly in and fly are they going to get over any fence you can build a fence for other animals but you know those birds yet but right now I'm seeking charity my mom's house and my mom's got some money yeah but not through it. She just figured it out I don't know she'd want to give her a call right now and see if she see if we sent any anxiety well you know what she's got no but I will say she's getting a lot everyday or mail is filled with people just trying to get her money
just like every Church in every charity is just trying to get her money okay people seeking charity what else she gives it to Bucks that's good she grew up in the depression the inevitable time-factor right they even have to worry about the inevitable time-factor time if that's something you worry about like oh yeah I'm getting older what happened and then of course they're very own selves they deal with their own mind their own their own issues their own senses.
 They are invariably afraid those who are powerful but really powerful and Rich these are all the things they've got working against them without any issues she want to read that commentary quick with her and it's a short I would love to love to read this here we go
 the world's the word spice Mart spice Mart
means from oneself because of attachment for money the richest person is even afraid of himself
 he fears that he may have a locked his money in an unsafe manner or you might have committed some mistake aside from the government and its income tax and aside from thieves even a rich man's own relatives are always thinking of how to take advantage of him and take away some of this money sometimes he's relatives are described as jennika desue which means Rogues and thieves in the guise of relatives therefore there is no need to accumulate wealth or unnecessarily Endeavor for more or more money the real business of life is to ask who am I to understand one's self once you understand the position of the living entity in this material world and understand how to return home back to godhead but that being said I know
a lot of people who listen to show
 there you that have money and they use the resources in good ways he kind of boil it down to the essence are he said the real business in life
 just ask who am I and that's of course he may be purposely alluding to a man in there cuz he could just be saying in general but you know there's Sonata Nana goswami when it came to force you to Tanya
 that's what he asked right I don't even know how people are saying I'm a big important man but I don't even know who I am you know for real and and and and and that was just after he retreated Tanya he was traveling we mentioned it the other day that he was traveling with a kind of a servant and that servant was thinking let me take some money he took some some gold coin it's right here like a gold coins and since it on goswami kind of caught on like when it got to this hoe
how the hotel owner was like treating the Mystic he was a Mystic he had a Mystic friend who said that these guys have a gold coins and and it's not going to take the coins he could sense that this guy is like treating them really too nice and there's something going on and so then he turned to his friend and said they are you carrying money and gold coins or something I said well yeah you know I just thought we might need them if they said he gave them to that man instead of here I want you to have these in the message and I was going to kill you tonight for these gold coins with it because that it wasn't no I don't find it weird at all because if you met sit on goswami you be like
 I was going to kill this man who's so
 so deeply
Pious and spiritual just for some money just for some money so he said I was going to kill you for these you do just keep them and Saint Augustine said you take them because if it's not you it's going to be someone else you're doing us a favor by taking this but then that Mac is at the bar that serves still was hanging on the one coin yeah he had one coin left and later on he sniffed that was he said you take that coin and you go ahead and go on your own now and I'll take care of myself right so that and then he was traveling free and free of all anxiety like all his anxiety anxiety anymore because he wasn't trying to maintain something that he didn't need
 and so in that way he became the street to Tanya and then even when he finally had a chance to question met him he finally had a chance to question him this is where you went this man that was he was on the highest levels of government management you no great wealth great prestige
I came there is it is these things are just distractions from from the goal of Life who am I was asking that question whether they have wealth or not
 then they're doing the real business in life and so if you're right right now we are there people that we know that a very wealthy but they're focused on that what is the real you know who am I what in describe self-realization to focus on sale for the they're not being distracted from because they're seeing their wealth in the context of that human goal of discovering self what is up to you that they have very little wealth but they're totally distracted you know what the fact is it has the power to distract it was not very careful yeah it is beautiful and Eve I mean the wealthy need to hear this because every finds them but everybody needs to hear this stuff because we'll all fall victims of greed we all illusion and we all fall victims of thinking here's another thing that the great thing that Jim Carrey said like I wish that
everybody became become rich and famous so they realize how useless it is like some people just feel like you know he's wealthy and he know he's doing a good thing I think I just need to be well if I could become wealthy then I could do so much good for the world won't have any guidance true but it's not like there's this illusion that thinks if I get to this financial you know I'm height or this financial step on the ladder then everything's going to be fine
 it's not a baby you just going to board you going to have more stuff or junk it doesn't it doesn't make worry go away worry is there as long as you're in Ashton ignorance and you know I think I'm as you're saying for people that don't have a lot of money little things the little ways in which they use that money can absorb them I like giving it to the end there's always one after the other like
recently you know I rather City bikes in New York r a c due without a helmet and they they they recently they raise the price on them is like you know I usually ride the election. The ones that aren't electric They Ride terrible it's just like it's like about go ahead and in the electric ones they used to be like $0.11 a minute
 and now they're like $0.24 a minute 20% Sam it is like just crazy you know crushing you in 10 days is like you to go and ride for now it's like it's like 15 bucks you know it's like you write 10 times you write 20 times you can buy yourself a bicycle you know and I realize I'd like to sometimes just go out and ride you know or did it so it is a common way are used for transportation or sometimes it's just good for me to write once I start thinking
I need to go buy but you can buy for it you can buy it at goodbyes for just over two hundred bucks I was impressed I've got to be much yes you can you can but but even if you do then you start to start looking for bikes like which pipe should I get and if you start to think about anything about you know it's like it begins to absorb you you know you can go around and you can borrow $219 if you want a simple bike like a fix or at a fixed gear bike who was it fixed your bike it's like 2024 in New York City of Pittsburgh to fix your bike is great it's flat nipple
 so my point is so then you speak your mind gets distracted in that and then when you get that you generally not fully satisfied with it
your mind becomes distracted by the next we're going to come on man look at me over here looking at I'm trying to keep a three-way conversation going on keep you going hardcore Henry the next person that was good point
 and what was it Go fund me page set up all we ever read this perfect. Go ahead okay well I just
 we finished it now I'm now I'm here those in human society or intelligent should give up the original cause of lamentation illusion fear anger attachment poverty and unnecessary labor
 the original cause of all these is the desire for Unnecessary prestige
and money why all these are very straight book this is from a guy laying in the street he's giving us advice right he's got a theme and it's team is Simplicity right right everybody's working really hard being really a dust industrious to try to find a situation in life where they're happy free of anxiety and enjoying life and he saying that lamentation illusion fear anger attachment all all these things they're coming about because we desire for Unnecessary Prestige people you know Prestige that's Spike you know the car that I got to get the more expensive car because when I drive that car I want people to look at me a certain way I need more expensive clothes because when I want people to look at me so do I need to the right house I need all these different things cuz I want people to see me in a particular way that's Prestige sure her Prestige for unnecessary
 Prestige and money is causing the anxiety we don't need to go there
sure
 you know I just want to add to this because in bhakti we said that you can use things like you can dress nice but do it too
 do it in a way that's part of you serving a bigger picture it's not don't do it for you you would say Okay suppose I'm going to be on a big podcast were interviewed on the television you got to look nice if you go in there like looking like you actually sleep on the street you may not get the desired effect across for say so you should look look nice at the same time you got to be careful even though we accept all these things that you know you can use it for your buddy said if they call you tomorrow I'll get you take things and you just use it for Christmas service you still got to be careful with that cuz sometimes you can say oh privileged Professional Service it's all for Christmas services at but it's actually for you it's not for Christmas service in Spring
it's for you it's or if it's for your ego so there is like a slippery slope with a slackline that we walk when we when we use the excuse all of this is for Christmas service at the same time we can use things or Krishna service that don't seem like we're coming off as the the quintessential renuncia it the quintessential thiagi
 makes sense it makes perfect sense
 moving forward
 exit exit 35
 now he's going to give the two he's going to knowledge he's right one that represents the industrious but distracted person and then what they're not even realizing and then the other one which is the one that he's kind of following
 okay here we go this is the B2B
I thought our two excellent spiritual Masters who give us exemplary instructions regarding had to be satisfied by collecting only a little and had to stay in one place not move I love you beyond nature analogies of the B is like this and what he's going to point of it I guess we wait a couple more voice cuz he's from the homily I have learned to be unattached to accumulating money brother money as good as honey anyone can kill its owner and take it away
 if I do not endeavor
 Express experts okay I do not Endeavor to get anything but I'm satisfied with whatever is achieved and its own way if I do not get anything I'm patient and uneducated like a python and I lie down in this way for many days American
how long do pythons like how how long did they go between eating like 2 weeks cuz sometimes you get a big animal and then they just have to lie there for a long time
 they must have like powerful Assets in their stomach to digest bone crazy and then they must have some powerful lining in their stomach otherwise how is it not eating up their own stomach yeah I mean there's got some info here give us some birthday
 info let's see generally pythons larger ones eat once every week or two that's a ball.
 Okay so there's a comparison between the the B which is the super industrious animal it's going out there it's bringing home the pollen right that's what they bring my mind
legs are full of it shake it out and it comes in a fly and then fly back out they got a whole Community working hard on it and they're producing this like Golden Delicious powerful healthy write a psychotic eyes kind of got all of it so it's healthy for your skin for healing sunburned Burns butt on your body for burns really what time so they create this like this incredible product they work so hard to do it and then some just comes and takes it all the way to text Andrea Kay she does. She's a beekeeper see that it's come and take the honey and I've been working so hard and in so he's trying to draw our attention to that principle write that
we can just look into the lives of people you know if we've mentioned this on the show before but like a lot of people that create this big nasty right
 and then it's in there in the bank and then they get old and then they're in the hospital and then the hospital just starts either way that mistake and then the guy again you know you know what movie I saw yesterday on the plane this is not a squirrel The Beekeeper The Beekeeper what is that he was on the
 he was on the Jason Statham yes I love this man and Crush right there guys just what he would actually some serious unbeatable
 in an assassin Elite assassin or something but he was with this lady and he just kept bees in this lady's farm this lady really hear from this older lady
and then this lady who is old and simple
 you know she got scammed by one of these you know you get these when they come fishing for people through the internet and she got scammed out of all of her well and then was it a tender swindler got a Tinder swindler it was one of these guys IL your Norton you know virus protection thing is running out but we can read it just click on this link and then sign up here and put your password in here and then the guy just scammed her out of everything it was her life savings and a charity she managed
 and then he seek revenge on us she had she had and she know she ended up killing herself so depressed
 it wasn't just wanted to crush the guy he project other people
any way to make a long story short is has to do with the be the beat keeper you sometime they say there is corruption in the hive so to speak and he handed you have to kill the queen sell it so the point is she was a have you yet to prove that this wasn't a square hole killing the queen why has she was to have she had money and the people were just trying to get that well from her that's okay that's a photo that was it and it happens in so many ways to write it it happens in reversing the stock market we lose it you know we have to pay it away and taxes we have to you know we have to spend it at you know in the hospital when we're going all the way in so many different ways and had to intervene with their
