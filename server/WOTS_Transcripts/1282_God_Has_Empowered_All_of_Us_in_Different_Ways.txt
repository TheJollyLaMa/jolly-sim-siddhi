 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Alachua Florida this is wisdom of the ages of Dale yoga podcast with your host rub it off and co-host and Senior educator the box of Central New York because stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome to Tuesday study the stream about what I'm happy to be here having to be here with the tell you people come up to me and I watch with the other day at school are pretty in Festival they're like how do you do it everyday I was like I do it against my will every day some days I'm really into doing this and some days I don't want to do it I'm angry at God the universe cuz scuba but you know there's something about like
having some personal accountability I think in our spiritual path it's good to have some type of personal accountability we need friends partners that are going to hold us to some of the commitments hold us to a particular standard to do good things even when we don't feel like doing them but today I feel good today I'm feeling good about life in general will go to Rota yeah and happy I'm here and I'm doing a program tonight in the last one actually if you anyone is in the Alachua Gainesville area of doing a private home program you can direct message me I'll give you info I got to order I put it on my stories who sort of set it up for teens but it doesn't matter of your team actually and there's going to be prashad
 18225 your 26 you can't we we ID people at the door but she says she doesn't care if she's like whoever whomever I will not but it's at the house we're staying at really wonderful family
yeah so if you're interested direct message me and I still like the first real day back in one sense because you know I landed here had to do to take care of your initial stuff if you haven't been in your home for 5 months yeah then where in upstate for a couple days in meetings with you and Linda Linda Linda yeah and then come back down here and had a couple teacher trainings to do and then of course corporativa Festival which is great and like yesterday was like kind of the first day back and I said you know what I got to get right into reading the book so I went to my favorite Library half a
 no Library
 and you know what that Natural History Museum they got this new wing and they got like a beautiful library in there so I got just a few blocks from where I live and got back into and it was wonderful.
into the writing process by the thinking about you and all the work that you did put together your Memoir and now it's coming out what's what's the latest news on the latest news that just came out in Danish of all translations of the Danish translation and then cool but yeah if I could ask a favor of everybody go to my Instagram stories and share share the real I just put up it's just the advertisement I really need a surge of people from we had a big surge we advertised it like 4 months ago but it's actually coming out very soon so if you could yeah just share it on your stories with people or maybe just get a copy for someone who you feel is on a spiritual journey and that might appreciate something that people are a little stuff and they can find themselves in someone else's story and that's what I'm hoping the story is not for you to become me but it's for people to sort of
see themselves in another in another is Journey and for me was it was very cathartic to write it took me four years to write and I didn't have a Ghostwriter that but I had a lot of editors chopping away at stuff to me
 really helped me see God in my life when you look back when you write your life story and you're a spiritual minded person you see how God is always handing you opportunities like I'm handing you a mango or something and you're just like nope don't want the mango and then sometimes you take the mango something to smell the mango x u b the mango but God was always handing you that mango and so that's one thing it really sort of reminded me about that God is real and is active in my life on a regular basis
and there's hope and the distress in the the challenges I went through and that we all go through it sometimes these challenges are super extreme and sometimes your lights and themes are there so it like a worse world's struggle but whatever challenges were going through that there is some Divine Force energy higher power God that is putting those in our way for us to climb higher and higher and higher and that was my take away when I actually finished the book I felt like now you climb to the top and was a now you climb to the top and it was time to write the book
 I definitely I'm on the climb I'm going to climb I'm going to climb and then hopefully I'm at like Everest Base Camp right now
 but the more you climb then that's the thing I think about spiritual life is like the more you climb the more you realize how much more there is to climb but at least there is some directional you know some some idea of their is the direction
we're moving and that we are in the next important to move forward it is important that happened to the hell you can look back down and see the progress that you made
 yeah yeah for sure I definitely I would have some time when I was a new devotee practicing body I would ask older devotees and Blake have you changed can you honestly say you've changed and I would say do you think
 you're transforming are you just going along with this or actually you changing and I think in order for me to develop faith on the path I want to hear people stories like but I can save my own life like I've become a different person. How to become a different person and I'm and I'm grateful to the the culture of wisdom in The Vedic tradition and not just not just the wisdom but the culture of wisdom you know what I mean you have to culture it like a cultured yogurt at midnight and there's a there's a process of applying it and working it
it works if you work it you know and sell when you work it into your life
 you should you change and if it's different than just having a bunch of wise books on your shelf that okay read that when I read that when I read that one I wanted more than just like reading books of wisdom I wanted a method to apply it to my life and that was like the gift that bhakti yoga gave me and I'm very grateful for it and I'm noticing in myself and other people on this path no matter how long you been on the path the material world is designed to crack you down to nothing but liked it to nothing except actually what you are it seems like harsh but it's not harsh to take a hammer and smash a macadamia nut it seems harsh but the real
Joy the real beauty of that macadamia nut is once the shells off and so all of my bravado and Persona and and representation of who am representing myself to the world that has to be almost crapped crushed for me to get to that like the Juicy Juice Enos that an under that is that is me or that is us so that the cracking in the material world as it is is it actually a very beautiful thing are lost our heartbreak or betrayal our Good Fortune it's all to sort of like strip us down until our essential being and when we get there we can actually find yourself and find her a real sense of self I was just with the names but he's such a wonderful devotee
 you just sharing it isn't really people that you know you and me are crazy watch we made some bad choices in their life he's one of these
eyes and nice Brahmin family Indian family who's made every right choice every good choices honesty and the world the universe just cracked him open so hard to the point where he's like angry at Krishna why would you do this to me but when you see him come out the other side it is so glorious and beautiful you know it's like you take those books off the shelf and you take them into your heart
 and you just get purified by them through all your trouble through all your troubles so anyway yeah I am grateful for everything we have and in the book has just been to come a manifestation of it and if you really want to help me or you like what we do share it on your stories today or you don't get a copy for a friend on Amazon it means means the world to me thank you very much that's all I'm going to say that just a few days
time 2 weeks 2 weeks 2 weeks but you know what it looks really good to the Retailer's if it's pre-ordered and we had a huge surge they said there was like such a big because when it comes out it it makes a big difference now is the time now what's the time okay
 announcements
 Miss Murder
 good morning we're back to Recovery Group meetings today the men meet at noon and the women meet at 2 we also have in-person meetings in Nashville and Alachua electric that's good news some people riding on the board hey can I just get it at one of your events
answer is maybe I don't have that many copies so the last two events they all sold out so better just to get it on Amazon and then her I have yeah so I'm not positive I can bring it to get an autograph yeah then you can bring to the show I didn't get mine I think you know what cuz you walked out of the house and it has like you forgot to give them the book and she was going to chase I walked out of the house I have to walk out the house at some point I know but I wanted to write you a love note you know that she was right she was ready to chase you don't chase the car down and I was like you know let him let him go out I want to write him a special note you're going to get one but it's a special okay
 okay did you get it yeah but it takes my phone so I don't scroll during the podcast so she's giving it back now here's the Nugget
 is it from
it is from what you mean
 James Gustave know that's his middle name James to starve
 okay okay he is an American Environmental Lawyer and scientist and Advocate who co-founded the natural resources defense Council so still alive
 I would imagine he has 42 but he's 83 years old and 42
 okay I used to think usually says more context as an Environmental Lawyer and I his work for presidents and then you know he's some kind of made it his
 his service in Life 2
try to protect the environment through legal and political channels
 well here's what he has to say kaszuba
 I used to think the top environmental problems for biodiversity loss ecosystems collapse and climate change I thought was I thought with 30 years of good science we could address those problems but I was wrong
 wow this is an older old man now so now he's like this what this is his mature realization that was wrong the top environmental problems are selfishness greed
 an apathy and to deal with those with spiritual and cultural transformation and we the lawyers and scientists don't know how to do that
do you know I like that one that was like exactly that lady in the airport that came to run that's why me and what do you Swami's doing about our environment just sitting there and chanting all day and you know that's from a from Radha soami spoke the journey within
 I saved it right here I got it he said that thinking the same here same me was I think it just left for knob and he was sitting in the Delhi airport about the fly somewhere
 and I can read what he said he said after I reach the airport
 I waited at the gate for my flight we have come directly from Vern David where I just let a pilgrimage of thousands of pilgrims for two weeks I was hoping for some time to sit quietly.
 And yet a few minutes in the airport you think okay maybe I could just like 6
doing what we're doing on a massive level we get exhausted sometimes talking to 40 people I need a break is that like thousands of people are you talking to and then after that class is over about 40 people surrounded by was manika Gandhi Gandhi the union Minister for environment and forests in India and the daughter-in-law of former prime minister Indira Gandhi she wants to talk to me I obliged to be stood up walked over and greeted me Namaste swami-ji after plasma exchange she's suddenly challenged me
 what are you what are you spiritual leaders doing to protect the ecology she was passionate and very serious every second the air is being saturated with cancer smog she said tons of raw sewage and toxic waste are dumped our the into rivers were millions of people bathe and drink what do you politicians doing it
hello that the Earth is being stripped of its Forest has become a Dumping Ground for deadly waste the world is on the brink of ecologically disaster while all of you spiritual the submitting are praying what is your devotion doing to save the ecology
 so marriage continues her concern was real and impassioned it was exciting to see the depth of concern from a powerful leader over an issue that affects us all she induced me to ponder my own commitment yes I responded the environment is everyone's responsibility and I sincerely admire your tireless commitment
 many of the spiritual leaders I know believe that along with passing laws and doing the cleaning work we need to address the root cause of the problem if a person is covered with boils the symptom must be treated like the scent of the symptoms must be treated but unless the cause of the problem is address to boil
recur in a case of boils
 cause maybe a disease in the blood the root cause of pollution in the world is pollution in the heart did you ever boils
 okay this is right now and it's a it's a horrible but it is now she is great because we want to the boil causes so much pain is like a pimple that if you were to touch a gigantic nipple and a touch it it hurts if it's on your but you cannot sit down and you know and it is just almost like it's throbbing sometimes and if you sort of blow on a boy like it makes it feel cool and nice but the idea is blowing on a boil does not remove the boil it just it remains there for a moment and also till like Lance the boil if you really want to get really ugly here at
in the morning for 7 the morning to Lance that boil is it's not going to get rid of it because as soon as it goes away you treat it there's another one coming back so this analogy is about like getting to the heart of it getting to the root of it with your diet like whatever is causing that imbalance in the blood that's the root cause even if you deal with it on the external level is going to come back soon so I'll write a song about the root cause of pollution in the world is pollution in the heart if we successfully clean the air Sky every river and every ocean
 it is for certain that people will pollute them again unless they were formed the Ecology of their hearts toxic greed is contaminate the minds of human society the environment is simply an external manifestation of the Ecology of the mind so well said right greed is an obsession and a dick
it can never be quenched the more it gets the more needs greed hardens the heart and fools us into rationalizing cruelty and justifying crime
 greed and Deuces Envy divides families provokes Wars and blinds us to a real self-interest Greed for money power Fame text the world is ravaged by greed it is practically an exercise in futility to attempt to clean the environment when politicians are corrupted by bribes industrious pollute rivers to maximize profits and scientists put aside their ethics for funding the bug of agita states that greed is a symptom of a video or a nurse that covers the natural virtues of the self of the true self within us
 so that's
 that's what he say
is it the same exact thing that you're getting from Gus speth you know who did this person that's working so hard apparently you know to try to do something good through the legal systems and all that that's really important work in in in Robesonia not minimizing that he said that's real important
 but he's saying we all have to work and we all have different responsibilities
 yeah I think she went on to say that he said it's all we also discuss how crucial it was to educate the public even many pies people participate and unnecessarily endangering the environment may be good and good in hard but due to lack of awareness they may be destroying the environment not understanding that what may seem convenient like dumping Industrial Waste into a river is actually killing fish animals in people so long with the pollution of a Rivers we must give attention to pollution of our hearts miss Connie listen to Tenley and gently nodded as I continued so he goes on
not like this but
 yeah I see you on here saying what he says
 God has empowered all of us in different ways that such a nice man it's like that God has empowered us all in different ways sure if we agree on what the real problem is then we can all contribute are part of the solution
 the well-being of Mother Earth is everyone's problem it is crucial for leaders in all fields in all fields to serve cooperatively this point it is a simple thing but it like we can we can become so blind to it God is empowered us all in different ways let's let's honor the differences let's appreciate one another and let's all try to let's all try to unite right round truth what is a notice what the environmental cleanup is it starts with the own your own mind my mind is not clean it doesn't matter how much I bathe wear nice clothes
if I have if I'm like addicted to lust or Warren or greed or taking and trying to see differences in our cells between gender and race that's a problem it doesn't matter how externally clean I have to even leave it it's it's it's only a matter of time before it collapses so from The Roots what I saw when I was a young man was this is actually the most important thing this is actually the Keystone you know where the key to actually change the world is actually to really dig deep and go internal with my shortcomings with my internal pollution and not just like yell and point fingers at the external pollution
 and then you might be in a position of importance you never know or you might influence a person of influence you know and that that's a big that that that's how that's how I see things
tangibly changing
 think about that while he said that at that point Miss Miss Gandhi had bobbled and what she had to do was call The Border flight she nodded her head and I she stood up and smile Tim yes or maybe what you say is true the time has come we all need to work together but he goes on in this is important you know he says she was right to take me to tasks religious and spiritual leader should be held accountable for environmental activism not only because they have access to large communities and can influence votes in this is really nice right okay that's the only part of it but because service is integral to religious and spiritual life and other was his understanding you know
 it's not something
 exterior 22 spiritual life but is part of it have had you know the right attitude the right mood of Simplicity and so-and-so
is there any good in that that was the basic message I always appreciate that you know the wisdom what real wisdom is like you take Arya Veda friend since you were saying like
 it has the the emphasis lies more on preventative measures
 then it doesn't therapeutic mattress in other words if we eat right if we sleep right if we live right then you can avoid most of the diseases you know I'm rather than trying to come up with the cure for the disease and and there's a wisdom and living like that you know because we're feeble-minded in so many ways we tend to always seek the comfort of Secrets trailer or whatever the wiser person could kind of see that that
 did any life
dial
 that doesn't have a strong element of Simplicity in it whatever it is that you're chasing a kind of comes back at you in one form or another and the next same
 kind of dynamic do you know what it takes place in micro and macro ways and a Big Mac or away is what we see happening in environment yes we need to do all that we can to help fix it but what rule really fix it it's if we all have very different attitudes about what successes and what will make us happy until I'm sure
 those are you ready to go get into it yeah Prabhu yes it was lovely to told you I'm in the area before starting to shoot my bag what time which is a very means of Conquest when should offer respectful a basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan and to Nardin trying to reach you the super most human being a nurse watching the goddess of learning and she let be off today of the author

 chapter 7 chapter 7
 next one where the beginning of the chapter what's the chapter entitled entitle what prologue learned in the womb get his early childhood education pre-birth education it its own
cuz remember we go back for Loudon the previous chapters giving such a nice instructions to all the young little braids and they were like well where do you learn this cuz you definitely didn't learn out here in this kind of stuff from his teachings on busty and so on your not here in this kind of stuff from our teachers and you don't they don't even let you out of the palace
 so where'd you learn this stuff
 interesting how it like the womb is a place you can fax you what was the mother does with the weather here is what the mother eats who the mother hangs I feel heartbroken when someone takes their little baby to a hardcore shows like what are you crazy ladies pregnant is that the hardcore shows like I don't want these like you know Gibson Les Paul and Marshall amplification do the first sound in this child's ears
listen to that kid you got to sing to the kid your mind has to be in a great
 in a great place at 8 on one beautiful lady that was pregnant was getting really upset about some political issue and she wrote me she's like how my supposed to go forward in my life all the politics that are going on right now and everyone so hateful and the more I read about it the more hateful I get

stressed out what we'll read about it some other a lot she was yeah she was listening to kirtan on Spotify on a regular basis your kids in the world yeah I'm sing to the Joe champ to the womb did you give right up. I did what did you say I like your tone of my house and only that with the babies were born I brought them in front of the DD's they offered them to the deities and rang a bell accept this offering the baby it's yours, I did offer the babies we offer everything we have is devotees be up for a boys so I thoughts are actions are skills in our babies
 I'm so yeah that Naruto is being a scene where'd you learn this he's going to say I turned it in the womb County of soncini Rights
mother took me to a ZZ Top concert when I was about 25 yes see Tanya that's why I've got ghost volume troubles in your life is easy top my parents took me to I see The Godfather when I was five is that crazy it would do that that was an Italian thing was like Italian thing if I was in town I was scarred from that film OK Google text 13 about to take it to court at 2
 Naruto movies said she was born in a family of a sewer has who's the greatest of all devotees having that's being questioned by his class friends the sons of the sewer as the demons he remember the words spoken to him by me and reply to his friends as follows
plumber said when her father or any cuz she poo went to Monday rajala Mountain to execute severe austerity has in his absence the demigods had to buy Kendra made a severe attempt to subdue all the demons in the in Warfare so incredibly powerful Tyrant he went off to perform these are stairs to become more powerful and interested now's our chance let's take everything back well
 alas as a serpent is eaten by small ants so the Troublesome hiranyakashipu who's always inflicted miseries Upon A all types of people has now been defeated by the reactions of his own sinful activities saying this the demigods headed by King Indra arranged to fight the demons
 I can't attack
when the great leaders of the Demons who are being killed one after another saw the unprecedented exertion of the demigods in fighting the began to flee the scattering them excuse me scattering themselves in all directions simply to protect their lives they hastily fled from their homes wives children animals and household paraphernalia
 wouldn't you think that means household paraphernalia or paying no heed to all these all of all of these the demons simply fled
 Victorious demigods plunder the Palace of her any cashew Pooh the king of the demons and destroyed everything within it then injura King Of Heaven arrested my mother Queen
I knew she was pregnant
 and they feared that his ever in your car supposed to send it would just be more of the same cuz that was the deal that was nothing in the families even like the mafia family like you killed my father I'm going to go back and get you you know so they felt like you got any going after Friday cashew Pooh now that the sun is going to seek revenge on me
 they sentence Bill diplomatically and then it was a cruel thing you want to kill little child little Sunny little know a little Don Corleone when he was little boy he had to leave Italy because you know if you're bringing back all the trauma prep still trying to get sunny at the toll booth out of my mind on the Long Island Expressway as she was being led away
running in fear like a car re captured by a Bulger it's interesting what is a vultures go after living animals I thought they only go after the death in the womb I think some people play like whale sounds don't like what are you talking about can we go on please I was making a relevant, just don't kill live birds and you brought it to Wale songs in the womb know we're talking about in the womb like different sounds people play for the babies in the world I'm going to give you a Harry Krishna I'm shocked Harry Krishna what you should not drag her off in this merciless way
 okay so enjoy do king of the demigods this woman is
sinless you should I drag her off in this way this wouldn't already said greatly fortunate one this chase woman is the wife of another you must immediately release her so it's so interesting. It's like thinking in this political power and kind of mindset Naruto who's like this total bhakti say just like saying
 you can't treat her this way there's like codes of warfare you know you can't take the wife of like the warrior even if he is your enemy
 but now he just got his argument text King Andrew said listen in the womb of this woman the wife of the demon hiranyakashipu is the seed of that great demon
 demon seed
 therefore let her remain in our custody until her child is delivered and then we shall release her what do you do with the baby going to kill the baby Harry Krishna
Krishna Naruto Moody replied I love using Harry Krishna for anything else than chanting the Holy Name
 I like using your Society takes a Krishna alright reply
 the nerd Emoji replied the child was in the this woman's womb is faultless and sinless indeed he is a great devotee a powerful servant of the Supreme personality godhead therefore you will not be able to kill him
 when the Great st. Rita Mooney had last spoken King Indra how to debate being respectful of nardis words immediately released my mother
 because of being a devotee of the Lord all the demigod circumambulate at her then they returned to their Celestial Kingdom
interesting is circumambulate her like there's a great devotee and her they honored him
 because of my being okay they're not honoring her they were honoring the baby
 they're honoring the baby seems to me like he's saying there's this great saying inside her it's like Mary and Jesus
 I like that
 11 hours continued the great Saint Bernard and Mooney brought my mother to his ashram and assured her of all protection saying my dear child please remain at my Armstrong until the arrival of your husband this is getting more and more like the Nativity scene isn't it went to the ashram episode of the manger of sorts
 I'm sure they had cows for boo you don't know that's a speculation well where it's an ashram it take care of cows in the ostrom's after
in the instructions of devarshi Narda my mother stayed in his care without fear from any direction as long as my father the king of the daityas the demon demon race had not become free from a severe austerities
 missionary father is just working hard being a demon he's like he's working harder to be the best demon he can be good qualities of determination and you know you do raise the bar but it's all towards demonic to be a better demon that was his takeaway be a better demon Yoga Yoga there's practicing well yeah it's like real yoga real top us to be better at being bad determination mindfulness you know Focus
mr. focused on raising the bar for good to resurrect your spiritual life if you're focused might be filled with mindfulness
 you know I'm concentrating on your breath you know it all means nothing unless it's for our spiritual life because you could be a mindful demon you could be a focus demon you could be like working hard and determined to be a better demon that's what it was
 bear with it down and get a mug be better demon mug
 Move Along move along like that would be a great mug
 so we just said your mother out of that
 okay
 okay
 okay my mother being pregnant desire the safety of her embryo and desired to give birth after her
husband's arrival that she stayed at Nardo's ashram where she rendered service on to Narda Mooney with great devotion nice people married demons
 and then you're stuck with them this is to all the nice people out there that married a demon
 Naruto Mooney delivered his instructions both to me who was in within the womb and to my mother who was engaged in rendering him service because he is naturally extremely kind to Fallen Souls being in a transcendental position he gave instructions on religion and Transit until knowledge these instructions were free from all material contamination so that's where he learned it that's the message of the bog about that's the message of transcendental truth you overlook their position and you.
what do I was Samara you're taller and compassionate and loving
 you're taller and compassion and loving and that's how we got in the bhakti because people despite our lack of qualification you and I were not some you know Ramen boys Lower East Side Dirtbag Punk's right but people were compassionate tolerant and loving
 and they overlooked our shortcomings we are very rough around the edges I was a little rougher than you but they just talk and they just spoon-fed us bhakti with little eye droppers as much as we could take in and they just Overlook their shortcomings and that snap map that's the way we pay it forward with other people were compassionate we're tolerant we're loving when people inquire why you doing this but instead of like lashing out you filthy meat-eater you don't you
if you've got a person you're living with perhaps that you feel like it's just not up to par and you're just shaming them on a regular basis to get them to change its what doesn't work so good
 person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still they'll do it cuz I don't want to be ashamed but the hold a resentment in their heart but if you can change and influence by loving my tolerance by compassion and then by I dropping wisdom and knowledge
 I dropping now cuz I dropped like a like a little like a little pink sure you have that much body you don't have to hit him with a bhakti sledgehammer which often times is like my own personal insecurities anyway
 I tried that approach doesn't work well so he learned in the womb that's where you got it
 dirty money deliver distance
which is both to me whose within the womb and to my mother who is engaged in rendering him service because he's okay just read that text 16 because of the long duration of time that has passed and because of her being a woman and therefore less intelligent what trigger
 yes
 she's less intelligent she was a woman my mother has forgotten all those instructions for the Great Sage Naruto blessed me and therefore I cannot forget them okay I'm going to get a trigger trigger alert on that one too stupid or do you want to have a cultural thing why would they say that
 my understanding and you know what what a Tyson let you know when I hear this kind of stuff it's kind of like
 nails scratching on a chalkboard and see what cringey there's there's so much to so much valuable
 life changing Harmony creating love expanding instructions that's really what all these texts
about it is it's hard expanding its love expanding its internal cleansing but then that statement like this to me like drop me all the way back you know and so much of it has to do with seeing the spiritual equality of all living beings
 and it kind of recognizing that deeper spiritual Essence in this seem to speak directly against that and and not only that but it seems to also provide the perfect kind of
 the perfect kind of instruction that can be used as an impressive tool sure hat so how do you
 how do you rationalize that or understand it and move forward like this
 that
 certainly men and women have different
 differences and that's something that that's real that's on that's biological that's something that's you know we have different hormones running through a body it's like it's like we've had want you two men have had one
injected into the bloodstream we would have had another Blood you know drug inject into their bloodstream so they certainly are biological differences that play out psychologically that's a that's a that's a medical fact we shouldn't try to ignore that
 right we should recognize and now certainly that these are General categories hat how that plays out in each person has is going to be different but but there are differences now
 having said that if we go back to the ancient texts and in the trend that existed over thousand years ago in India which is hard to understand because we live in a hole it's hard to understand what was it like when my mom was growing up with the speak of 4,000 Years Ago by better you never hear that the vamps this was on Gianna yoga the emphasis was on the Upon a Child in the Upon a Child
all of life is presented as something that the chief to hardcore Annunciation meaning cold-hearted unsentimental discernment like walking away from your family do you say you know what my family I have to mentally categorize these people is not particularly dear they're just bodies and names and ever-changing see of transformation like the big zoom out like you're not my children anyway you're not my wife anyway I'm going to cut that emotional bond that I'm going to walk away was seeing as the path to spiritual Freedom. That's that's what was out of all of yesterday's works that's what was extracted and seen as the goal and the mail psychology is
 generally and I say this generally generally more analytical and the female psychology is generally more compassionate and tender and affectionate nurturing
 so fun do Panasonic organic angle
the male psychology would be better suited for that Moksha you know that that goal of Gianna yoga full on detachment
 but when we when we come to back to you know when you come to the osses message is expanded in full
 which we find this particular in the Bible time
 then we learned that bhakti becomes the goal not not attached for not renunciation but it's actually
 the cultivation of once tender emotions you know like one doesn't need to kill their tender emotions right when it comes to body and now we see this that feminine
 psychology is actually glorified you know it it's in the stories of like the wives of the Brahmin has you know where the woman's understanding was so Superior to that of their super qualified dating right
hope he's being glorified is the highest of all yogis so booked is a yoga path of cultivating tender emotions. Killing them
 and it's just a matter of the ideas you just need to focus of tender emotions on God first and then through God they go to ever live in bed every living being in and that's the one this is aimed at right is not the one that's of stepping away from my family and seeing them all as a list of names it's the one is of seeing every living being with love through God so you know recognizing that spiritual Oneness in in in in in there is revealed his final message as revealed in the bar with Tom
 is that through applying your emotional intelligence in this way one becomes a much much greater much Superior tended to the greatest Gianni's or the greatest Yogi's so another words to be a hardcore gani
 the male psychology is advantageous and that's where they
kind of instructions, cuz you're a little heartless heartless the female psychology the female disposition is not only not an impediment in achieving you always high goal but it's actually an advantage and that was like the wives of the Brahmin us the wives environment Brahmin us were quote less intelligent but they were that good but they were the two follow their footsteps was the goal of that story their husbands were intelligent they were the most intelligent but they were missing the wisdom you hear this story played out in the beta's I'm just I feel like it's almost like
 lost in a time in a culture when these statements come out like women these hurt you know these are like this
how do you say people do in modern times with a study different types of intelligence and they say like when it comes to like empathy
 the ability to understand and relate to the emotional experiences of others you know people that have a high level of empathy they're able to demonstrate compassion and and a willingness to help those around him they have this awareness of others they can perceive and discern different moods and different thoughts they can interpret nonverbal cues and in people's body language or in the facial expressions they can grasp like subtle nuances and conversations women tend to do much better in that than men do
 and Men tended to kind of like you don't be more Progressive with the ability to like regulate once moods you know bounce back from negative emotions and someone so they're different types of intelligence but I'll say this this is maybe the essence of what I would really like to share about this for people that are cracked
can I hear some like that and I totally get my feelings don't let this slow you down don't let this not only involved in general but him to show the proper cuz she'll probably expressing things he's coming from another culture when he expresses then he may not always be
 sensitive and he expresses himself as his English is not my second I'm going to make our mistakes and how I communicate this but those women that were his directive siples
 that's served with him in spreading bhatti that were right there with him and and and even they were coming from feminist backgrounds they've always good things to say they have nothing but with it and you know I wanted to read I have two little excerpt from letters that proper wrote to his to his disciples 1222 to one of his me to 8801 probably do like look at you go. So he's right this
the letter to divide a diamond Chandra and in what I want to illustrate hear what these letters illustrate is that proper recognize that like the ancient tradition women were in the background in a certain sense at least when it came to like publicly teaching and insulin
 the property was actually very proud
 that his disciples were kind of taking it into a new era
 I think especially it'll say that in the second thing but let's see this is a letter to bring Dom and children in 1970
 great name David showing his own son that's right but this isn't he said so accept it is a great so accepting always krishna's Supreme advisor and always begging for his Mercy go on with your Progressive March and I'm very satisfied with your activities but a nice letters in I'm so glad to learn that you're good
is also helping you that is the duty of a faithful companion in life it's a wife is helpful in the spiritual progress of life she is the best friend and philosopher very interesting right I probably didn't just say even the best friend or the best companion he said the best friend Philosopher's Stone Krishna Consciousness the wife is never a burden but she's completely a counterpart so set example to your countrymen how younger generation can live peacefully husband and wife being engaged in Christmas service there are many examples of this type of husband and wife working together no different centers he was real for propagating this Sublime messages so he is saying this wife these these women that these two great philosophers he was proud that they be upfront and that really comes out in this neck so this is Tim Abba T if you know the type of his written in
 December of 1969 he says so I must I am especially proud of how
my householder disciples are preaching or cheat on his mission this is a new thing in the history of the sun kirtan movement in India all the acharya is all the great teachers in the past and their descendants later on acted only from the man's side their wives were at home because that is the system from all times and women are not required to go out but if we find the women are also equally confident like the men in the matter of Krishna Consciousness movement please they are for Terry on these missionary activities and prove it by practical example and there's no bar or anyone in the matter of preaching work for Krishna Consciousness so here we have exams were probably just like not only okay and green lighting women stepping up be coming into the Forefront becoming teachers becoming philosophers becoming communicators
 but he was actually really proud of it and that his disciples
doing this and even that they were setting a new trend and kind of even kind of breaking some of the traditional roles this of course was Indian the 60s or 70s which were it's still wasn't
 happening in that regard your Hap's so it's so I totally get it when we hear some like that is cuz you can be very hard to hear I hate being put in the position of like an apologist for it but try to try to dig deeper into it and really understand I think we all can
 she had to have a balance point of view we should understand our differences we should welcome that we should honor them it kind of gets back to what Radha soami said to that woman in the in the airport right like we all have these different gifts let's recognize that and and and and even in an in recognizing the generalities that exists let's appreciate the gifts that both sides have and let's also not cry
any barriers to where someone can't fully Express you're fully blossom into whatever role they're meant to play in this world whatever that they can contribute to know let's not create any barriers for people that's open up those barriers and I think probably did that practically and so when I hear statements like this I bounce them out with knowing how properly applied it especially I've known personally a lot of those early ladies in the movement to
 like a moon and a Chaka so many wonderful things to say it's important to understand things the whole context of a person's life yes okay amaris got some takeaways
 make mugs for me
 God is always handing us opportunities mangoes
 apply and culture
wisdom
 culture live cultured yogurt and material world is designed to crack your shell off like a macadamia nut breakfast that desires
 take the books off the shelf and into your heart I like that a lot too. There we love to consume things and that but I bought my time set on my shelf I love the fact that we're forced in one sense but if you're showing up on a regular basis to open those books and not just keep a painting on the wall it's like you got to get into those they consider people shells for years without cracking them open
 selfishness greed and apathy of the real-world problems
reform the Ecology of the heart and mind
 we talked about reform school yesterday writing form School
 God empowers us all in different ways playing hooky from God don't play hooky from God
 devotees offer everything their voice skills and babies offer your baby's kids your baby brother
