 should we go right to our nugget unless you have some secret announcements I've got nothing you got nothing
Brooklyn this weekend Prema yoga she want to do it I think Friday night and Sunday morning
 so what are going to be Prema yoga Brooklyn look that up and
 if you're interested we were at school
 all right well here's the Nugget and this is a good is a great nugget actually I like it it's amazing how some of these are so Krishna conscious you know and it's four Miles Davis I really don't know much about deal I know he's a jazz musician who plays trumpet
 you know it's considered one of the primary you know figures in modern Jazz real music like myself but like real musicians I feel like there's some there's some type of higher beings I feel unless I say they're like some type of higher beings
to our Planet 2
 bless us with some sounds that there's planets of musicians you know that you must know that the darvas or plant planets of musicians everybody's musician there I think so I think that's part of their like I think hers just like part of being born on Earth is what we argue a lot. We have big egos or bumble around part of their qualities is that they are expert at music by Miles Davis who knows what he was but that's my yes some type of like higher being and they have some that they feel like musicians because they're artists they have some special insight and they can sort of bike
 I think
channeled from their planet or something comes through them anyway
 here's what Miles Davis said he says sometimes you have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself to play a long time to be able to play like yourself but you got to be able to if you're a trumpet player a guitar player or a drummer you got to sort of like to find your own first you have to become great at it to find your own nests in it but art is the same way painting you know you can follow all the instructions martial arts has the same way you know you got two feet you follow the perpendicular and parallel is this is how you move here you got to get classically trained and then creativity comes out and you start to find yourself
 what do the bhakti version of that now
is how we always kind of connected yeah I see a connection there for sure yeah
 you know there there's you know we are speaking yesterday that our theme was on Leela and on Russia that there's this that Christian isn't involved in place and that there is somehow we're playing another game
 you know it's like you know when you get to these big existential questions
 and thinking I think the average mind
 is not willing to really entertain really far-out ideas although I don't think there's any rationale to that I think as a matter fact I think if you're going to try to explain all. It is going to be something very far out and you know either way you know whether you're believing in a big bang that's definitely very far out idea is very far
believing in some kind of creation but what are you know this theology in a boxy see ology saying that there is this all powerful omnipotent being
 nnn and then it goes into the heart of that being you know what what is it that that interest that being or what is it that
 turns out being on you know what what are they all about and what we hear from the stage is over here through bog what time is it really becomes clarified involved with time like a really gets into it right you you're not going to find this kind of detail in in the office earlier works but he really began so late on the box time that you have this personal Christmas called recipe Hari you know like the relish of Russia and that's who he is or Russell Raja you know the King of Prussia like it's what he's all about is through this Play Tasty in these flavors of love
and if you are all-powerful but you want to have some Adventure what is Adventure if you're all-powerful it's like it's not nothing right it's like when
 to go to another Seinfeld do you remember that one would like Kramer he's like studying martial arts and really getting into it and then other people like Jerry and they're like oh you know martial arts but then you see like he's doing against little kids he just likes a girl from all over the place so it's like what's the point you know there's really no taste in that there's no Adventure in that this does nothing to overcome there's no excitement so Krishna although he's all-powerful is he
 222 part of what shows it is all-powerful is that he can become he could his own energy he can become subject to his own energy and other ways you can voluntarily get lost
 in the play so that he can experience the depths
Avril said that he wishes to experience now we we got out on our way
 on our YouTube channel we got a comment from someone I couldn't quite make out their name but do they share a little something from one it is so probably, turn to the third verse of the Bible time
 which speaks of Russia right it says it's is glorifying Barbra time that this 000-000-0000 expert and thoughtful people relishing the baggage on this is how boxing opens up right it's like we're getting to the most esoteric and beautiful part of all of y'all's lives at work so expert and thoughtful people
 that's who this is for right people that are thoughtful enough not to be thinking I want two things of this world what God can I worship you get it no no no for expert and thoughtful people
 relishing Bobbitt on the mature fruit
of the desire tree The Vedic literature is right this is where it's all been building up to it emanated from the lips of shizuka David goswami you know the most you know widely accepted by everybody except that he was just completely otherworldly completely transcendental there for this fruit has become even more tasteful
 although its neck Terry and Juice was always well as relish bowl for all including liberated souls and so in the commenter to this true probably speaks of Russia and he says the Russ's were originally exchanged between the Spiritual Living being and the spiritual whole the Supreme personality of godhead
 the spiritual exchange or russet is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord
 the Supreme for sound you got it is therefore described
shooting mattress in a very ancient texts like to punish ads in the VIN Vegas Nevada campus as The Fountainhead of all Russ's right actually that's in upanishads it's a Butters and Russell Russell by sound I think it is it is it found at a ball dresses
 when one Associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges ones constitutional wrestle with the Lord than a living being is actually happy
 and this is all going later with Miles Davis said right cuz this is a talk about the true self it's underneath it all right when you get to that true self you can exchange Russell you can exchange love in a variety of of ways
 is Eagles on the D shooting matches indicate that every living being every one of us has its constitutional position it's true self it's frupa which is endowed with a particular type of Russia a particular flavor particular type of
to be exchanged with the personality of godhead in the Liberator condition only this primary Russa is experienced in full
 in the material existence the Russell is experiencing Spirits in a perverted form write a warped form which is temporary and these and that's the rest of the material world are exhibited in the material form of Road your anger and so on so he we have a self
 and in that when we were store to to the true self Underneath It All underneath the mind and all its programming and it's also ideas of ego for false ego and all of our concerns and there is that material desires material resentments and all that underneath is the true self
 and that true self just plays with a supreme self in an exchange is Russia flavors of love
but for some reason we become confused we're trying to taste russet outside of that relationship and we're tasting it in a warped form
 but like Miles Davis saying you know if you keep playing
 on the road along the right path you can eventually play like yourself and end up the path of bhakti is kind of like it's kind of like laying out the just like a musician all have different scales that they practice and so on you know like here's the scale the worshipping of the DD right that the aspects of the ritual of archana Audi dealership like it's a meditation in which you play a role
 and you play that role in the beginning you play it in a sense mechanically
 right here you follow the rules and you follow the regulations you do it as you've been taught
 but if you do it with with your mind in the right place
you reach a point where you're no longer just following rules but you're playing for yourself you know it's like it's your own true emotions that are arising and we might have to play a long time until we're able to play like herself but if we read the more than we understand it the more they were focused on it
 the more it becomes you know if active sure I think it's safe to say that the process of self-realization about magana is a chance to find yourself underneath the ego-self that we've been living through and playing out and pretending it if we see someone who is like immersed in ego
 it's awkward it it's totally awkward it's it's it's repulsive almost and then when we sees people who are very authentic and very grounded and very sincere it's something that touches our heart and it is the spiritual
is always walking this line of like can I like move ahead but not be overwhelmed by eagle from me moving ahead and when you find a bodhi's I think what if one of the most attractive thing about people in spiritual path for me is meeting people didn't seem like they were motivated by ego or everybody else was trying to sort of like it impressed me with something or sell me their thing or sell me themselves with somebody there what whatever in and it when you see somebody acting from an authentic place it's quite attractive and so the idea of you get to finally be yourself is an attractive thing and then and consumer culture has all different ways of selling us are authentic self we're going to sell you this is what you this is what you're like here in athletic person or you're a you're a Down to Earth person that you're a sporty person or you're at whatever else crazy off-the-wall
freaky person but they're actually is often times that is just also another projection of the ego-self and I can honestly say that I feel like I feel like I'm becoming more authentic in this process and in that process you not only relate to God in a more authentic way because you can't approach god with the girl he wanted to know if you can't get closer is a barrier there's like an invisible force field to get to God God will shatter that ego and it's not like it's because the ego is not solid it's it's very delicate and it will break away because we're not of this world or Spiritual Beings so but I'd only do we really light with God a more authentic way
 we were late with humans in another and in a special way as well and we we can view that by relating to people or have been on this path for very long time and it inspire
it could be for me maybe one of the most
 most motivating factors on my spiritual path is to meet people who have been on this paper one long time and see how they're moving in this world without ego and and and and genuine like a vulnerability at heart and it's quite attractive also speaks to that in this commentary says it says therefore one who changed full knowledge of these different Russ's when you really study this science about the as it's laid out involve time as it's as its detailed in in books that draw from the bottom of time or explain about time like the nectar devotion about the rest of me to send you
 did it. The more that you study at the more tests reveal to you that's even practical in this world he says therefore one who attains full knowledge of these different addresses
which are the basic principles of activities are all motivated in a certain way
 one who does it can understand the false representations of the original Russ's which are reflected in the material world the Learned scholar seeks to relish the real Russ's
 in the spiritual form I want to boil it all down and get to the real thing and what year describing is things yet to come with your authenticity let it's almost like going to Airbnb in looking up over house and they call they've got a hot tub it's right near the downtown City Center oh look what else is there's always photos to try to attract you in lower you in we get it we get let you go cripples us breaks us Eagle doesn't give us what we want it which is a big blue able to get to the first place most people are not at that level tell me what I'm trying to think how can
that look better look sharp we're live in our Eagle thinking of ways to actually blow up re go to impress the world and once you get to the point where you like I'm over that game then what you're describing is like a secret you know it is secret a trapdoor that you never knew was like under the rug and it's like a whole another chamber of not only can you be authentic but you have these very very interesting relationships not always interesting nuanced relationships with God it's almost like a trailer before a movie or a hey this is just a taste of what is yet to come. I don't understand it but I can understand the basics of like okay Michelle. Are you going to let off that way or going to stop playing that role so you know where in that costume yeah it's it's some why are these
Ellis there in Baba time why are we hearing about these past times why is it so
 so much focus on it
 you know why is it the culmination of all the teachings of yoga
 and this is I'm a read another quote this is from g m schwag also known as Goldust Professor write his book Dancing Vine love which is a really brilliant explanation of the Russell Leela Krishna which is considered the essence of all the Lila's Christmas dance dance with the gopis know so he writes the special nature of Lila
 is both playful and didactic alright it's both there to enjoy as well as to teach he says all know Lila is for the pleasure of Krishna and his devotees
 and everything
Curtis and Lila contributes to the delight and celebration of supreme love and beauty
 there are aspects that also instruct those who have yet to enter into it as of tarek to me so we're saying that through practice one can enter into that esoteric domain and actually be themselves and in exchange Russa and experience all that we're searching for in relationships and through things here you would find in this Divine connection and he said that the Lila is why does Krishna perform his duties performed in for his own pleasure and in to give pleasure to those that he loves but they're placed involve time for all of us to read because they're all so didactic that they're also teach and they teach lessons on a on a practical level what does it mean it means that teaches I'm just going to not want to sound dumb here and so so
they're teaching and they're teaching again that they do teach practical knowledge but also their teaching us to understand what it means what it what how one enters into that esoteric domain how one finds the true self for instance in this Lila with Lord machine gave a lot more shrink has appeared
 it was there been ghastly aspects to this Lila there's been you know wonder and in his form and it's so on to anger and a transcendental anger has been displayed in a lodge you know sweet served in a mood of servitude towards towards initiative towards what is going to come out and at the end
 distance mood is going to change our native once once he is killed or implied that part of the then he's got nothing but softness right the Paw
foot for for a quad and then he's going to say I want it out of love
 I want to give you something right I'm capable of giving you anything tell me what you want you know you're in love in his heart for his devotees just pouring out and he has a genuine desire this is what he wants to taste the Russel Wright she wants to have that feeling of I love you so much walking I give you
 and ends and here's the part of the didactic part of it is that a lot of say I don't want anything from you my love for you is not some kind of business I didn't I don't do what I do for you to get something from you I do it out of love we have so we're so clueless about love or we take part in and that's the essence like why what is it that warps this Lila in this world
how is what is it that pure about
 Lila play in the spiritual realm and what is it that warps it in the material realm in the element that wore to the selfishness right that that rather than thinking of the other we think about ourselves first and that warps the whole play so we're kind of playing out these love affairs and its home but to to the degree that their selflessness to that degree they resemble the dalila's of the spiritual into the grid that their selfishness to that degree their warped that's why we hear the closest thing to loving God is the Mother's Love for a child you need a birth aw so so can't we understand what lust is and sometimes you say all I love her and we think that that's the most bass things you could say that's the most bass interpretation of the word love this so many bike variant degrees of love maybe maybe the lowest you could think of some really low versions how to use that word and then very refined
so imagine the mother's you are loved for the child's for the innocent vulnerable child
 imagine going deeper and deeper into that just gets more and more refined yeah yeah yeah and so they're they're didactic in the sense that they teach us he's less but also their objects of meditation right it's like this is also the what the sages would matter they wouldn't they meditate on the Bucky Yogi's they meditate on namah Krishna same qualities Lila Christmas Past Times and Rupa Christmas court so the Lila especially you know becomes a focus meant to be read them with meditate on them we absorbed them into the wood let the Mind become absorbed in them and in this action becomes the process of purifying Minds you know if it's crazy it's an ablation done Lila we're practicing the fall in love out of the
for real I Fall In Love out of this world with nothing of this world and then you could turn it back and and actually love everything in this world from the proper perspective yes yeah real reality I love you cuz I want this from you or not capable of being in this world it's it's a it's a warped reflection of the outside of this world interesting concept I will subscribe to your newsletter
 yes okay so let us continue this Lila
 lot more right before starting the srimad bhagwat time witches are very mean to Conquest what should I bring specula Basin receives to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reissue the super most human being
mother Saraswati the goddess of learning and then she'll be off today of the author not stopped right age for bothering you soon it's a sticky a regular tennis classes in the Bog, and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable and irrevocable fact only on October on this year I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet

 because of his roaring all the elephants in the world begin to cry and fear
 these are you think these are
 analogies and metaphors exaggerations why don't you think the African elephants were crying to everything
 you know
 that's one thing we really got to get to the answer that right because we hear that you know that run across the pool is taking over into the palace and you know it up in the higher planets but then we also there all day
Stomps you know in India where they say that it said this is what I told her she needed to that you could have came in different times and different places to
 yeah but we should really look into that. Oh yeah airplanes were thrown into outer space and their War airplanes then people just FYI the whole commentary on it that actually they were far more advanced in this time they know this thousands and thousands of years ago these noisy horrible you know tubes they didn't need air traffic controllers okay bring them in they just they got it make a new one to land
 airplanes were thrown into always fights on planes now or do we just not have cameras on our phones where they're always fights on plans it seems like every day there's another fun on a plane this girl
 what do you follow that you see I have never why I never once seen a fight
airplane you haven't seen that am I alone in this there's all your watching videos fine but I'm saying it's not like it's happening all the time
 Pokemon happening all the time on my YouTube thread
 I've never seen a plane and it seems like they're having everyday now or maybe just people didn't have change your algorithm brother
 alright airplanes retarded outer space and a planetary system for the hair Lourdes read his head because of the pressure of the Lord's low to speed the Earth appear to slip from its position and all the hills in the mountains sprang up
 do you do it's his intolerable Force because of the Lord's bodily of halogens both the sky and all directions diminished in their natural illumination that makes sense
show me a photo of God incarnated it right in front of you he's pure fulgence
 it must be like blinding
 yeah well there's that prayer and you should punish a dry please remove your glitter nail polish and so I can see your personal feature see your face like if God was here right now maybe two blinding right
 manifesting a bulges
 I dream of that the only way to save it but I had a dream of being in front of a blind lining opponents are you sleeping in one of those tanning things fell asleep in the tanning booth it was it was actually a blinding of false and I was like I cannot see a thing
 okay I'm going to write that down I'm going to start recording my dreams and I'm having some good dreams lately it's an interesting practice you'll get your rude had me kind of happened. My dream
as soon as you wake up at the riot act remapping yeah but yeah I'll write it down as soon as you wake up okay being very angry and finding no contestant to face his power and opulence then sat down in the Assembly Hall on the excellent throwing of the king because of fear and obedience no one would come forward to serve the Lord directly when he already killed her and now he's just sitting down but the anger you know has yet to fully receive right to it all the date we're going to hear all the tables are sitting there like you just can't approach him
 Veronica Shapiro had been exactly like a fever of meningitis
 in the head of the three worlds Gus when the wives of the demigods and heavily planets
that the great demon have been killed by the personal hands of the screen person out of godhead their faces blossomed in Great Joy Majid seen that face just the wives of the demigods again and again showered flowers from the heaven upon Lord to string a name like rain you know what I got I got to find this video for you it's one of these guys guys either an MMA or boxing they're just like showing off and dancing and I know it know it just like a real super cocky like he'll do things to put their hands behind their back and then there's just kicked her in the head is like asses at this is Lorna stringing it and you just hear you just cheer when they everybody loves to see the tire and cocky person go yet
who is dancing he was shuffling it was pretty scared of anybody phone
 and it's over and everybody sort of rejoices and that's sort of the sweetness of the whole thing the wives of the demigods showered flowers
 beautiful scene
 at that time the airplanes of the demigods love to see them I would have been mean the carriers like Lord Brahma Road a swan is that his airplane or does he have another airplane with swivel seat Bruce wahn well there's all kind of gave us I don't know if they all have a personal you know like animal like carrier but they have these flowers are plants you don't like these kind of I know but just their does there you notice their Swan go in their flower are playing with them or is you know I don't think you should. You don't need a flower airplane
 you think it's like a cruise what are they call those like
on those big ships that have airplanes on it what is it called again aircraft repair on your actions little mouse the demigods began beating drums kettledrums they always have these drums to take if we can have drums they can to I know but I don't carry a dream with me all the time they're always busting out of drum maybe they bring them to the event and I think so I think they bring it to the event drums and them be Angelic women began to dance and we seen Indian dancing is very beautiful classical Dance Imagine these demigoddesses doing it while the Chiefs are there is the planet of the singers who sang very sweetly I would love to I've heard some good singers in my time I can imagine how he's going Darvis Mustang
again in our warp world of drama we really like in our films they always have music to company no to try to create to to hide or the experience sure it does speaking right now
 you know what I mean ever do that you hit listen to a clip that there's music behind it and whoever is doing it wants you to start to think like a certain way if it went to do to do to do do do then whatever I'm say I'm really stupid another music behind it that is going to sound really more profound so when the event that everybody had been waiting for so long the Tyrant was finally dealt with and hopefully the day of his aren't just thinking of their own thing but they're all sitting like
is it that that everybody's happiness is just sprung forth and effortlessly spontaneously did the universe's greatest musicians and Dancers just broke into song and dance and it hide in the whole experience can you imagine what that music my sound like can you imagine even today I say I got the music Sorry to sound like an old guy but the music today to go to the top 10 like for the top 10 now you go to like Spotify like what are the top 10 songs right now I can't even tell you I just if we analyze what is musically in my opinion objectively it's like primitive and almost like thoughtless how so much of his put together and
did I say even if you do come back to the seventies in the sixties we had so many great creative musicians and you know the music was very popular but imagine what this music was like we can't imagine you will see a towns that are so like slow and building and extract goes on forever in your service sitting there and sort of churning and then you hit this next level that part two and almost certain people just spontaneously to get up the governor after sitting meditate meditative position where they just like jumping in a toy that is what's going on here okay by the way we have mod of a coming up but the Thursday before
 I haven't even announced it yet except to our local community the Thursday before rathyatra we're going to have a cure time with Monica
 I'm a but you know right now so I may be in town at that time it's possible
 Linda
you should come to Zumiez to come okay going on I left that secret out but I'm about to announce it
 save the dates pay save-the-date Lord around my dear King YouTube Shakira my dear can you to steer the demigods then approach the Lord their head about Lord Mormont King in July Lord Shiva so these are the big demigods a list right this is the A-list demigods and included great saintly persons and the residents of pitre Loca that's like a planet forefathers said hello Kerr the planet of perfected beings in video Dora has the biggest dinosaur snake people
interesting, learning and the planet of the snakes so some of you guys have you do been on in the conspiracy theories and things up like a snake-like reptilian people ever hear people talk like that
 it's in the planets of snakes and they're not just like a garter snake or a Sidewinder diesel people eat snakes imagine it's not like a chimpanzee monkey if you work in the door rug. Then like the first of the residence of patrilocal old the great forefathers they like that a Star Wars bar scene and then the Citadel cuz all of my God these incredible Yogi's with Mystic powers ever I think I did the residents of Frigidaire Loca these Gravely learn its stages of a ride please welcome the snake people show
what is one thing that we like to keep this philosophical and sophisticated but then it drops right back into snake people it makes you sort of it have to expand your intelligence I mean you know there's some people are just really into and things like that like that you know that your mind and these two worlds you know it is interesting because like if you listen you know in the past we've been recommending these lectures if you Google on YouTube radhika Ramon snake people kayak what is it in Silicon Valley isv3 he's he's got different series of courses said he's taught there and one of them is the boys in the human body with time
 and you listened to your right. Yeah it's so in that
you know like the first the first lesson which goes on for a couple hours is he's describing how unique the bog with time is like another one it's not just that it's we say this is great text amongst you know is it's the front sensors 18 piranhas piranhas as one of the piranhas in a completely different category even even if it's not even a question of Faith but just like practically like the sophistication of the Sanskrit use into this like Way Beyond the level of intricacy and in the meters that are used the spot was death of the of the poetic ornaments in that you know the poem The poetic qualities of it are in a completely different level than the way that the philosophical arguments are developed he sang the other ones are kind of like a collection of lore they feel more like that you know like like folk stories and when you get to the bottom of time you get to what even
you Scholars who aren't part of this tradition they say is like some called the greatest poetry ball time you know that it's just on the super high artistic level and so you know it's an artistic level that in order to describe Christmas Lila you eat you know you need something worthy of it you know so and so it's describing Christmas Lila in this very beautiful sophisticated poetry is describing all these great sages and it's also describing the snake people his credibility to to the idea that these ancient books
 today we're following them these Angel books to they were home and people that well yeah but the bar is set so high it's like what are you doing man out of me following just accepting them know we want you to change everything that you do everything
you do have to be completely sure you want to change the quality of it when I wake up early meditate change your diet you know change your concept of recreation and ginger clothes sometimes change what you think it's possible for reptiles reptiles into your life there people there can be people to look at who else is coming to the party here I don't know
 someone can work the Cantina is that attitude I don't know well they just put him on his manager the the lawmakers of mankind of the original mankind when we get the word man from him on a
this I think was in the day of her ma which is you know Harper Center saying how long does there's fourteen months I believe 14 different what do they call it like administration's you know how did they all come at once you say I didn't know they were all together I thought they would I thought it was a post and one monitor at a time but yeah it is supposed so I don't know exactly what is the mono's approached like maybe maybe it's just like different present like an event you make it four different presents like that the current president in like three ex-presidents or some like that Jefferson Washington Lincoln Adams they'll show up to just greet you well they're all dead maybe maybe like Obama places tip
 Tomatoes approached and so did the Chiefs of various other planets is interesting to think that there's a chief of the
planet we do it is we think it's like a well there's Mother Earth I understand and I understand there's a cheap but I'm just saying we don't wreck no world leader is recognizing the chief of this planet they all think they're the chiefs of his plane Emoji does Modi does I think he does
 who else came don't let our political leanings be revealed the monitors approach and so did the Chiefs of various other planets the Angelic dancers approached as did the gandharvas the charnas the yaksha's the inhabitants of canara Loca are they kind of bird like is that right if an rsr the birdie bird people you thought the reptile people are weird some people are after I said reptile snake people you guys are like unfollow about bird
reptile people but you don't match any of it every chance give it a chance at some point if you if anything if there's God right and then everybody's coming to is when everyone comes to like connect with him a glorified is going to be the best music is going to be the most profound prayers is going to be the most far-out scene and isn't more far-out if snake people and bird people arrived we haven't seen a lot in this world we live in a little bit almost like living under it under your bed and try to understand what a wolf is what a peacock is axle is
 right right you can't live on the we live in a tiny little tiny little place in this universe okay so the bird people came who else
try to rationalize bird people here the Potala smerican you look a bit batalha the cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses and every place is that you're like a zombie or zombie School of some kind of time cuz I was just like it's an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and take takes demonic possession of corpses they make their displeasure known by troubling humans they can drive people mad kill children and cause miscarriages but they also guard Villages back to the Amityville Horror one of those guys got in my Village
