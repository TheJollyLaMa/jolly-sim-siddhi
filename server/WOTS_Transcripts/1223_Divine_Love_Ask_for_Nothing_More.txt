 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Brooklyn New York this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your host rocket off and Colson senior educator the Barclays Center in New York have a stupid ass welcome to show everybody still in Brooklyn hanging out with the family nice family day with my kids and my nephews and my brother
 it's weird and I grew up with my brother so intimately my younger brother and then it's amazing how time can just shift like that and then a moment stop.
with everybody I just like one of my own way and had a
 it's not my brother's a nice guy nice family going to read know him again that really
 yeah I think just for who I my karma just had to sort of like Words my own way and that's what that's why I
 I think this philosophy helps me too because
 you know we try to control our children and we are trying we are definitely
 maybe being controlled by parents or kids who just want to need to find herself we understand that like sometimes things break apart like
 quickly sharply
 and this is sort of like how it's your world works
you're about to go somewhere I don't know where I went with it but I don't know where I was going I'm just wondering I'm in a lot of pain today cuz I slept wrong and my whole back pain upper body ya back pain neck pain weird pain that's where I'm at today so we stayed another night and I'm going to drive back Upstate today it won't back up I didn't know you're going back up to get Mara and hang with Mara Mara come down and meet you now
 I don't leave until like the 31st
 Mariner Finance Miss today at 1 and 9:30 p.m. eastern time I see marriage looking all like she's chipper and ready to go yeah she's sleeping fine up there are you kidding
empty house I was like are you lonely she's like no I bet I bet it's like crazy in that big house all alone she's like okay it's going to be a peaceful
 she doesn't know where I stash weapons I hook up weapons hidden around the house I always think it
 you know what it is like I don't know I didn't know if it's me or if all men think like there's a man thing like I keep weapons and I know where they are they sure like cuz I have turbo scenarios going through my head at all times like what a person broke in through this door what would I grab a person came in the back door what would I grab so I just like to place things randomly slightly hit it so if you were to come over my house and see like a pipe under the couch you would just think something there's some pipe for
prison under the couch but I know exactly where the dumb save this it sounds crazy but I know I would love to hear the message board if anybody out there hides various a blunt instruments around their home now he's encouraging others to take the squirrel for that has been marked X Kronos I just curious if you were thinking like me for Charles Wilson says None
 Aaron has a golf club a hatchet next respect Jimmy James thank you Jimmy James validating me
 okay let's get this going recognize up there today
are you going to snap out of it this morning right now we got a show to do man
 yeah okay cuz you're not here okay this is from home
 is Victor Hugo he wrote the lame is do you want to tell you I sure sure tell me about tell me about it sometimes nicknamed the ocean man
 really you never heard that sometimes he was a French romantic writer and politician during a literary career that spanned more than 60 years he wrote in a variety of genres and forms he's considered one of the greatest writers of all time his two most famous works were lame is and
 yeah I know this
 someone put it on
Ford
 I was playing that game I was a sad story to he was at the Forefront of the Romantic literary movement and he did a lot of he produce some more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime this guy did it all and he campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment in slavery
 just give me the state funeral
 at the end of Pantheon of Paris which was attended by over two million people the largest college history that sounds like an excuse to million people that I have been over the course of a week or something like that you know right but still just two million people showing up for a funeral pretty impressive I'll be lucky if I make about that like who's going to my funeral
like a people got to get out of my way by there or is it just going to be like Loki that is really something though in 1885
 you know before they had to know lots of easy cars to get around
 it's not like they didn't have newspapers or maybe
 that newspapers Town criers how did things go viral back then they did things were viral
 okay so let's hear what I have to say when the Nugget okay here's what he had to say to love or to have loved that is enough
 ask nothing further there is no other Pearl to be found in the dark folds of life
 thoughts really nice thoughts
 well I'm trying to figure
if he's talking to me
 whether he would have a love of this world goes to the love the love of this world or the love this either way I think there's something here for us
 when are you when are you coming down this first year in the year of the real romantic
 I like I like the way you phrase is it
 I like the way that he says even just this phrase three word phrase ask nothing further if there's something so
 hours for another four
 B healthy in there you know just be able to say you know what I'm not meant to ask unlimitedly like find out what the essence of life is
 Kian on that and ask nothing further be satisfied with what's most important what's most essential right so he's and he
you know I don't know about his visit the spiritual end of his life or anything like that let's assume he's talking about like the love of this world right sure still it's somewhat evolve to say
 what this is all about
 and there's no other Pearl to be found hidden need to stop searching and understand that really our purpose here has to do with love right field sharing it experiencing it giving it that's that's you know even if someone could just kind of with a kind of a clear sobriety say this is what life is about don't worry about digging and everything else pretty much ask nothing further to me indicates that he's on to something but I think if you want to apply this to to the way that we see things right where we have a hoe
 here we've been saying you know this world is our University okay so this is the University of what
in one sense we're saying everything you going to say the University of Love is over you going to say no I was going to say that okay double the length of the word going love
 where is they say that this is like a like a university so what is it how do we graduate it really means that we're just kind of letting go of everything else
 but nor or less a purifying ourselves of everything that hinders pure capital L spiritual love with might want me to do the attachments that I have the misconception that I have.
the unfavorable sentiments that I have I need to let them all go why why do I let them all go for the purpose of divine love to experience really what I'm made to experience so you know which is and I'm searching for it in the love of this world you know like Victor Hugo is getting it like the other have this is what everybody this is really ends up being the most important thing but when is informed by Bob and Tom
 you know who I'm on that when this Victor Hugo understanding is informed nourished you know empowered permeated by by the inside of the box and then it becomes so much even more meaningful Divine Love Is All We need ask nothing further don't ask for the things of this world don't even ask for Liberation from the sufferings of this world is the sufferings of this world are going to help qualify me for Pure Love For Your Divine love
and I accept them ask for nothing further but I like to get there was quite a bit of money but what you got there today one of those days you like I've got nothing I got nothing to offer anybody but but it's one of those things like I said take any love song in the material world and turned it towards Krishna so this is sort of sounds like he's talking about love of this world but you can turn this towards God for sure to have to love or to have loved that is in somis like
 if you have felt some like deep Taste of spiritual life and even if it goes away you have that remembrance you know I know we
 Minister I guess you can call us ministering to lot of brand new people who are brand new to bhakti but in time and it wasn't until
find out that there's people who been you know who been practicing body longer than we have that tune in to the show and they find like this the podcast gives them a lift and maybe they're not in keeping this highest standard that they were at one time but they finding some type of juice here to all of you I tip my hat and we're here for you too and we're all sort of we're all sort of like struggling to maybe get ourselves back to some higher caliber of perhaps where we once were or we have that love that's what I was thinking when I read this when I felt like that a time where everything was like you were right on track with your spiritual life maybe maybe people can find shelter in in
 in in this verse thinking yeah I've loved that that I actually had that taste and we come on the podcast a lifted higher again
 let me know
and I do this with reservation I asked you this question with reservations but you know I'll just blurt out everything I'm going through right now so that we can talk no no no water balloon right now on the podcast go ahead
 it's other things that you may play that Les Miz is there anything there that that, are you freaking kidding me I don't know anything about it that coincides with this with his love is everything and did that there's no other previous track you know I just saw a saw good movie last night I fell asleep in the material world it's just
 it's sad it's just like I said we're going to hit some verses today that it's just sad and lame is
one of those stories where this you know this young lady meets like this dashing man and they and they have a loving you know the summer of love and she gets pregnant he disappears so she's raising This Little Child all alone she's had some dream that he'll come back except miserable it's it's late is Butera world is Les Miz and hopefully you can keep that bubble of Illusion going for a while until it gets really miss you know
 okay well then you're going to I think you're going to go get me like a miserable really don't know where we're heading right for the diving right into that while the couple versus down it's too actually even immediately we're diving right into let's go let's go
 perhaps you're in this in this there is a spiritual love we're all reaching for here
 this hot
the rain and the musketeer saraswathi India something before deciding to shoot my baggage, starboard means of Conquest when should I be respectful of businesses to the Supreme Lord Narayan and snoring to rain reach you this your most even being with her mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and disability office today of the author messed up her usual botheration H&M bug about Save-A-Lot bag of it to you too much locate back to your bubble tea nice sticky but regular tenants and classes in the bottom of Tom and by rendering service to the pier to Goldie's all that is troublesome the car become erratic hated
 and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transcendental songs will be established as a revocable fact
 home again of timid and Elsia and Anja Nashua, I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open
Portside of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their load of speed
 reading for the Chanel bag of time
 Canto 6 chapter 16 text 5859 I believe 59
 bring me a higher love what a poignant song
 set alarm we are still hearing from Lord Vishnu just speaking truth to chitra K2
 Mongolian remembering the great trouble found in the field of activities
 performed for fruitive results
 remembering the great trouble found in the field of activities performed her fruitive results okay and remembering how one receives the reverse of the results one's desires
this is that's a very interesting way to phrase that yeah because it it doesn't actually mean you work hard you make some money it means you were actually hard for pleasure
 to make money do you make money but it doesn't mean so you might get the money but you don't necessarily get all the pleasure that goes with it sometimes sometimes money really complicate your life could feasibly ruin your life I can set you up to be robbed or cheated or
 strong attachments
 any weather from Material actions or from fruitive activities right now I just started again because when you start remembering the great trouble found in the field of activities performed for primitive results and remembering how one receives the reverse of the results one desires weather for material actions or from the fruit of activities recommended in bated literature's
 an intelligent person should cease from the desire for fruit of actions or by such Endeavors one cannot achieve
the ultimate goal of life
 on the other hand if one acts without desires for fruit of results in other words if one engages in bhakti devotional activities he can achieve the highest goal of life with freedom from miserable conditions considering this one should cease or material desires that's like the bottle to get it right there
 but I'm working this way detach from the fruits without these expectations
 yeah just just interesting this idea if we were to be real thoughtful sometimes thoughtful and honest and sometimes it's even
 difficult to be honest with ourselves but to say you know how many times have I strive for something I had a goal in mind I had a picture in my mind is right I'm going to keep this in Wenatchee this I'm going to be happy
and then we achieve it and then we find that that little Paradise that I saw at the other end of the rainbow and nap her
 materialized the way that I had always envisioned it as a matter fact even what I thought would bring me pleasure from me pain so is Lord Vishnu at Divine being behind everything just saying just open your eyes think about this right this is this is the way the material world works even if
 even if I'd called very good karma even if
 things in this lifetime go relatively smoothly
 you know you can picture like many people in the world are just like it never manifest into what I hoped it would be and it was like a lot of heartbreak you know some people like it was straight out tragedy and then there might be some
do you know do you know where I live to the end and it was a good life and it was a happy life and I'm ready to let go now
 that it just even that
 requires some level of wisdom and attachment to be able to approach death that way you know
 enter really feel that way otherwise even if you like one relatively smoothly for us and it was relatively Pleasant and death is terrifying now it's all going to disappear and I have no idea what's what you know her
 set alarm in any case it's going to be for this to work smoothly is going to require knowledge and attachment and ultimately because that's what y'all meant to send us is going to require devotion now this is going to little deeper here with text 60 or not
 ecstasy as husband and wife
a man and woman plan together to attain happiness and decrease unhappiness working jointly in many ways but because their activities are full of desires these activities are never a source of Happiness interesting and they never diminish to stress on the contrary they're the cause of great unhappiness comes to these Buddhist statements of desires causing pain yes it's the desires and the expectations in the hopes that we've invested in and it's like he's about to get a network of desirous it's like it's not just one that we're trying to expand our desires as you become more successful in the material world your desires oh you got your house I want to expand my house on a build on to my house I would acquire the neighboring properties I want to get a house in another part of the world or another part of the country it it's not like okay now
got to this point this urgent the financial and economic Landmark now it's like I want to expand that it doesn't stop where does it say when you meet people who actually have the resources but they're just choosing you know what I'm going to live a simpler that's impressive isn't it you know people I know a few people like that and it's it's usually not like that it's usually to the degree they move up they started now going to get a nice server I got to watch now it tells me time now that I got a nicer watch and I'm going to get more of the same shoes more and I'm going to where they do it and now I'm going to get two motorcycles are 38 just expand but they're certain people have that foresight it's not going to make me happy
 my mom might be one of these people now we've heard that our desires drive us to pursue pleasure but we end up getting the opposite results
and this text just got into the romance thing you know man and a woman that they they Envision that Union is going to bring them so much happiness and then it can bring them distress what's one of the Six Flags is giving a reason right it's a cuz again it's like
 for there to be happiness too has to be a certain author Harmony right at me Harmony and if I've got certain desires and you've got certain desires that are different than mine
 you bring us to close together The Clash you know yeah that's why would we always or recommend like we say two people holding hands walking towards Divinity together right now we don't say that don't we we do that's that's our thing that's a shirt man I'm telling you or or but you could also look at it like you know it's like two different little solar systems you know with her desires revolving around them
and then but the two decide let's just connect and let let revolve around the sun you know like if together we decide that we're going to move around
 the center then we can move in harmony but if I'm trying to get you working around my center near trying to get me to work around your Center
 then that Union brings distress well it's one of these things that
 I got to start it yet a couples a couple free marriage counseling business on the side hustle that you got you got to have all these things in a row like what do you guys want out of this marriage there's another things cuz sometimes you get together with a person special in America get together over a romantic or sexual or physical attraction and then he sure liked get down to the nitty-gritty you actually have two different sets of desires two different
next protect people realize that after like dating for two years do you want kids have no desire for kids do you want to raise your kids religious know that's a no-go didn't realize that because well my spouse isn't religious but I am religious and then they have kids and that becomes a whole thing are we going to raise the kids religious or not I do believe in a 2 income family or do you believe I should be a stay-at-home mom or stay-at-home dad and so yes something when they're off point when there's no Centerpoint then it just becomes a plethora of like conflicting desires and it becomes even nastier at least I think this first talk about people or at least on the same page
 but their desires just become like they start to explode and you get more and more and want more and more in that cost are on the same page know if they're on the same page they thought they were on the same page
go to wife in man and woman plan together to attain happiness I got the plans she said they're working together a plan on paper yeah and they try to decrease the unhappiness working jointly in many ways but because our activities are filled with desires these activities are never short some happiness it seems like this is a good family working together with common goals but they just want to expand
 the point is the same even if cuz she was a little off on this one at the point is the same as something had to be there I'm just saying like something's working for success of a business causes more you're overwhelmed with the business but his successful you know or sometimes you're raising kids as part of the family plan in one kid is a troublemaker I mean, you might have had a brother or sister or somebody out there too
are you might been a troublemaker he had everything is going good other ducks in a row of the kids are all getting getting there's one kid who's driving everybody crazy yeah it was Brian who's the who's the chief yeah it is but it is just like that so you've done every seems like you've done everything right all the other kids are grown up great but one kid is in and out a prisoner on drugs and
 my kids went out last night like we had this whole day we went out all day in the city all day all day and then the cousins my daughter my daughter and son and my cousins are like okay we're going to go out it's 9:30 at night where you going to go you know my statement rocking us postulate number seven nothing to no good nothing good happens after 10 do you think we're going to do cuz it's not what you're going to do you're hanging out in the Mota ignorance is what anyting anyway they're old I can't control them this isn't it we're getting somewhere now we're starting to let it out.
let the air out of my balloon did you ever hear about this going to happen to my child the day my child I was going to happen I was gripped with fear and I felt that you had a premonition I did I had a premonition of danger danger there was none I fabricated a premonition in my head
 I want to do that yeah you wouldn't be doing much more dangerous things these guys, I should be dead we have a special little fairy Angel protecting us comparison video 3365 family or something like that app have it on their phone
it doesn't doesn't matter how far would they go so you can trust me to GPS exactly where they're going at what time you want to cell phone yeah you got this app to my part of the deal is part of the package it's like recording health bars at my parents Zone where the New York Philharmonic I reset the Philharmonic why is he coming back with torn pants and a black eye every weekend
 okay at 6162 right now this is because I'm having one should understand that back tivities of persons who are proud of their material experience bring only results contradictory to those such persons conceived while awake sleeping deeply Sleeping Beauties of persons who are proud of their material experience bring only results contradict
sorry to those such persons conceived while awake sleeping and deeply sleeping
 did you understand that this is a run-on sentence, one should understand that the activities of persons were proud of their material experience
 they bring only results that are contradictory to those such persons concede it doesn't need that it makes it sounds like an hour talk about other people or something if they bring results that are contradictory whether it's Wild Ones awake sleeping or in a state of deep sleep is contradictory to what they want no matter what state of awareness there and if you're proud person you're proud of the material experience an issue
 it is an issue further understand
 further understand dinner
what should further understand that the spirit Soul although very difficult for the materials to perceive is above all these conditions and by the strength of one's discrimination discrimination this case means discernment one should give up the desire for Freedom results in the present life and in the next thus becoming experienced in transit at the knowledge once you become my devotee kind of all there in 12 verse yes I just want to read this verse it's just you just read this verse you know long as it's saying that you know how many lifetimes do we have to go through
 before we kind of pick up on some patterns right oh the world looks like it's going to keep delivering you know some kind of paradise like happiness but it always gets turned around somehow or other you know
tomorrow's it falls apart you know the influence of time
 but but he says but that's all right because you can further understand that you the soul
 you're above all these conditions that you have an existence above all you just have to realize it it's right there all the time you know and so so so then get to chermont use your discernment Focus make the best of this opportunity we have in this life let go of desires are fruit of results that you've done at and how many lifetimes before you learn the lesson you learn it now and thus become experienced in transit knowledge and become my devotee reconnect to that Source start to rotate around that it does good energy and rotating around that Source you know he's been around and getting the gravity of of that and your ear feeling good
 now this next this is this is a really nice versus next person versus you try to reach the altar
circle of life was expertly observe the Supreme person the Supreme absolute person and the living entity who are one in one in quality in the relationship as part and whole
 this is the ultimate understanding of Life there is no better truth than this and I do like about this one it sets out different markers like life has a goal most people just floating around like golis rudderless directionless you know sometimes they even have all the resources they have they have the Lamborghini but they don't know where to drive to this is this is this is there is a beginning middle and end of here we're at whatever you're coming into this world is there is a final goal there is a there is a touchdown
 persons who try to reach the ultimate goal of life it's it's amazing how we live in this world we don't even understand that there is Direction
it's just wear like that gets the direction for people is just like to have fun. Maybe not at know not everybody there's all different things you know get whatever you can collect stuff
 but you know what this what this really struck me is we're just discussing just the other day I think it was on the q-and-a that we did on Sunday right it said what are we meant to learn what you do persons who try to reach the ultimate goal of life
 was expertly Observe what what you got to see what is it that we're looking for what is that we were meant to focus on you know what should we be keeping our eyes open for that this should have serve the Supreme out to person and the living entity
 Heather Spirit underneath everything right the spirit within each body there's the universe is a body and it has a spirit right who are one in quality in the relationship is
part and whole I am part of the whole right I'm one part to say again like it was wrong about a solar system you know it it has a sun in the middle
 and then has a plan instead of going to let you know everything has its part in it's all connected if I just know my place if I just understand how I fit how it how I click in this is the ultimate understanding of life is no better truth than this you know other ideas of where you find how you how you become complete our experience your complete and you know that those don't work this is the one that works because it's the truth you know in that that was like if you remember where we went to text 4:35 you know having obtained from from Bhagavad Gita having obtained real Knowledge from self realize purse from a selfie light so you'll never fall again into such illusion for by this knowledge you will see okay what we see
that all living beings are but part of the Supreme Court other words that they're mine or it so it's the same message but this is this is this is the mystery of the universe here right understand that you're part of something much larger that Your vitality your happiness you know your meaning is all in connection with this truth you know in connection with this Divine being this behind everything in through that Divine being your interconnectedness with everything is right there is waiting for a sister just to stop chasing and Chase and chase you know what you're pulling on every string and trying to find out you know where is happiness under this rock is in under that rock sure I'll just try to just try to send out in the commentary to to that text for 35 you want to talk about you don't need to read the hoagie to kind of right here how about in just a few senses like to hear the struggle
 this is the whole teaching of the Gita
 yes the whole tea
Camp Akita
 alarm.com Tire connected right now are we connected I thought I was connected proud well I well I'm the one that brought this up right I already had this sitting ready for the moment if I don't bring this forward there is no moment but we're together there for me toward this end that a living being
 Eternal servitude or we could say it's like loving servitor right now like a lover. That's going to not trigger the servitor award right but any case the whole teaching the gates at Target or the sense that a living being is Christmas Eternal servitor cannot be separated from Krishna
and their sense of being an identity apart from Krishna is called Maya illusion
 the living entities as separate parts and Parcels of the Supreme we're we're we're entirely connected with a supreme but we're separate we we our own individual person with their own free will but always connected right so we can't be separate from Krishna the living entities as separate parts and Parcels of the Supreme have a purpose to fulfill their interesting okay have a forgotten that purpose since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies as men animals demigods Etc
 such bodily differences arise
 from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord when one is engaged in transmittal Services through Krishna consciousness
 one becomes at once live
from the solution Temple yeah
 woke up at 4:35 just a very nicely encapsulated meaning of our existence in this world
 text 63 that we got that was 63 but I'm sorry I got two more versus left for the 64 okay if you accept this conclusion in mind being unattached material joint and hearing to me with great faith and that's becoming proficient and fully aware of knowledge and its practical application in life
 you will achieve the highest Perfection by attaining me nice.
I mean that there's just like your sister's a lot here perfect extraction yeah
 let's go through it if you accept this conclusion what I've just been speaking being on attached to material and Joint okay I've been going on since time immemorial more lifetimes and I can remember seeing pleasure through the senses a connection of Material Science is composed of material energy
 contacting objects made of material energy
 for the purpose of a sensation within the mind which is made of very subtle material energy
 thinking the dad is my path to success happiness fulfillment excetera he sang Let Go of that idea be unattached immaterial enjoyment adhering to me with great face to adhere means sounds almost like getting taped to something right
adhesive let me know and look up here
 adhere to stick fast to a surface or substance to believe in and follow the practices of
 so the wise do not take part in the sources of misery which are due to contact with material census
 interesting why should I take part of the source of the misery with everything that we think they will this is the thing contact to take part in the source is a misery misery is going to be something bad like what what don't we do we don't jump in fire we don't walk on glass
 close the door we don't take part of the source of misery why
and what are they they did this when you come into contact with material senses cuz cuz these so-called Pleasures do you say we don't take party and they come and go and I'm I'm I'm left when you're always concerned about losing your pleasure it puts you in a state of anxiety that can be no peace otherwise do not Delight in them was at 5:28 if he's some fresh air job Bogart much time think I'm wrong for that
 everyone's got to join the slow cooker club the shloka club with nityananda Chandra and intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery which are due to contact with material senses Ocean County such Pleasures have a beginning and an end and saw the wise man does not Delight in
 okay so here's a let go of that idea be a wise person
adhere to me with great face
 and has become one of my men to become become proficient and fully aware of knowledge and its practical application in life it's relatively simple one since it was summed up in that little section that comment to her that we just read but you know I can't understand how the mind works understand how the mind and the body and the senses are composed of material energy and how I'm a spark of spiritual energy become proficient in just this understanding and if and if you reflect on it and look into the world through the through the lens of you be going to say click click click it actually makes a whole lot of sense you know an end the more you reflect on it the more that it becomes natural to see it that way so you become aware you become efficient and with that you you learn his practical application life right with grey fur
unless you're into me with great faith and that's become a proficient and fully aware of knowledge and its practical application like you will achieve the highest Perfection by tainting me okay that would want you to reconnect it to that route
 it in terms of
 relief I want to speak of in terms of bliss you know you begin to experience what you been designed to experience where those the the level of awareness that you're designed to experience you experience it
 64 okay 65
 she should get a bus, continued after the sin strutting chitra K2
 and assuring him of perfection in this way the Supreme personality of godhead who is the Supreme spiritual Master the Supreme saw Shanker Sean disappeared from that place is to get your Kay to look tan
it's just like looking there it appears you're unbelievable
 yeah but you know so so now we've we've really gone on a trip you know we started if we go back whole thing started with you know Indra and All the Troubles that he went through because he disrespected his own group your hospitality he went up and down and it ended up man if he did some really off things gone a few people you shouldn't kill that thing cuz I've been there done they're all right we've all been there
 okay killed a few people he's going to kill one was a prominent alright actually two of them were promised so so then part of manifest as a result of injuries
 poor decisions
is that a demon takes birth born in the family the swords and he's like fearsome and he's born to battle with Indra but in the course of that battle it all that comes out of his mouth and all that he says interest is like shocked like oh my God everything they saying is that this is a deeply realize spiritual devotee of Lord Vishnu he thought he was an enemy of Lord Vishnu I'm wondering if I'm an enemy. You know like this on a regular basis like I might be the demoniac one and in Alton the injured cat has to kill him but he you know Richard Surah dies you know it in a state of deep Christian awareness and so then it when that chapter ends
 Mirage Cricket asked you could it was funny how did that demon become such a great to vote it doesn't seem to make sense
play born in that lineage usually they're just like totally Dead Set against fishing and he was totally into him so let me tell you a story about who richest or was in a previous life he was his kingdom Church of K2 he had everything you wanted but he didn't have his son and one sage and Gary came and was able to perform a ritual wherein he had a son but he said the Suns going to give you happiness and distress and shortly thereafter the son was born and shortly thereafter the son died and he just experienced the deepest pain that he could ever imagine you know the deepest suffering in his in his intense grief a junkie or came back with a sage Narda they gave him clear instructions knowledge about who he is about what the world is about who we all are in and so on and then them two to really bug on one's mind a little boy came back to life
in Spokane complete the attachment you know you're not my father you know which father you talkin about I had millions of fathers so that was that was pretty stunning
 and then then church of K2 you know offers appreciation to the sages on gear and Narda how they've enlightened him in this state Naruto said I'm going to give you a bunch of a chance I want you to Chances you know with complete sincerity and in 7 days you'll see Lord Vishnu and that's exactly what happened
 and now Lord vishnu's appeared he offered prayers to Vishnu Vishnu Sheridan Port instructions with him and now chicken cages like on a whole new level of awareness next chapter the level that he was on will be displayed because he's going to get put into a very difficult circumstance circumstance were in a lot of people would be kind of sad a lot of people come ditter lot of people become angry
and we begin to see exactly where he's at coming tomorrow
 yeah that's okay
 key and the essence of life and ask nothing further
 what was the first part of that Yaki into the essence of life as for nothing further
 except the sufferings that lead to Divine love
 bring them on hard to say that we realize people say that
 our network of ever-expanding desires cause distress
 a network of ever-expanding weapons hidden amongst the house I'm on the house cause distress to Intruders for Spiritual love
yeah with the pinky two people holding pinkies walking towards Divinity harmonized around the tree Center
 that's the way
 that should be like the mudra that was going to say just moved here just like and that way like if you send me somebody on a temple you're not sure I did he know them from the podcast just go put up your pinky and just wiggle it and they'll be like at McLaren connect with your pancake caviar logo we could all go
 understand the ultimate goal
 simple understand our identity apart from Krishna is Maya adhere to Vishnu not Material enjoyment
 and this material world is lame as
