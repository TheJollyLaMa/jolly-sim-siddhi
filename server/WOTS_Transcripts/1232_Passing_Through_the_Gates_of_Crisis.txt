 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from the Golden Eagle Village in beautiful Maharashtra this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your house dropping off and co-host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York house stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome to what day is it Friday Friday Friday srimad bhagavatam study
 took the day off yesterday was my birthday kaszuba I know it's my birthday we got home for a big little birthday party that was very nice happy
 I was really how to celebrate it to your satisfaction
broadcast mommy was shoveling out the mercy yesterday but I had a really Krishna conscious experience that it's unbelievable how to cut up a such a steep spiritual to the hospital cuz I saw people in great pain and show somebody dying and I was looking down in my own body and maybe I'll bring above my body and my subtle body and and all the pain maybe wanted to get more spiritual
 it is that Vice not good old-fashioned of hospitality this is about to go downtown Hospital yeah and they are literally collectively smashing down all barriers between religion race tribe and getting right to the essence of what we Are Spiritual Beings they make everybody feel welcome to hospital where I walk in the door and they put a flower Garland around me and then it's because you're okay they don't flower Garland everybody but the flower garden to me
and I was already in tons of anxiety just because of him go to hospital getting checked out and find what's not taken properly and and yeah it is their mood of service is just unparalleled we got fed twice
 and it made me a birthday cake and a hospital is ridiculous a boardroom like like a board meeting and was like a 10 doctor sitting there me and Mara and like a plate up Rashad so like here they are collectively with about a hundred years of education and hear myself who can't like you know barely made it through high school and it just feel it's like just their mood of love and devotion and service is just a like embarrassing edits and it's wonderful and it's inspiring and you see you know what would it be like these guys
I want to be like them what they've done is it created like almost like a model that you could scale to massive proportions of of real health care that makes you feel loved and Addie's when you're going to a place where you lot of people have fears and doubts and let everybody know who's actually been there they said it was such a special experience and know that putting our friend came and broke her leg once a Grand Coulee Dam pilgrimage and she she came early to bring her service she slipped and broke her leg and we brought a right to the hot rod brought us what you said let's go to the hospital right now and at the end of the pilgrimage her statement was the most we were talking about our spiritual experience is always the best part of the pilgrimage for you and she said going to that hospital was the best part
 right and then I remember
 I'm good we're here was alive alive group with the Titans
the title The Titans at the book club and they're here from all over the world are all over the world are there if I understand correctly it's a group of entrepreneurs have a certain kind of spiritual metaphysical kind of Interest sure they met I think they met at a certain kind of spiritual entrepreneurial spiritual kind of conference and they wanted to stay in touch and then they created this regular Gathering they meet online and then every once in awhile they come in they meet in person so the Titans who I spoke with with the titans this morning and some of them are here with us last night's welcome Titans
 are we allowed to talk about you as a secret society is a secret society and if it is
 okay if you had if you create your own you wouldn't be able to keep a secret
all right Miss Mara is here with us today and I humbly walking me through the hospital through all the different tests I had to take I think why did Mary have hers it's test as well
 eat that all your help raise your crazy
 I did get to send another yeah at the hospital though how many years have you been to at your hospital is back in the States and I don't got a lady was bringing me to all the appointment was saying first pulmonary then Pooja and I was like infusion infusion understand she's like and they walked us into another room and there's a full-blown fire sacrifice going on with brahmins all the doctors circumambulating the fire put in the ass on the 3rd I was like what is going on here
this doesn't happen at Albany Med. Vincent's and thank you. I appreciate you accompany me on my birthday thank you I appreciate the experience we have out your cover get meetings today there's a non recovery meeting at 12:30 which is a what's a non recovery meeting it's a promise me to shloka class recovery recovery people who is not non-recovery
 that's right now in recovery sounds like they might be yet
tomorrow she'll be at 6 a.m. eastern time
 alright you ready for the Nugget yes or we good we didn't offend you out the door yet okay so it with us every they're very proper Regal ladies here
 we generally before we get into the study of the bog with time we have what we call a nugget which is just some piece of wisdom from anywhere anywhere where does this come from normally don't take from inside sources that we don't take from Bhagavad Gita by we try to take something more broad but this is actually from our friend Simon Simon Honda we had on the show before but this is from his book The Dark Night of the Soul very good book we should we eat when we had them out here we discussed his other book which is called the Dharma
 the book of Dharma but we should have it back on and discuss. Going to get a lot of people talk about this
yeah they they really appreciated loved cuz when you guys to say in Ancient India soul-searching crisis was not concealed or imbued with shame but viewed as an important time of transition deep rite of passage have you ever felt ashamed when you're in a soul-searching crisis
 ashay maybe just sugar like
 maybe like a little embarrassed or made prices to be like a look at in it for soccer is really going through it I guess it again what they deserve it so there's a little bit of that like if I struggle and you like relish annoying
is it crazy that it is such a soul-searching crisis was not concealed or ambulance shame but viewed as an important time of transition a deep rite of passage rite of passage are we still searching or do you think like when we were 22 we were soul-searching I think they're saying that when you go through a crisis you do soul-searching okay where am I what what is my place in the why do you mean like can we go through that again like in 30 or 40 do search India yeah okay I didn't know there was anything that you carry that there's just the term rite of passage to pass from one stage of steps in your realization to the next you might have to pass through a gate which was going to do our soul searching man
 yes I actually agree yes it is it's kind of like there you could
look at the spiritual path is you pass through one gate with your car is so searching maybe crisis that dip that stimulates the soul-searching and then maybe you acclimate yourself to that next stage of Advanced Pain and become somewhat accustomed to it and then to get to the next stage you may need another price of course I'm in a spiritual path but you know all my shifting things that have been happening in my life I have been like it collapses part of the false identity and lightly start searching what what who am I now that one of the kids has moved out of the house or to the kids move the house now who I am now who am I get my new phase of life and whether your email if you're single if your spouse laughter or you get married again or you have a child of your children grow up we're always going into new small I
small like is a big identity is I'm a spiritual being who's surrounded by matter and I'm trying to reconnect in this world is small identity is my I'm always it's always shifting and so yeah I can see how different chapters of my life I've had to sort of like okay find my footing again about the Reese's or sages means of India called it the Shonda LaShonda which in Sanskrit means despair they understood that periods of Great Tribulation will get difficult to Bear can serve as pivotal moments of growth it sounds like this term the Sanskrit term of a shot at it doesn't carry
 the shame or the embarrassment or whatever it's just like oh yeah that's like that's a human state right that that every human goes through that's becomes very important
and we can look to that
 the growth everywhere look at if we're to look at the history of a person and say where do they make their most spiritual growth we might look straight for that state when did they hit the spare sure and and had to Soul search sure have like all the good stuff is getting poured on us bring up for not looking for some deeper deeper truths were just like so seems like in One sensor or not it's more than validating that state of Crisis is that state of Crisis is a very special man who stands a better chance of a special time in life is a special opportunity is not a shameful thing it's right where the sages knew if if you're not feeling some level despair
 then we may not really be clued and spiritually at all good for feeling to at home in this world then we're probably lost
didn't I always say if a person is going through it they must be sincere they must be sincere cuz I'm Krishna likes yeah gives you whatever you want and it takes it all the way cuz and then there's no other shelter accept Krishna will look at the most important texting about the tradition one bug of agita to shermin box in Bhagavad Gita arjuna's having his his crisis is begins with arjuna's crisis right and a soul-searching and shroom Boggstown exact same thing when I first to die 7 days left to live and let me tell you stories about more crises he's just like yours well there was this elephant another and of course 20 sprayer and County crisis has come again and again and again mysterious child she can't connect with
Bright Smile doesn't like the other children and her husband dies prematurely and she's left to live with the king of Israel like her everything to their house gets burned out in the forest it's a crisis
 even giving birth to the child of the god of the sun at 11 to put that child after child away up for adoption
 but still she says let this happen again and again she pray to Krishna right but these calamities happen again and again I was going to tell her, you know the translation come on in here first in Sanskrit now or say will to Marty deal that's another yeah
what's your tire but does she pray so Queen Conte she's praying to Krishna let these calamities come again and again cuz when these calamities come we remember you more deeply and then you become president of the backup and thank you Tara
 you know I thought this cuz I was speaking with the Titans today oh yeah and they were making you feel like what am I doing one of them brought up the question about that we're talking about the mind a lot and talking about how it's difficult to control the minds and I one needs to reflect on certain truths in order to begin to see the world in a different way but this type of nasty but when we hits these a very difficult State stages are circumstances in life at that point is very hard to reflect on those things that it will actually that's that's the that's the
the moment right there that's when your your your reflection reflection and chews on a regular basis is solid and important in and brings growth but particularly the reflection when there's a reversals in life your Flex on shooting at that exact point is when there's it's magnified the defective that reflection and so therefore the delete the real Yogi's they see these crises Dark Nights of the Soul calamities they they they actually Welcome to My Country Springs and they walk on them because this is the opportunity for a deep spiritual quotes
 broke it to the older run off the 58 year-old I guess
 reflective yesterday ladies o regalo Regal ladies yeah yeah
it's a tough pill to swallow 58 and 98 years old yesterday. I thought you were just going with it except until I tell people I'm okay until someone says so how old are you then it's like what I have to say it that's what I'm choking on it and where the cutoff t-shirt I can pull a few people at 3:40 something about like a little younger anyway okay you ready yeah let's go
 Ryan I must respect the basement East the Supreme Lord Narayan and to Northern Russia the super most
until mother Saraswati the goddess of learning and issue the velocity of the author non-stop radio show me my regular tension by regular tenants of classes The Bob & Tom and Veterinary Service Lapeer devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will be going to a Decatur and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transit at the songs will be established as in a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance and my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet reading from the Shema by what time
 what the doctor say about your eyes have that workout I need glasses can't do 7 to 1 cuz we're all
text when we didn't get to the text yesterday yeah we just read the summary at the beginning of the chapter 11
 pinprick of acquired my dear Brahman the Supreme personality of godhead Vishnu being everyone's well-wisher is equal and extremely dire to everyone how then did he become Marshall like a common man for the sake of Indra and that's kill injured enemies how can a person equal to everyone be partial to some and inimical to others so it appears to him
 that describes partial a vicious playing favorites that he likes Davis he doesn't like the demons occasionally even takes out the demons Kenny really be truly impartial and if he is not impartial isn't that a fault how could you be the absolute Prophet racist in the comments
says Envy in Friendship arise in one who is imperfect I don't think it means friendship in general but in others playing favorites We Fear our enemies because of the material world we're always in need of help
 always something the Lord how I always need help. However does not need anyone's help for he is, so stop by self-satisfied he says in bug of agita Patron put Pump Elementary on your mailbox a priority that are home but deposit them a Shinigami if a Diwali offer is made with love and devotion leave fruit flower or water he shall I will accept it if you'll accept it why does the Lord say this
 he is not actually dependent
 the Lord doesn't need leaves
flowers that need water now he's got all the water he wants okay so he doesn't need he's not dependent
 he is actually he is not actually dependent
 but he also likes to be dependent on his devoted as a nice way to put it he likes to be depending cuz I still feel that he likes to feel they're loving care he likes to feel it's the love that he wants is not the water that he needs is not the flower that he needs yeah but it's the love therefore he says he actually says
 you're my bucket property Tottenham Bucky pirate that he says it twice it's the bhakti is the devotion is to love that he's accepted spin giving the $0.01 the rest of us just a token right it's like let me give you this flower but it's not the flower that him that he wants but it's the love with which the flowers given that is the one thing that we have to give my daughter made that chess set for me
you didn't need to check so I need a chest that you never even used to check it my duty is not at home and would shop in the fact that you put hours into it and cared for in sand it and finished it was a labor of love and then she gave it to you you gave it to me as an offering and you were touched touched okay so that's a nice point he says is he depended on the offering of the devotee he's not actually painted he likes but but he likes to be dependent this is Lila is his loving play this is his Mercy simerly he does not fear the asaurus
 there is no question of partiality in the Supreme percent they got it he's bald as he's not in the eighties independent but he likes to feel like he's dependent on his devotee
it is still or dish in himself the Supreme personality of godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure there for what benefit would he drive I'm siding with the demigods what interest would he fulfill in this way since the Lord is Transcendental why should he fear of the asuras
 how could he behaved how could it be envious of them and buy obvious I think especially means you're hostile hostile towards the Astros are the demons
 x 150 greatly fortunate and learned Brahman whether to Ryan is partial or impartial has become a subject of great down for me kindly to spell my dad out with positive evidence that Narayan is always neutral and equal to everyone
 now okay so he's put forward his question and this question is the kind of question that Sugar Ray goswami
appreciates because it's the topic is right it's not a frivolous topic it's not a used to stop think it's not it's not a topic that has no
 deep meaning to it or has no spiritual me to it is kind of topic that gets him speaking about Krishna never asked run a song about like details of Leela he gets excited about his past times he gets excited and gives you more information than you asked for and then sometimes I'll take that conversation I'll just say something I don't know ask some dumb question I have like here is a man whose
 imbued with transcendental information and I ask something really stupid instead of like responding me
correcting me by saying that's not inappropriate he'll just pretend I never asked a question and just do that famous
 New Look Away in space and then it's like that then you would have changed either and he knows exactly what what it takes to growth grinds look away
 so the question is nice let's hear what's next on Fox 45 the Great Sage to the Swami set my dear King you have put before me an excellent question discourses concerning the activities of the Lord in which the glories of his devotees are also found extremely pleasing to devotees such wonderful topic topics always
cataract the miseries of the materialistic way of life there for great sages like Narda always speak upon the srimad bhagwat tongue because it gives one the facility to hear and chant about the wonderful activities of the Lord let me offer my respects to a basin seas and she will be off today and then begin describing topics concerning the activities of Lord hurry to go right to appreciations first that's that's a lot to learn from this first right then appreciate his group was his father and you know we heard at the very beginning of October I'm at the beginning of the second chapter the first cancer that suit to go so I'm says it's only these kind of questions
 that lead to a super City take to complete satisfaction to self so the question is appreciated the topic is appreciated and so he responds to that way there's this I'm going to be a little something to come to you
proper dress whenever there's an opportunity to hear about the transitional activities of Lord we must take it
 cute animal hospital recommends that one should always engage in Krishna Katha by chanting and talking about Krishna in hearing about him that is the only occupation
 Ava Krishna conscious person and what are your oxidation I told Christian what's your occupation but that's what occupies a time that's a great way to put a surprise my time you know another thing is as soon as you're even with your with the group of devotees but the conversation diverts to something mundane yeah it just doesn't satisfy the self feel like I'm just I just brought the whole conversation down you got to keep it high you got to keep it hot I think when when I hear that in one stage of my practice
I think number come on we can't just talk about this all day I like that's that's kind of like are you being like a little exaggerating you know speaking of speaking a little bit what's the word I'm looking for I like
 nobody does that all day right now but as soon as the years go by
 one might find that actually this is all I really wanted and I can kind of adjust your life in such a way that you actually do find there's an eagerness in me
 on the Titans have to go on to the next program thank you for joining us you know what I find also people I think newer people to bhakti when they come on a retreat like this or a pilgrimage and the conversation is always kept very high in the like wow I've just had a very spiritual experience then they go back to the
life and it becomes blatantly obvious like what have I been talkin about all these years and then get angry at their their friends at home like this is such a stupid conversation we're having it so that's part of like the growing pains & bockius how to incorporate spiritual conversations spiritual friendship spiritual relationships were it's not just like okay I'm just going to kick out all my old friends like when you're playing Scrabble you going to dump your Scrabble pieces and get all new Scrabble pieces you got to figure out you got to figure out that balance of how to add Krishna to your life and then bring in and bring people into that conversation or else you'll
 what happens is
 arouse you start scaring everybody away sometimes could be a good thing I need to scare away some my old friends but I was thinking that
 to a lot to pry most people I think okay I get it
get together for an hour a day you read this book you got some inspiration from that you get on with your life right
 but
 we can do other things all day like it other words people can watch television all day
 even though for the most part is complete garbage Ride Like the binge out on something entirely meaning that's meaningless brings us no peace of mind that brings us no deeper insights into life if we can just binge out and Lucy on that why should we not be able to have an insatiable
 desire to hear these ancient texts which has survived the Millennia on topics and on topics that are meaningful Ann dumb infused with apparently like Limitless daps why would
we feel and if once we got that taze you need some entertainment is that what's going on okay here's the deal at five times for The Bog of time twice read the Bhagavad Gita back and forth read a few of the other piranhas then you're allowed to watch that and you won't want you anymore we're staying in that Airbnb in Mumbai and we I turned on the television and they have Netflix on open up Netflix guide never watch TV so what I'm hearing in the end of click on Netflix and you know it's like my day off before my birthday before I go to the doctor and I think you out you know there's so many Indian TV shows that's better than watching an American TV show it's like one step closer to Chris course mare is in the other room so I'm clicking on it and of course
 it's a Murder movie
people invest so many hours in murderous and now they do just like that it's like television series what do you call those measures aren't I don't know whatever the thing was Breaking Bad like that
 send it. You it just like the fish has taken the bait and now the fishermen just can let you go really in
 they're serious is there a it's all right it's our Tennessee to get hooked we so what are we going to get hooked by that's a great one and it's all you know it's entertainment Let Me Entertain You and viticulture had to figure it out before we figured it out there because you said we are going to beat you there's a great battle going on between good and evil we're going to beat you
there's a great Mystic Yogi who cursed upon do as soon as he has intercourse with his wife he will die and want to hear about that another one when karna left the lap of his teacher he immediately shot two deer who are also mating and they turned out to be too great sages when I'm at story want to hear that one has dresses beers and killed one of them then he got cursed so it's like Bates us and the bait though is luring us towards God it's really nice and towards God all this other bait is reeling Us in towards often times pression depression and I'm saying that that's where TV goes right now everything is murderous everything is dark and if you want to move away from murderous and dark well let's go to something like evil then there's like some
all entities Zombieland right well I got some stats for you here and I have in this for the Nugget it's about television Annex yes and connection to television to lesson plans while I know that there's a growing there is growing evidence that depression is link to television watching a large body of research I mean it's not at all the stuff that we're talking about but it's even like this on a a biological level if you're not out in the sun or certain amount of time every day did the the the chemicals in the body that make one satisfied and happy aren't released so the more that you're staying inside and staring at that screen the last time that you're actually getting the juice that she needs to do
you'll bounce like well there was some type of governor in in place when we were kids when we are watching Welcome Back Kotter like that was a great episode I can't wait for
 there was a waiting. To watch the next episode right then they'll binge it for hours and like binge things could have been changed so yeah and it look at the content when we were growing up what was the craziest cop show out there was like the rookies Adam-12 his head caught in between a couple bars and bring the grease you got the grease has ears that was like the type of
 nowadays it's like Law & Order SUV is just like this the sickest Minds like mine
I think about six TV shows I think it creates more sick people or call me in extreme absolutist urine stream absolute and such things there is no good If I Were King no evil evil people interesting ideas
 I would have never thought about locking people in in basements is human prisoners never think of those things but then they come up with a good idea
 Kathy you have her boat okay they have a Nazi thank you
you ready yes there's growing evidence that depression is link to television watching a large body of research has found that people who watch a lot of Television are more likely to be depressed than those who don't watch is Brian primack of the University of Pittsburgh medical school was the lead author of the new study he says every extra hour of Television get this at every extra every extra hour of Television mented 8% increase in the chances of developing signs of depression so if one person doesn't watch television another person watches one hour television day they got a 8% higher chance of being depressed but what if they watch 5 hours a day which is not at all, oh yeah now you have a 40% higher chance when I was growing up I remember I was like I'm going to try not to watch TV today couldn't do it that's how much we watch TV growing up
continuing Dawn association between screen time and depression on us adults that the study was published by the National Library of Medicine the finding of the study suggests that screen time is a significant risk factor or marker of mental disorders among the adults since mental health is predicted to be a leading cause of disease burden by 20-30 the intervention should be targeted towards the prevention of these kinds of risks risk factors it's a risk factor into the finding the finding from the study could inform individuals and policymakers to reduce
 the time limit of screen time policymakers I mean I guess it's more like me the new king so anyway there you go see there's a blessing of mine
collapsi as soon as we watching TV I fall asleep it within the first four minutes saving
 I don't have insurance
 but that's that's a bit so we hear about someone that's like constantly interested in thinking and talking about Christmas Lila's and we think I'll come up with something that's giving you I'm a super City it's giving you once you get in the groove of and really understand what it is it's giving you life is give me energy to give me wisdom is giving you satisfaction and meanwhile I'll sit there and watch television for 6 hours a day and it's giving us depression you know there's something about the bait of Krishna Consciousness it sort of like
 I don't know maybe with a I wasn't attracted to it it took a little bit to get the liking of it there's a sort of like a bitterness at first that gets extremely sweet where the bait of the material world is quite a
siding and then you're like what have I been doing for the last bag of potato chips and doing it so amazing and this is why I love you so much I'm so in love with this crazy wonderful place it's like I'm sitting giving a class this morning at the yamuna and to all the students and
 I'm watching these Indians do tours
 I knew like you know whatever 25 years old 30 years old giving getting a tour and they're going through all the different pastimes of Krishna and add speakers through the forest and they're all like attentive and the boys are holding hands and it's just like a fun outing I was thinking Americans would never do this they would never do it but they're like happy satisfied these guys probably aren't like the greatest devotees but this is what they're doing as Recreation or a school field trip or something to do
it's a lie and then the guys just the monks just giving a lecture and telling a story and they're all like
 info is beautiful it's really beautiful just a sweet culture
 start getting ready right now
 she knows text 666
 the screen person out of godhead Vishnu is always Transit adult material qualities and therefore he is called near Laguna or without qualities because he has unborn he does not have a mature body to be subjected to attachment and hatred although that Lord is always above material existence through his spiritual potency he appeared and acted like an ordinary human being accepting duties and obligations apparently like and conditions. So
this is the answer to the question is he in partial right off the bat coming out and saying he's not even by his nature it makes no sense even suggest that he's partial because when he's near going to he has no matter is our material conditioning that makes us think one person is our friend one person's inner enemy but he's he's he creates those those modes he's Beyond those he's also a property he transcends the material nature and he's Spa my iguana habesha he enters the material environment by his own energy it's like we and you know we getting old and pushed by energies that are more powerful than us he enters this realm by his own choice by his own energy so he's not struggling in the way it's because we struggle show with fear that was your friend and me we become partially right
he's got he doesn't have those struggles he's beyond the influence of those in those energies that create those kind of struggles so from that very practical perspective it just doesn't add up that he would be biased towards one person or another
 seven right now that fly is my enemy I'm not impartial right now
 but your king my dear King cricket match your qualities for doing a Raja Guna and you know what there's a good purple 26 you want to read it
 is the purport of sex so-called attachment detached and obligations pertain to the material nature which is Adam it which is an Amana emanation from the Supreme personality of God had but whenever the Lord descends and acts in this material world
he does so in his spiritual position all those activities would surely appear different spiritually their absolute and non different thus it is an imposition upon the Supreme Lord to say that he is envious of anyone or friendly to anyone
 Bhagavad Gita 911 the Lord says clearly a budget on Teen Mom would have to ride me when I descended human form appears on this Earth or within this universe without any change in a spiritual body or spiritual qualities in deed is never employed by the material qualities he is always free from such qualities but he appears to act under material influence this understanding is a wrong pizza or an imposition therefore Christian says John McCormack made if you
 whatever he does being always transcendental has nothing to do with the material qualities
if I'm your only devotees can understand the truth of how he acts the fact is that that Krishna is never a partial to any one is always equal to everyone but because of imperfect Vision it was by material qualities would impose material qualities upon Krishna and when one does so he becomes a mood ha or a fool when one could probably understand once the truth one becomes devoted to devoted and near Guna re from a Tio qualities
 simply by understanding the activities of Krishna one can become Transit dental and as soon as one is Transcendental he is fit to be transferred to the transit at the world Jeff bought a large on Manatee mom 80s or do not understand the activities of the of the Lord in truth is transferred to the spiritual world after he gives up his material body you can understand Krishna
thinking we want to try to understand if you think back to when your little kids like a real little kid
 it's play I'd like they fantasize and they pretend they're different things like they pretend a pirates or pretend it was a cop cops Cowboys and Indians baseball player but even with your friends you would play rolls right I have hats according to pretend it was policeman's hat okay see you or did someone play the criminal always and there would be some shooting probably going out shooting a resting punishing physical punishment they were generally the crooks were generally smaller than me so and when you're when you're kid when you play like that you actually fully immerse yourself in the role you fully immerse yourself in the play yes yes and so it and it said there's something that the kids
satisfying but they want to enter in and they want to play those roles and they they feel emotions and they feel excitement in its own and really although it's it's always challenging to say that's what Chris is hoopa in it and in some sense that's what Christmas is to me he's playing you know he is it's called Lila which means divine play and he's becoming immersed in it deeply deeply immersed in an Annex in through that experience seeing Russa experiencing exchanges of love like when he gets on that Battlefield
 he's going through a war like we're always really warm and and and he's become the Chariot driver of his close friend Arjuna and it said he's there if if he were just God sitting in a chair looking down on creation he would be experiencing what is is when he's driving a chariot lost in the play doing it out of love for his friend Arjuna
have to win this battle and then there's always other Lila is that are like hard to understand unless you're a devotee it just seems like like one of my favorite ones is Christian of a coward ranch or Cristiano or Christian is running away from the battlefield and he's a coward you're like shamed Krishna is like glorified he's worshipped in Gujarati rhymes Georgie Boy understood by the devotees as he just doesn't want to fight now sorry I took so many times and now he just doesn't want to walk away from it but but if we were to judge a child that's playing a game of cops and robbers and say why is he being so he really has animosity towards that other child no no no he's absorbed in the
play and Chris. He enters into this realm to play it because it's only because he's not a judge because he's not some cruel Tyrant because he enjoys Exchange in love he cuz he dies into the play he may appear to someone to be partial to one side or the other but actually is merciful to everyone on every side of the play
 I have to marry you going to sell you some are we can't marry Kathy I said got the thing to do you have a do you have this is the old Regal ladies of India this is what we do next we have Mara keeps very clever notes and then she has what we call it a ways or in our country we call them goodies
