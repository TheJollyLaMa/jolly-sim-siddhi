 I haven't been since 2018 so I'm ready to see all the changes this place gets more and more beautiful cuz it's like a garden in in in April as opposed to a garden in July just everything is grown in that place is just grown into itself back in the old days pushed me into stupid member that needs to go it's or like we loved it we appreciated it
 but it was under construction even you know there's always at me even before it was under construction we saw it was just a dry seems like just to dry you know
 area I'm around a swimming walking me out to the
 we're at the table and force was going to be going to him this is going to be a forest and I was thinking myself is a division do you have
Vision first and then it just comes anyway we're really looking forward to Lori and I dragged that dragged the chief because the chief and mayor are going to Mike koekoek I think in there in the cheapest a master Italian chef himself to Specialty Lori

 let us to buy going to hand it to people like the chief who are just like they get into bhakti and then all of a sudden they're like in America too for that matter but probably a lot of people out there all of a sudden they're changing their diet and people like the chief and mayor who are chefs in their own right
 they have to re change everything they cook that's a that's a difficult things specially if it's your profession or if it's your specialty so shout out to all the people going through that transition you and me Justin vegetarian for so long that we sort of like take it for granted life insurance first
they're just got to tell her it's a big deal it's a struggle for a lot of people especially if they shorted sometimes if your Chef you should have build your identity around your food and in your and your preparations Etc. To the people had to like step away from those things that there may be a little bit more deeply rooted then perhaps it was for you and me and you know 20 years old
 all right let's dive into the stream and by what time do it the right of the Musketeers on that I'm some little jam with the area where certain she might become witches are very mean to Conquest when should I be respectful of base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan aarti Arun reach you the super most human being
used batteries in a chamber, but regular tension class in the bottom of Tom and I will sweetheart we could eradicate it and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teacher to open my eyes with a side of knowledge I offer my way since he's there Lotus feet reading from the srimad bhagavat
 where are we where are we we are in
 8
 okay got it. Okay
12th chapter Canto 7712 812 date hearing
 again from the sage Naruto speaking to King yudhistira
 and he's sharing all the
 you can call them the duties you know their responsibilities the cold ethical codes and codes of conduct you know it can sound oppressive maybe to the Western mind right all these rules
 well there's a beauty in the self-discipline that we've been trying to highlight right and Beauty both the individual and as well as for society how we cooperate with each other how we step up for each other how we control or lower nature so that hopefully that you know we were better able to cultivate the higher nature sure I remember when when you when we were younger Rugrats you you had
at that point you left you had a natural enthusiasm for like taking on
 Boss different types of austerity and things like that I like I like no white sugar like that was one thing that what you know and then you do have another thing like that you know there's like all these boring that white death book or something like that I think about it you would encourage you to people would kind of catch on to encourage your yeah yeah no doubt but there was something healthy about that too and Wigmore for a while as Brahma tries we have like we like that we were in the green smoothies like in the 90s and Heidi one we're making like avocado sunflower sprouts for breakfast and what else is using chapatis and courage Sub-Zero and a half of avocado and a banana that's what we're having for breakfast and in it you know something like I don't know
Wim Hof kind of stuff that kind of thing you know you'll be ready for that kind of thing I should throw in a second group know we will be at Temple group would you fit just going to the whole morning program that we break away and we can do our own Guru Puja tour own unique gurus but together with all the gurus on the altar with all her that was a thing that used to do in Europe to pick it up from there
 now I just invented it and people also invent the same thing like people to people might invent electricity I just know you traveled in that area but you know why you talking about that because you're talking about self-discipline and in the end of that you know that the power of it in you know we all need to in our our our world may not encourage that so much you know it may be just trying to find happiness to external in in there is like
chaplain part of you know even Monday in society but he usually has to do with it paid right now I mean diet really big help healthy natural supplement called plunging breathing is popular again athleticism Triathlon so there was like a discipline not necessarily mind over matter but we just say Spirit overmind go all the way right we'll take it to the next in general the Tennessee is whenever there's any level of prosperity
 then there's a Tennessee for laziness you know to just sink into it whenever there's Prosperity under difficult circumstances naturally you take on you know you your burdens are forced upon you okay okay and and then when you're free of those you just like all that Miralax into it he have the luxury
lost yeah yeah and butt end and then we really become like this anemic kind of society insensitive there's no
 I don't know there's no real powerful Drive in life what to speak of like a powerful spiritual I remember when I was the day before I left to become a Brahma Cherry right like the guy I was I had this invitation from a sanyasi to travel with him
 and I remember sitting on a stoop in Saint Mark's Place in and I was talking to Harley Flanagan are they playing again it was like Bart Maher production of Guru right there yeah you know if you did for those that don't know you know if we've been we've interviewed him on the show but he was he's in a popular man it was a wild just as wild characters free characters it's worth watching that episode of you missed it just YouTube search Harley Quinn Harley Flanagan
so while we were sitting on the stoop and I was saying have this is it man because I already told her I'd like to have tomorrow I just go and I was like I was like I was just back then I did I didn't tell my landlord I was like disappearing and I just disappeared it just it's just like disappears everything was loose your back then especially in New York you know so it's just like I'm just this I'm going to be there with us will the whole scene was like that do you know so I'm just kind of disappeared from the scene and I'm going to go home and he knew the senior officers chatting with you knew I was going to take up his whole life and self-discipline and I remember him just saying frankly that point
 he said like, he said you know we sit around here and you know
 get high chase girls and listen to her eighth he was
even kind of like he was he was kind of talking down everything that we spend our youth getting ready yet even the music which is like so sacred to say can we listen to a dumb use it you know it's like he said it like that you know he was like really he was really speaking on that Eternal plane there's something beyond all this you're going for you is a good for you go for it you know and and it's it was just going to take up that austerity in life you know leave behind this kind of just wasting time and you know make a make a move you don't make the move in life and it was encouraging to me I was I was already going to go anyway but I was like yeah and it's like stepping to something different powerful disappoint yourself yeah it always feels good one little step towards discipline pushes you for more discipline it makes it easier easier in martial arts you want to start
running okay then the natural you're going to want to eat better right when you eat better they all lead like in the chain taste little step in our spiritual life is the same way if you listen to it if you listen to a lot of YouTube for audio books or something and then you just say you know what I'm going to push a little add a Little Krishna in there too and then all of a sudden that becomes very addictive and it can draw you out of all your other ones ever do that it's just like totally and then they're like what why am I going to do this all the time which I thought would be so hard for me yeah yeah if you want to read a few do you say I want to read for half an hour everyday I want to read bug of agita the first time it's like you know the name of this is little dry and the second time a little bit more into 3rd 4th 5th time you like I can really get into this 6 time like I want to return our you know it's just I know and that's what we're trying to do or trying to create healthy addictions
 ages creating healthy addiction
I'm with you every morning I never realized it to you
 that is the verse is going to sound weird the next the first person view these so let's get into them
 so why wouldn't I remember hearing now the shock of hearing that are the rules for the brahmacharya for the young monk right at the stage of life where you're young your baby preteen teenager and are you getting just it is for Learning and celibate life studying serving you know under respected Guru under respected teacher
 by the way the also points out that the spiritual master was generally not a monk the spiritual Master is generally a householder wants to
yeah but we tend to think they're all renuncie it's that the spiritual Master not even more commonly right yeah they did sometimes they had someone like a young just like it we read in remind I do know that they would take a young man with them assist them in their travels and so on but you have more often it would be a
 that's a whole another ancient cultures weird would come to your door and they say hey what would you like and he say I'd like your young son
 that would be like what nowadays would be likely to hit him with a stick right now back then it was like oh you want my son very honoured I'm very attached to the Sun but I have ten children you take the seven others
I think my child Rocco is still a little scared because there was a man in India really it was serious and I was like okay where do you live and he's like I will try and he was like I'll train him he was a Casado where did you meet him somewhere and where was he wondering if time to do live in Hardware I don't know who's I really felt like you were going to give me to this man and I was thinking about it I was like what can I offer you okay so we're here and we are these
 call Shirley Divergent ideas about how like as a young man you're not even supposed to be talkin about girls you're not even your house like right we got it from here to like High School
that's not happening in those ancient cultures you got you got a whole busy day laid out this keeping you engaged in keeping understand there's going to be time for for girls as we time for marriage and all that but right now we're learning what were working on your character or working you know get you ready so that when you do get with a girl you're going to be a good man I want to see on the message board who went to all boys schools and who went to all girl schools Mara which an all-girl school I was in high school I was thinking who would ever go to a girls school whatever go to Alba and that's because all I want to do is meet a girl now I'm thinking how could anybody go to learn everything is developed if the goal of Education according to the Greeks in the Indian is developed character and develop your education
 okay so it was so it gets more specific today we're going to get into it it's going to get weirder ready
you guys can tell me if these the spiritual Master is Young to care for his hair massage his body with oil or bathe him with affection like a mother okay
 I guess I thought I thought it was just bathe him but okay that makes me that's not as weird is my attention about this verse is kind of turning it around and flipping it back is that last verse in the brief proceeding versus it seemed like wow this is a very restrictive Society very rigid when you read this it makes you understand that if the wife of the spiritual Master wasn't Young
 then she might actually be very affectionate well it more so than we find in our in our present Society right that's what I might see what I find I think it's pretty normal in India in the sir
I see brahmacharya is Indian drama charges relate to women in a healthy way it's not a weird way it's just that's what the culture acts I think their defection friendly American American breathing is surcharge with sex trying to meet a girl and try to get you stage 2 or level 2 of some intimacy I feel like and I know Indians change radically sell but when we when I went there it wasn't like it was there was still some type of value system and ethics
 are there any more, more and more westernized so I think they just had high guardrails in relationship between men and women now and I used to think I get that but I wanted to highlight something out what I think is how many something else
 which is that at the same time you might have a very loving affectionate relationship
with another was yesterday we talked about the seven mother's right
 hello yeah where are you at something like that very poignant but sort of like risque so I'm not going to say it go let it go. It's completely relevant I am with you I think when you use the word risque it it scares me so but whatever but my point was that we live in this world were we don't even though our next door neighbors have the time where you know our family means just the nuclear family and even that breaks up and splits in it and in the you know kind of disintegrates easily what do here it's kind of shown that the the wife
teacher
 they have a motherly affection for you so much so that she cares for you kind of intimately it and it lets let's be clear when it says like bathe like in India see people like bathing the kids out on the street all the time it's like you know they got their wearing something with their little kids if they're not wearing anything but like you do people actually bathe after they have a little gum Sean a little wraparound baby says bad with affection
 I paid him with all the interesting see I thought it was like bathing also like Mara should not bathe booty well I'm wondering what the faction Maribel booty with a fraction
 I make some food look welcome there
 translations of the semi police are two valves
 Brahma Cherry Tree on 88 come on
come on I'm digging into to the commentaries of the other charges here earlier
 animals attached that's progress translation
 it's the only translation I've got here what's going on what's going on okay but maybe you're right maybe you're right maybe that's what that all that isn't what I mean if you're going to sell some of the oil you may as well be but you. That's a common thing that a mother does for a kid in India you know you kind of rub some oil all over their body to care for them you know I care for their hair so put my again my point being is that it's saying it's if the the wife of the guru's elderly that she very well may be very motherly to you. Everybody loves a doting mother
now you feel that you feel welcome you feel loved I feel you know so yeah so they're saying if the wife is Young hey you know don't get too into it that's all I'm saying and then it just sort of a healthy boundary now in the west we Have No Boundaries around that we but then again we cross these boundaries on a regular basis you know I looked like to use the example of a guardrail in a row would you know the guardrail give some protection it scratches the car if you hit it but it protects you from going right over the cliff very often times if there was no guardrail there
 you could actually go off the road for a while you know cuz the guardrail is set in so you could actually go past where the garlic will would be and still be okay but the problem is all you have to do is sneeze and you're over the cliff to an India you will find very very high guard rails protect you from What's the
Pierre unwanted unwanted pregnancy all the time like skull I just like in America we say you'll just have one glass of wine is good for you but why don't we have some problems just have one glass one why is it proper to say to glass of wine with dinner and some people can handle one glass of wine and it will there is nutrition nutritional benefit perhaps but here's the problem there's a lot of people that can't handle one glass of wine and they have to have 19 glasses of wine so we keep these guardrails incredibly High why so we don't go over the edge and come create havoc in our spiritual life and that is a real problem and that's why there are 12-step meetings in church basements all around the world because
people can't have one glass of wine with dinner so when people try to justify things yeah sometimes you can pass that guardrail and it doesn't wreck you but be careful because there's people that look up to you that you may think I woke up still. What's the big deal just one maybe they can't have one glass of wine well here it is still leaving the door in one since this is a liberal State me where cuz it's leaving the door open for this kind of infection is long as the guru's wife is in young I agree
 massage the body with oil I mean
 unless you really want to share and share what you want to share with that's okay but you know imagine like you're 9 years old
 right and when you when you show up to your
home every morning it's like your second home it's like it's not nice or else they wouldn't do this they wouldn't even make all these statements was 9 and she's young go to the I know but if she's young that means that the danger is if your past puberty that's the danger of having a young that's exactly what I'm explaining here if you know you said 9 years old I'm trying to paint a picture of people's minds
 imagine you're 9 years old boy going to your group home for instruction and it's like a second home for your love there just like it's like your own family and and the guru's wife hey sweetheart, come over here I see you're like your your dreadlocks again a little crusty let me help you with that you know it's like are you got this matted hair it's like she's got that she's like another mother to you and so you know
look I can see your Skin's getting all dried I come here you know it in and she could you know we have to have all kind of laws and everything nowadays that would make this you know
 this would be setting up our kind of red flags but in a healthy Society. Your motherly affection but it's saying that if she's a young lady we don't you know we don't do not get an elderly lady then then it might be not this affection may be like it within a save contacts if she's a young lady then know that's going to be distracting very distracting for the room in the commentary I think your bathing thing we're going to head out. Sure if it holds up I don't know if prod pod
 would even be familiar with that kind of phrase if you know where they would have actually had someone with affection your cuz what he says in the concert says this relationship between the student or disciple and the wife of the spiritual Master teacher is like that between a son and mother
 a mother sometimes cares for her son
I called Mia's hair massaging his body with oil or bathing him
 simile the wife of the teachers also a mother a GroupMe and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way if the wife of the teachers a young woman however the young Grandma Tricia not allow such a mother to touch
 okay we will beat this this is good now we get to it like a famous verse right that it's just going to speak to this principle more in a more General sense woman is compared to Fire and man is compared to butter right it's a fact about a wonderful letter and fire together
 therefore man should have boy dissociating even with his own daughter
 I wish I could handle my anxiety snuggle my 19 year old daughter
 in a secluded place
that was just a weird I mean that's the high guard rail is we could list the horror stories right I mean it's some it's heartbreaking yeah I don't know if that's sexual or just like demented
 what do you mean like there's a difference anyway similarly avoid association with other women intimate so it's private associate associate with women only four important business and not otherwise so this is a culture there again in America even within vaishnav communities we don't have those right guard rails we sometimes pass those guard rails but we should understand there's a reason why those guardrails are there cuz very often especially here and now we're seeing it in India
we drive our car right off the cliff spaghetti tempted right we get tempted by culture to drive very close to the edge and then we get chastise by culture or saying when we do go over the edges they don't have dare you look what you've done who would do anything like this has to end so many ways to live on the edge and and yet I'm going to read you something that's when we hear this receipt on my God this is like so rigid and ensure the proper can men have his instructions they sound like this is a whole different culture, come on in and I'll get ahold of my horse how would you like me to to say please stop interrupting me with me
what colors make you feel good and I want to share with you some proper that's that from she'll probably shows his flexibility
 his liberality or you know it in the same kind of thing this is this is from a commentary to the Tri-County charge me to ADI Lila text 31 and 32 where he's talking about how I came from one culture but when I came into the West I recognize they had a different culture and rather than getting caught up in the detail getting too caught up in the details the cultural differences
 I'm not going to try to to force
 culture on someone I'm going to try to focus on the main thing that's the most important thing right so he says and a charia and it here by hre he means like
 an important spiritual leader
 an Innovative important spiritual leader
Charlie who comes for the service to the Lord cannot be expected to conform to a stereotype
 we must find the ways and means by which the knowledge of Krishna Consciousness may be spread
 sometimes jealous people criticize the Krishna Consciousness movement because it engages equally both boys and girls and distributing love of God is that funny we just read things that would be considered sexist in in the separation between male and female improper thing actually being very liberal with what's going on I'm being ridiculously liberal and conservative or Orthodox Hindus hope you like boys and girls are you no coming here together holding hands they they they live in the same ashram together they go out together and you know they did the girls are giving the classes like it's a different thing so he says sometimes that he's talking about his own
my brother's here specially you know it and in other maybe other Brahmin of these texts and apply them in the world that were living it rather than like too rigidly where everything just collapses he understood okay let's understand the essence of what's being said so he goes on sometimes jealous person to criticize the Krishna Consciousness movement because it engages equally both boys and girls and distributing love of God had not knowing that boys and girls in countries like you're going to marry them it's very freely that was her property he's kind of like these fools and Rascals criticized the boys and girls in Krishna Consciousness for intermingling he's defending
 the his Western disciples who are being criticized by these very Orthodox thinking kind of people but these Rascals should consider is using very heavy language
but the hills Rascal funny how it's not really a heavy word the most head up things to say naughty but these Rascals should consider that one cannot suddenly change a community social Customs however since the boys and the girls are being trained to become preachers these girls are not ordinary girls but as good as their brothers were preaching Krishna Consciousness there for to engage both boys and girls and fully Transit all activities is a policy intended to spread Krishna Consciousness movement these jealous fools who criticized the intermingling of boys and girls will simply have to be satisfied with their own foolishness because they cannot think of how to spread Krishna Consciousness by adopting ways and means that are favorable for this purpose they're stereotyped methods will never help spread Krishna Consciousness you know what this reminds me of
is 1 time potty chair this morning was given the class I got to share this on the show before but it was in my poor and he was it's like when someone who's really doing something is being criticized by people that are doing practically nothing and finally get fed up and say this is absurd so it's here at the swapmeet was speaking in in my poor to an international audience of of devotees that it come there for Festival
 and he was sharing about
 this program that he did in South Africa in a huge stadium with tens of thousands of people who knows part like 50 or 80 thousand do something massive audience
 where they had cure time and distributed you know thousands and thousands and thousands place a Sodom and the the most practical important person in the world at that time was Nelson Mandela
recently you been freed and was you know respected chanting and dancing with them giving the keynote saying you know and and then part of that had African girls young girls wearing some kind of outfit that was almost like a grass skirt kind of thing and and doing some kind of African dance some criticize and it was being criticized by devotees of these girls are dancing you know this isn't our Vedic standard you know it was like that I'm on the periphery that's why I live on the periphery I feel like I can't be right in the mix of banning but but what he what he said and he said he could speak with such Young
 almost like Southern Baptist kind of enthusiasm yeah you know like it look at it with that kind of was a kind of
mood you know and he was in so huge and he was saying that you know when he described the whole thing it said and then people criticize this and what did he say was it was so poignantly nobody said something if if you're thinking like this it's not something that was going with you know it wasn't a problem with the program there's a problem with your mind you know you're so caught up in your your rigid Orthodox ways that you're missing the whole point is look thousands of people happily embracing the idea of hearing a chanting about Krishna this is a beautiful saying you go find some little detail and you misjudge it or misunderstand it missing by everything so although we're getting these rigid kind of instruction instructed to say they're also applied thoughtfully it's the same thing is like Alexia with flexibility is saying these Rascals these jealous people the same thing it's like pulling a
the worst in other people to find fault if the good see the good see you write that down Linda see the good alright text text 10 as long as a living entity is not interested in calling a person a living entity living as long as your wife you're a living entity oh yeah realized and as long as he is not independent of the misconception of identifying with his body just nothing but a reflection of the original body in the senses oh that's a big topic right there but okay he cannot be relieved of the conception of Duality which is a pain in my chest by The Duality between men and women right that's there is every chance that he will fall down because his intelligence is bewildered I don't you haven't read my book yet but
this is one one time when I was in New Braunfels sorry I was thinking won't why I'm newly celibate why can't we talk to women if I'm a brahmacharya if if in fact we're not the body anyway tell me we're not the body we're not the body wife and he said to her I said and I thought this was great when you're in clever he said because
 we Are Spiritual Beings
 but you become convinced you're a man when you're speaking intimately with a woman instead of being convinced you're a spirit so you become very convinced you're a man I thought oh yeah that's right that's when I feel like the most manly men aren't around an attractive woman
 okay then okay okay I think that's it then we're out of time
 yep
Martin says and this is why I from Western perspective it feels a way to control women when men have to control their own fire both set I mean is that it could definitely be misapplied and what she's saying is right men have to control that's what it say
 okay I've got to control your fire right now you could show your butter
 I'm better today Raghu Babu so hopefully you'll do good yesterday critiqued her yes
 there is a beauty that's Beauty like that is a mug t-shirt bumper sticker boo that's what we got to do now we need something we can well done Linda and we can walk away with
