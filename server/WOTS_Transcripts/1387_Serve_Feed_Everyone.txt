 all right nugget time we're going to the way that's a nice been an extra shirt you have this
here's the Nugget it's for Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali what a character
 your mother was his name before he was that songs like mister mister John's near me song was one of them YouTube it's great okay, Tali said service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth
 okay
 read it again
 service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth so we're here on Earth
and otherwise you're right you could be living a place and not paying that's called a freeloader or a squat squat here cuz tuba pay some rent here's the rent you got to get back you got to accept that people are taking care of you that we are being nurtured you being loved your being maintained is the mindset of a devotee what a brat whatever religion you are devoted just needs to go to the god you don't have to you have to say why I'm not a devotee like you guys if you're if you feel like you're trying to devote yourself to a higher purpose Ohio cost to light the truth to love to God guess what you my friend are a devotee he right so our service to others that's the rent you pay to have and it comes from recognizing that
 you are maintained you are loved people have been people go out of it have gone out of their way for you people have given back to you and you appreciate all that you've got whereas the opposite is true with material thinking which is I'm entitled to
the stuff I got it early bird I was looking for a right they're entitled the government owes me my family owes me a stupid dad owes me right there as you know life is always balance right it's this generally two sides to something and I think we're living in this polarized world right now so we get triggered by anything we choose one side and we get triggered by anything that speaks to the other side but I think there's a
 there's a polarity or there's two different ways of kind of understanding one's place in this world I think you could say it's eastern and western there's some truth to that whereas like the Eastern world is like you're indebted you you know you by being in this world by being born in this world you actually
 have some debts to pay to the people that have provided so much for you that means your forefathers that
people in general where is let me put this shit this more of a communal concern in the East there's more of a feeling of like my life is an obligation in my life
 to serve the community and in some sense and I think the Western particulate American maybe you no like I think Americans like what the whole thing represents is all about freedom and freedom means lack of of debt or you know lack of responsibility to the community here you're free to do whatever you want to do we kind of put that idea on the altar like so
 rabidly on post that that we can become like very entitled and I think there's you know we're reading now about
 the duties of the householder and the duties of the householder is really dry want to talk
to like hey it at this stage of life you you're really meant to take up service to others you're really meant to embrace that if you don't
 because you have this money and house in spouse and family and in all of this kind of like a personal realm that you're operating in more intensely than ever before you know when you're the brahmacharya when you're The Young and the celibate student you know your life is dedicated to serving your elders right and being trained by then they're serving you and you're serving them but then you hit that married life any ideas now you got your own money your own home your own freedom
 don't get lost in that don't don't let it be a pit that you fall into and just get lost into this world of entitlement that entitlement we've all seen children who act totally entitled no yes we had
it's sort of like
 separateness from anybody but you meaning you see this a lot in the East like family tradition and you have a debt to your grandfather and your great no one in our family line has done this before you know I've got to make my ancestors proud or pictures of the grandparents or great-grandparents on the altar it it's like a little bit but for the most part I barely know if my grandparents are the people just get married and move away from their family there is no connection in the western world they're saying in the west I find that maybe I may be crazy and Diego much more, see your here's my family tree this is here and they can drive back and you some Integrity with wanted to please your elders the whole Eastern World guess at what is so what went so wrong in the west appreciation but that's why I held it there's a bow
because I like for instance in India unless it's carefully monitored and carefully thought about you know like the Black Prince's depression School in India is just like too much did the pressure on like someone marrying into a family of God it can be allowed to and while you're marrying yeah there's too much said that they're even I say that because we were in a huge Renaissance in India of you just didn't date now people date they just a different people know what did that and then deal we were younger your parents arranged everything right for the Ava Lee
 let's get her on the show with her talk to us we want to find out about the marriage from California right now yeah I grew up in a song
right yes the Tamil is like they don't even really don't even learn Hindi and tomorrow they're like this is the original language we're learning this language is the closest to Sanskrit correct okay Buddy says there's is the closest to Sam's Club marriage wasn't arranged was not arranged how old were you and that was it in India or America but my husband before coming to us he was living in Singapore
 okay yeah still in eastern considered going to Southeast Asia and how can you get a title get anything to explain this to us what
parent contact parents
 in my case my family had my horoscope made and then they kind of spread out give it to a few prospective families and then they shot instead the boys and they told me like some good replies with you is good for you then I short listed them shortlisted first appearance said we're going to go to the families that we trust where we see like they have good values and had two interviews families are they part of your community and he said they have their standards and based on that there shortly and then I give my standards
 I was in my status for like something
is that considered a standard like handsome do we even get to go there if we're going to choose a husband do you get to go like well you know I like having a full head of hair and stuff like that so I didn't have but you should have added that to your standard if you have to my family they wanted to make sure like the boy's family is from a good family they have a good reputation in the community also enough enough built to take care of me and they want to make sure the daughters care for very reasonable intelligence Wheatley with passion we live with us she's the one I saw are we look at each other across the room and I knew she was the one because she was hot
 Bob
short list that we wasn't on the parents
 also astrological compatibility 80% like the first guy that shot mr. They were too so just dropped it and even asked me so you don't even see a picture of them right now is this like not even a photo and show them after the list of yours on the short list of in the short list of theirs then you see a photo of them but I didn't really see you like I mean cuz I was like so adamant on my standards so finally like when but then who are these people
 but then my husband like back then like I didn't know he was but my family was
consistent with him and his family so I decided to give it a shot and then things worked out and then we got to know each other then we got married a year after 2019 to 1920 for 5 years and your parents are prepared to live with my aunt my paternal and she was the one who arranged all of this tell me tell me how long will your parents married for so my mom passed away when I was very young maybe 11 12 years old so my dad remarried to have a stepmother but my dad passed away when I was 23 okay because they did that they have very very low divorce rate and how often did you see did you did but you
hated your husband before you married him or so we had like a chance to meet and then within 10 days to go to engaged because it's it it's like shopping for a car you know what I mean you know what you want it's like an educated consumer I think it was in the Gandhi film where they talked about this for like I think the Gandhi said like in the west you you marry the person you love in the East you love the person you marry so in other words it's a kind of your building a love based on something that we're going to work together at this marriage and we're going to Starve Together going to serve each other and through that the love develops Mara note that one down through do do do you love the Bell UPS
I am grateful for you is more important that's what he said you see here this is what we're talkin about that entitlement and its we're going to get into the show we're going to get into these verses about like if you have wealth cuz that's what you have when your household ideally some how you engage it and it has to do with serving others and kind of
 you know a lot of it has to do with putting on events you know whether it's just like in your own home and you're inviting people into your home or whether it's like creating a public event where when you feed everyone and you have some kind of come over and you feed them up at this I think you know it would have been double he's discussing is actually kind of like a softer version of like even a stronger traditional kind of
it's not only there in the Indian culture I take was just there in cultures in the past like where you wouldn't even see the bride or the groom like they pull up that Veil inside the first time you've seen them yeah it's like that was a surprise that's my favorite very rare thing that I didn't know that's how much their culture was like removed from like the individual's personal concerns in was more of communal family kind of thing you do while we have her here you have like a connection with your grandfather or great-grandfather like is there some family lineage type of dedication you have
 so my friend my father kind of mood away from South India
so I never got to see my grandparents are we really so I can have the school and then we'll work or that's even kind of a modern thing like I would have had to go so far to find your dad or religious family. Not that much but my extended family they are religious no one really knows what they're doing is really showing hey this is how it all works this is why it makes sense this it yeah it almost like he almost like did Hinduism for dummies if you think about it it's like we just been fine
all this stuff ritualistic what do you know why we don't even know why we're doing it but we know it's a good thing because it because their ethical people and secular people still say it like you know what go to church on Sunday don't say things like that even though they have maybe never gone to Church lyrics children that just something feels right about to do it yeah so there's a lot of rituals and a lot of ethics and stuff like that's really know what's just worship our family. I don't know exactly that little altar in the hand is doing a little bit more than say Catholics probably you know what what else is impressive like if you look at the runoff swamy Temple that you know the right of gopinath Temple Mumbai which has like just living on the property like 80 young monks right and they're all like a second allogen people coming out of the best schools in Mumbai
 and then they go into the college's that's the thing they going to let you go in the IIT
which is like the super high-level University they're only like the top you know where students can manage to get into and you go right there and you begin to explain this traditional way that those Tunes are there they've all grown up and families were people are ringing bells and doing pooches but they don't really know why and it is someone on that level of scientific engineering thought it just doesn't appeal to them you go right there and you begin to explain it on a whole different level of how the whole thing works and you turn those people on to it and then it's like you got a force within Society now with the most educated people really understand what this is all about and they can go out of represent I give class there do you know It T-Pain by Mumbai
 congratulations right now if you want to do today that's okay I would really feel the need to do that it doesn't
according to Henry a message board fascinating my brother my brother and me that Dinesh another show all right thank you that was good
 okay you ready to get his Guerilla growing in the musket guy that I'm shaving my time which is every means a conquest was respectful of basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Ricci the super most human being like a mother starts watching the lightning and tissue to be awesome day of the author dust-up racial boundaries you need some backup at Save-A-Lot give it to you tomorrow okay back till about 2 tonight
my regular Thompson classes in the box with Tom and veterinary services. But he's all that is troublesome to Hart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with Transit at the songs will be established as a revocable fact oh my God I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes are the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance at their load of speed-reading from the srimad bhagavatam Canto 7 chapter 14 test 15 1% yeah yeah we got into the hole
 that is what we talked about this a lot here we got to skip over stuff if you're just reading this on your own
 yeah it's all about you read it and you don't get it you'll be looking I'm just going to skip it you know what I mean so it's good that's what we're supposed to do
dissect this tease it out get some reflection talk about her own experience in okay
 now instructions to the householders and I got next
 I never even said the word household there before I was a devotee said they had somebody thing household or married people are married people householders
 he was looking at the houses anymore
 okay everyday one should worship the Supreme Being who is situated situated and everyone's part okay and on the bass on this basis once it separately worship the demigods saintly persons ordinary human beings and living entities ones for Father's there go and one's self this is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth custom but you're good in this way one is able to worship the Supreme Being in the core of everyone's are tying it all together
okay yeah they said that this isn't just as it's not just some Halo virtual this is to become deeply spiritual realize and connect with God in your own heart but you're operating in this world and everything in this world is in connection to that God within your heart and so you have the Dave us how does one worship the Davis
 jelly Temple rituals right Pooja and sewing you know it's like you go to those like those big temples in India that used to have lots of little temples all around them right like there's a main
 sanctum sanctorum that witch like it's a central feature right of the temple yeah we're like let's say it's a temple to when they use Latin words to describe him do things he doesn't worry them out of the Sacred like the the garbage and but then around that'll be like smaller
temples where anyone can go up and makes our offering easily you know like you don't have to stand in line for a long time and you could go there and you do on Tuesday I worship you know things like that you know
 your Saturday supposed to Monroe and then you can over here right now come on we know what I'm already home the garbage we have the house the womb house so then providing or light or water or everything we got you know we got to pay rent for that be due to show some gratitude saintly persons how do they serve the same a person's rug
 how to service Haley persons
 do you understand the person you want to serve them what would you do if you could read your service to their body like honey most Commerce and food
there I mean you worship by Pooja or you could worship with them physically if they're there you welcome them in you feed them or in our case we serve saintly people by spreading a message because you're serving their mission okay I'm doing I'm just talkin about in the most common traditional way of General you to invite us and the person to your home and feed them right yeah maybe so please stay here and things like that credibly comment in Indian culture that they do the police come to my home please come to my home I was good at my home and I'm not even saintly I get invited in people's homes on a regular basis please please come I'm like I'm traveling with 25 people there like that's okay you bring them all to people's houses that I don't even know if you act
I don't just people I know that I don't invite for two people to my house like I said maybe we do hear you do invite 40 people to our house okay sorry to cut you if if if you actually really believe in karma then you see this is like the huge opportunity and answer you invite those people over you no ordinary human beings how do you serve them a lot of times that has to do with feeding them try taking the opportunity if you go to like a Hindu temple has contact with you know in like the same today's fisa sponsored by
 write the blah blah family because the ideas I want to serve everyone I want in a great way to do that is she you know you look at talking about this entitlement versus like obligation kind of dichotomy look at the wedding ritual right I think about how
 if you read about what
in these ancient texts yeah it's kind of like oh okay see Tamara dram you know it whatever or maybe that's kind of good kids cuz they get married in ayodhya
 or did they get married. Yeah they got married before they went basso ROMs parents weren't even there who can you have right now that McKayla great one great but you know generally like your hair like that the parents are like they're giving and charity on the day of the wedding they're feeding everyone sumptuously they're giving charity to the brahmins Charities to everyone in the whole idea was this sense that we want this marriage to be blessed we want everybody here within their heart to be feeling good about this and blessing it and so by serving everyone
 that's why you invite a lot of people to a wedding
is so that you have the opportunity to serve them on that nothing of the western attitude right
 if you invite a lot of people to the wedding that the motive may be to impress others
 oh yeah don't know that never enters into anyone's mind when they're having a wedding is impressing and never let no don't think I know what I'm going to get it I just don't think it's impressive to have the Kardashians come to your wedding is anyone following me the Ambani marriage people showing up at that wedding Justin Timberlake was there I think I'm okay
 now how many times have we heard this kind of thing and I and I don't mean to shame anyone by saying this but you will go ahead but but how many times have to hear something like what are we inviting all these people this is our day
I like the wedding is this is our day we begin to think of the wedding is this is my special day to be the star of the show everyone is going to be looking at me you didn't fail Amy the the Eastern idea is more like we're inviting all these people for our own benefit so that we can receive Their Blessings on this important day so that the debutante specious beginning
 hey yeah yeah so that should there's the entitled thing who the hell is one of these people doing here this is our day to have fun and be the stars of the show I've been thinking about how this day is going to play out of my mind where I'm the prayers ass on the princess no no no it's like you want to go
those people in you want the opportunity to serve that's why I have to be fees to and all that so that you can please all those people and so they can receive Their Blessings and that's what that's the idea is that when you have wealth in those householder years you use it to serve all this and that is what helps prevent you from falling into the pit of entitlement and just Indulgence you selfish Indulgence right of the message board everybody who had the very expensive over the top wedding put it on the board right now okay
 and then I got married for under a thousand bucks and then where do you get married in Dallas
 in Dallas okay I did it for 250 bucks
 oh here we go
a check that M right now I'm at her and make sure she's okay
 hang on. The breathing breathing so we heard that you're using your wealth
 to worship other so that you can connect with God in your own heart because you're used to worship in the Dave has the saying the person who ordered it also mentions the animals and other live all other living entities Emmys animals freeze you wanted them to take care of them on your desk and yeah you take care of animals are right yeah
 okay yeah this we do
 and put all of this again is not to impress others not to eat it's not even to call to be good karma what here's what you're doing is doing what you're doing is explaining what it wedding should be you don't even have to go east or west here you have to
your ID is there in the Westerville just so much lost touch with it but we lost touch with and I'm sure Indians have to but this is the this is the substance behind the wedding we want blessings we want to make a commitment in a perhaps a sacred place in front of priests family members are our best friends we want to make public statements write a creative some scarra an impression in our Consciousness when things get rough which they inevitably do here was a time we're both very sober-minded we are around all these people that we love in a holy place and we made a bold commitment and we take a photo of it and put it on The Mantel and that's the important subject of it it's to help us also when things are things get tough as well but what I like what you're saying you're you're you're giving the why because it can get lost in an ego thing like the fairy Prince
holiday but there is substance behind the marriage people say I was just a piece of paper means nothing
 that's because something isn't it it's important statement to the universe and end it but in all of this is being shared again in the context of not even
 definitely not like him pressing others but not even in the context of cultivating Good Karma here involved with time of hearing we do this in order to connect with the Supreme Lord in one's heart and in the core of everyone's hard right this is all moving towards that lets lets her text 16 continuation here
 when one is enriched with wealth and knowledge which are under his full control and by means of which he can perform yagya or please the Supreme percent of godhead one must perform sacrifice offering
relations to the fire according to the directions of shastra in this way one should worship the Supreme personality of godhead so if you have wealth you know imagine once you get the wells are you live the simple life as a monk in early days and then you're just kind of sleeping simply needing simply and surveying and your time is really engaged in serving the guru and and and learning
 and then suddenly you're on your own like Alicia's cut loose and and you have money
 and in the Temptation is to get lost in that in a selfish spiral so now what's the being laid out here is here's some here's a here's that speaking in a rational way about your obligations in life and how you should engage that wealth and so it's saying that
should do yoga right you should and those these offerings as young as his performances of y'all going to do some
 it kind of like there's two ways you can think of it right one is that you do would like daily yourself and again you know like you might have that little fire pit in the center of the home you know in the courtyard where morning and evening you you spend 20 minutes or half an hour chanting mantras and making offerings to bring your mind to you know the gratitude that want you to have her everything it was receiving a life you make an offer. That's a wave daily training your mind but there's also ideas of like let me take a certain percentage of my income
 and let me engage it in a way that I serve everyone and you would put on these events and invite everyone to come and feed everyone you know so it's kind of like if I have weld let me put on a vent which draws everyone's attention to like the highest most edifying object before
and honor all those people that have come by by serving the by feeling that maybe I'll give them a little gift sometimes you give them like some cloth right like that's like a cotton you like there's a nice don't deal with the Jews do with Shabazz cultural hear the courses they was rooted in in spirit sometimes they become more like social Gatherings and family gatherings but the idea is that it's a spiritual gathering in the sunset song or when people come together to talk about sot or Eternal topics truth right to talk about truth that's a powerful thing it's it's an equivalent of a Pious or transcendental Hardy within what we know has Hinduism where you have somebody talk at you have some chanting a bunch of people make food and you party and that's what a party was it's a Transit Dental
there's a huge part of this culture
 shabbat shalom shabbat shalom juice to a family get-together I mean a Pious nice family thing which is a nice thing to say something most people are disconnect with your family but I'm sure the origins were get together and talk about how to have a spiritual connection with within your family those Jewish Mothers were will remind you of your obligations Martin says it's the holiest what does shabbat shalom mean for reaching out left and right just you know what it is called phone a friend Martine how are you
 I'm good how are you this is Martin from me
originally from France how are you good to see you every day every week you know is the day of rest till you're not supposed to cook stew like life to another very observant Jews that Saturday correct right Friday night Sunset to Sunset okay Friday night until Friday night Sunset to suck and also I want to wait yeah I know so you bring a relationship. You are why do you bringing the Bride of the Peace of Shabbat into your life into your schedule like your home
you know you like candles you said prayer you bring life into your soul and your heart to me that you break bread you know the Father which is a braided bread and you said the bread blessings and yeah that isn't there a Jewish holiday is one of the main ones but I'm forgetting which one we're like before you celebrate your supposed to kind of make peace with all of like the people in your life may be passed from Sunset to Sunset and again how are ya right now we are near five thousand seven hundred and something and and so no food no water no nothing you're not supposed to drive to go to Tempe and he's supposed to be here all day and pray so there is a lot of prayers to Antonio self
 individually
none of us are perfect and we all pray and we all do things you know that I'm not always kosher and also and beautiful prayers and then we are you know what is it that you know within ourselves as a community and we could be fine so what is it that before the actual day like building up to the day you would put maybe apologize to someone on Yom Kippur okay you know and then through this. Of time you you know you read you your stuff to do your inspection you do your journey you walk your path within what do you have to actually apologized to spend if you ever been like you know it's coming up I got to make that call or give you just been like whatever
 I don't know I mean
you can I'm not an expert you know I left I am a reformed you and you know I send you a tonne that's what I've heard at least that was the idea that I can't really do honor this day properly and in bring my mind to where it has to be my Hardware has to be until I've worked out these things with the other people in my life I mean it's always someone that you either you know well you don't know why we are intimate Wiz and say you know I'm sorry I hurt you I'm sorry I didn't diss you know I'm sorry that your boss had stretched out the neck of my sweater
so much, nality right someone based on able to apologize because it's too frightening to write to someone you know so you can make yourself stories inside your head and then you keep going that way we know where that leaves us with our own podcast using this site dropping all this knowledge right now thank you Martine thank you thank you for loving me I love having you Indian Consultants are Jewish Consultants
