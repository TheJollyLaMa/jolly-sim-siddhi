 I will here's a here's a lovely night 7 a.m. on Sunday everybody's got an unmarked at 7 a.m. to print 7 a.m. Sunday yeah usually do at 8 a.m.
 what did you do today this is from Anonymous you might know him either there's a lot of he's famous for a lot of quotes must be some Greek and Roman guy only goes by one name like Seneca Aristotle anonymous
 a few people seem to be claiming this quote but like modern-day speakers are authors or something so really I'm going to chat gbt Anonymous quotes and then I put my name on them
like why not they're up for grabs why not just claim it as yours I mean you can say why not you could say why that's why
 okay here's what Anonymous says the heaviest burdens that we carry are the thoughts
 in our head
 maybe they've never built a stone wall before those are pretty heavy burdens too but yeah the heaviest you know this is why I like to recovery groups so much because they deal with the thoughts in your head a lot is that true recovery people out there riding on the board that
 just the process of going through your moral inventory of your own issues and just like coming to terms with us and then seeing where you taken other people
inventory that's in the 12-step quote if you take another pic of you to feel you're so worried about what other people are doing with their life oh my God and that in the end you could get into everybody else's mind and everybody else's problems and that stirs up a whole spring of like a resentments that you have towards people and hatred that you're carrying around with and a bitterness you have and it's like these things although
 you know I can't remember I did something I posted something somewhere and someone wrote me about yeah you got to watch out for this guy this guy's full of crap and he's horrible and I was thinking why do you care about this guy so much what people are so interested in other people's lives they become instead of becoming god-centered they become like and the me centered they're all about their enemy out there and they keep the keep a whole plethora of enemies in their head and it becomes like a burden for them
and it's almost like what what what the news media is a cultivating to find your favorite anime and then and then talk about them again and again and again with that you'll find some joy in your tribe but it really is just like I hate mongering and we become
 people who become hateful and that becomes the biggest bird in our minds become worried about all these things and and and and we carry that around and sometimes it's not even just a person is just a it's just a feeling of anxiety and stress and worry that that is might have a tiny grain of Truth in reality but we blown it up to be massive and Massa and we saw that a lot during the pandemic be here just living in fear living and worried living in distress and it just becomes a burden in the mind you remember when we were growing up
everything was about a nuclear war do you remember that exist in the same way today was there's always that threat that the Russians are going to Mama's especially earlier in the like the 70s and plums and dig a hole in your backyard Fallout shelters were sure it was a thing and we live like that
 all the head are you know I think was Mark Twain that said something like I'm some of the worst things in my life never happened yes he just created in my head and there's a difference between being a prepper like I think it's good to be prepared and because things can be very important to have weapons and food
you have a secret bomb-shelter there on the farm I got a backhoe and I'm going to build one that's a bomb shelter I think it's good to be prepared
 but thanks and it ended be a little bit down to be a little independent from everything I think there's a beauty in being quote Off the Grid there's a very beautiful and be able to grow vegetables and live off the land and it is a very beautiful thing because we become like look at look behind me if you have a video look at that domesticated dog he's gotten he would be destroyed in the wild for guys we are become domesticated animals ourselves so I think there was a little Barrel this conversation has a lot of survival if you had a hero's post apocalyptic scenario no
I was just saying these these worries are hap happen in the mines and it'll often times they don't we get back to where I was going with that the proper sometimes can get so obsessed with it they have they suffered tremendously you and I know people who've lost their mind during Y2K right there Y2K and the turn of the century to shut down and we're going to work is going to crumble everything's good and sometimes it will most like wish it did well there not some of them within the devoted to you there's some people in there but just me and a couple rings Ridge to Ridge Elementary
 you know there's
 we're going to switch seeing Baba time but we see it in life like the campus comparison of the person that's a burden
to the unburden print like an unburdened person is very attractive right it's like love them. They're not carrying any heavy baggage to Carefree to have me and the burden person is like oh my God I was so I'm carrying all this stuff you know it's like its misery like carrying all this stuff in my back you know you will see that when people travel right some people travel real life
 some people worry your unburdened is your dad we need this money. And then when it comes time to travel in there like all burdened with it it's like hard I'm going to make a public declaration right now for everybody to hear scuba is very unburden his mind is very P I have my burdens but you're you're good you're very very good and you might be a devotee actually I've got one but you're very unfair I remember when the when the pandemic was happening I was stressing out of my mind it might be fun to go back to those episode
and watch me like breaking down as I went in to Trader Joe's and nothing was on the shelves I was like and you were and you were cooped up in your 800 square foot apartment 800 it looks like you were peaceful I'm going to give you all could appreciate that but remember when we were back in that in that chapter one of the most entertaining sections of Bob with Tom where this whole conflict between duck show who's butter burn with resentment with resent maybe it's a common resentment burden with resentments towards his son-in-law
 oh yeah fathered bothered by people who are looking
they're looking for it what do you mean by that but we had you know we had daksha food he's burdened with his resentments and he's directing them at a verbally explicitly publicly venting and Lord Shiva that lordship is entirely unimportant he's unburdened Eddie's easily angered but he didn't become angered their who did you know cuz I was directed at him it didn't it didn't mean anything to him right and end so he just remain peaceful entire time and you see the way Bob what time do the way of the whole story
 plays out is that Duchess world collapses and he becomes he has his head cut off his first of all publicly his daughter his beloved beautiful daughter reject him
 and then
cuz you you're you're the resentment said you bear to his my husband they discussed me so much that I just can't bear the thought of having anything to do with you and she she's like voluntarily like
 what's the word like a light source elf up you know like she sells for emulated Mary got to be until 9 or loaded self-immolated and that's set off like a whole wild senior all Lord shiva's followers just start attacking and Ducks his head is cut off and sometimes that happens it was like it wasn't coming off at first it is he heading happens in and then he and then at the end you know he has it had replaced by a goat's head and then he has to go back in the bag more rare than he has to go and beg you and there's other places were injured a lot of times as the person is Burden Burden with material desires burdened with mundane concerns burn with with
thoughts of his power losing power and all of this in it to wait here we see a lot he's got no birds or even though his situation is very difficult he's lied hard. How do I how do I get it we could we got it I'm not that I've been working on this for like 35 years I'm still not that it seems like and what do I have to take a birth again to become peaceful
 is it working
 if you just need to listen more but in today's today's what you know we got to the point where there is this incredible scene this is one of the most graphic dramatic scenes in Baba Town may be the most dramatic scene in Trinidad appears this you know the whole scene
Azam it's thrilling it's exhilarating it's terrifying it's satisfying it's it's like it's a it's a blend of emotions going on here you know there's a lot you know there's a lot going on just the form the sound when that sound when he came out of the pillar when it everybody heard that crack
 it just you know how you have sometimes that feeling like when your heart stops beating you know like if you ever had your chest on your stuff you know imagine just physically what that felt like when everybody heard that sound like no one is ever heard a sound like that before the Thunderclap can be can really shake people up with this was like and and then he bust out of that pillar and then he's just malls around me cuz she put you know he just see Slaughters them you know it and it's like terrifying and everybody in that
has a different
 state of mind or difference you could say state of heart summer more burdensome or less burdened
 we're going to hear today there's one prayer from like a whole long list is kind of like a lineup of of of people that were there to witness it and sometimes by what time does this it's something happened in that in that duction Pastime when they all they all beg forgiveness from the chew and then Lord Vishnu comes and then everybody one after the other offers a prayer to Lord Vishnu and you can see the different mentalities and I think that's what Bob time is doing you know intentionally it's like it's lining up different people that have different burdens or different concerns and we're hearing how they relate to Vishnu and then the next chapter we hear Heather.
everybody here gets one verse in the next chapter prologue it's 43 verses where we hear the expression of the pure devoted entirely unworthy person and it's an interesting chapter I want to share one more thing I was saying about the heaviest Burns week that we carry are the thoughts in her head I was thinking that the entire yoga system that you know everybody sort of interested in eastern thought right now it's a very popular popular practice and there so many practices to unburden the Mind Haitian gazing just looking at one point Focus your mind or anything any point any object even the yoga system cell part of your arm is always to sort of unburned in the mind and they work and they work cuz you can do them and you can feel like now I feel good you do some deep breathing or do a home
a nap Ronnie I'm starting to feel like I'm now I feel good but it's only bhakti where you're fully engaging all your senses all the time
 that you're actually you're fully unburdening the mind because that mine is no no longer can be filled with worry it can be filled with how can I see or if he's worried it's your worry of has served the Lord because the scores of the mindfulness isn't just to be peaceful life is not just to be peaceful the goal in life is to be deeply in love as source and that's where we're going with all the mindfulness who cares if I mindful but I'm sort of you could be mine could write really minded people like down to details of my evil right we don't want to just be mindful and thoughtful and present we want to be God conscious and so boxes away from gauging all of it all of a sudden all the
nice
 how are you ready to get in there I am the mosquito what time witches are very means of Conquest when should I expect the base and see is to the Supreme Lord Narayan on Turner and reshoot the super most human being and two others are spotty the goddess of learning disability office today the author messed up how you should address you need somebody by regular classes in the Bog of Tom and by rendering service a devotees All the Troubles of the Haro become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with Transit Dental songs will be established as in a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are old
drive to the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet reading for the shoe my bag of Tom Canto 7 chapter 8
 text 40 so everybody know what I'm going to autocorrect right here I read those really mechanically oh my God I don't want to do it all again but I'm just going to just put it forward for tomorrow is a problem with this something important about doing the same thing everyday right when we chant all mantras in our chantar Joppa when you if you sing Bhajan there's something important about doing it every day you get perfect practice makes perfect Robinwood everyday is you can get mechanical you can get wrote
 I was thinking when I think we we get too accustomed to it and you know like when we say that like it's a home against the Run
now it's is home
 if you're meant to vibrate that sound not just like Zip over right so you can't look down and taking it like at least a little something any Sanskrit scholar would be crying when they hear me chant that but if we do just that and just send the only we slow down then it's likely will be good throughout the rest of the money okay that's good that's a good one I get it it's good cartoon Out imagine this picture
right we just everybody just witness the most violent but beautiful scene and then everybody danced and sang and flowers are coming down and drums are beating and the whole thing and now like everything settled a bit and now Lord Vishnu in this terrifying form just his main is covered in blood and he was very beautiful yeah I seen interesting when you see a bad guy got killed in the blooding like somehow like it's all just made him still more beautiful like the blood on his main and all that yeah and
 and now it's like he's sitting on the throne and people are approaching but he's too hot it's like that cuz at the end of this I think it's over Mama's going to turn to a Pro logic
first Lakshmi can you go and you know you're his Divine consort you know he's too hot right now can you go and cooling down and she can't and then finally for my turn to Providence has provided it's only you eating for you you go and you speak to but everybody's going to offer prayer here but he's kind of like almost like still like seething on that on that Throne you know
 it's so angry
 that is the volume is being mistreated Merry Christmas
 all right ready here is Lord Shiva and Indra kind of the book kind of a big 3 is the VIPs yeah and and you don't git g i d is very important demigods vermaas very pure he's you know he's a great Sage you know not he's not just a demigod but he's like he's he's kind of the senior
host and no one's number wisdom and Lord Shiva he's he's like if anything more pure he's practically Vishnu he was he's practically this new yeah and the ninja is another category
 you know now it's kind of you know like he is like one of us in a sense just in a particular post right he's an incredibly special Soul amongst all the souls in the one of us except better and every possible but but he has the struggles you know of a of a material list as mixed Blended
 with his your devotion and so these are for the first day of very interesting prayers this is lorber Mob a number one son and you possessed unending potencies no one can estimate or calculate your prowess and wonderful influence for your actions are never polluted by the material energy through the material qualities
very very easily create the universe maintain it and again annihilate it yet you remain the same without deterioration my back it's no big deal creating a universe is like oh no problems
 I therefore offer my respectful of basin season to you so so couple of things here right
 promise not sink as many of the other people that come later than to say they have their own individual concern and they say you just solve the problem for me thank you yeah right Vermont sunset from a 6-person wonder what we're talking about how do we become unburdened
 dimash doing right here cuz he gets a lot of respect a lot of reputation is built on being the Creator but here he's actually
adding that over I'm not actually the Creator you're the Creator and when I so-called create
 if I become depleted right where is you create unlimited Lee and remain entirely on depleted you there's no deterioration in you how in the world did you do that I offer my bass insist to you in any other commentators are saying that vermaas kind of also expressing Wonder
 like who can understand this Lila the devotee became a demon right like the demon who are in a cashew Pooh was you know one of Johnny or Vijay born in the demon family the demon became the devotee and then he kills his devoted that became the demon he saves the demon the begin to devoti you know in The Most Wonderful Life
demons that are just happy being demons like not a lot of the body that became a demon or anybody just like now I'm staying at the house right like she says you know what everybody's ability is everybody that you know the constitutionally a ghost of Pasha they're probably devotees deep down underneath at all isn't that our theory that everybody is every soul is pure but for Lifetime and I can I can understand this and sometimes probably will say things like eternally Nikki Abundant Life eternally bound up it's as if lifetimes of bad choices whenever those kind of terms of use proper
 carefully points out that that means since time immemorial like just so long as you know I was in that category of lifetime's a badge
when you get here on the material realm there is time doesn't operate in the same way so you're either situated in a situation of eternal
 this or Eternal that and then you flip it you know
 how do you flip it you that you flip it because a devotee comes into your life somehow it offers all you or someone someone is tagged some great Soul has tagged somebody to enter into your life and pull you right out of that Nikki abunda that eternally bound condition amazing if you look back at all or Alive somehow there's been a hand that's reached in and grabbed this private caller oldest out in like maybe turn this around slapped Us in the face a little wake up wake up and then just left here we are on Zoom talking about it
 all right let's continue on now this looks like even now Lord Shiva he's going to say something the end of the millennium
is the time for your anger
 now that this insignificant demon tehrani cashew Pooh has been killed right he was most be most significant in the material universe is so insignificant oh my Lord who are naturally affectionate to your devotee Kylie protect his son prologue Maharaj who is standing nearby as you're fully surrendered devotee now this is interesting to heat has just did the same thing Vermont did cuz he's known for playing his role of manifesting a Divine sort of anger in order to annihilate the universe at the end of its time
 write like no one can do that like Shiva
 but he sang actually when I do that when you it's your empowerment Within Me
 that does it
it's not my power of anger that destroys universe is actually yours her at the end of at the end of the Millennium the end of the Millennium is the time for your anger although he's the one that actually does it I should have got it but he's saying it's really you working through me when we see great personalities with humility
 it just is quite inspiring him in his own burden track and in because his own burden what is he made space for in his own mind and heart he's got Total Space to to to be concerned about what's most pleasing anything super loud, protect his son for a lot who's standing nearby as you're fully surrounded him he's pointing at all here's the here's the person who it's all about you really you're huffing and puffing and angry right now but please you know be affectionate to your to your beautiful the right others do not thinking
you just fixed everything it was a real mess before you came along and do you know messed up like we're going to see Android interest his prayers like it's very to me is maybe the most interesting because it's a blend of so many things you know what you got understand my concern was also going through hell with running a shih-poo yeah this whole list of people now they were going through hell but I guess not so much and Brahma and Shiva we're not going through so much weight is there dealing with it injures the number one son here who was went through hell because of her anytime she poo okay let's see what he says oh Supreme Lord you are the our deliverer and protect her our shares of sacrifice which were actually yours have been recovered from the demon by you
 can a raccoon get into it because the demoniac came around you cuz you play with me
Pearson our hearts which are your permanent Abode were all taken over by him yes that that's very interested in taking over but also can be taking over our minds become burdened Now by your presents the Gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated oh lord for those who always engage in your service which is more exalted than liberate which is more exalted The Liberation all material opulence is insignificant let me read that again oh lord for those who are always engaged in your service this is bhakti Yoga which is more exalted than Liberation this is multi all material opulence is insignificant
 they do not even care for Liberation the devotees not to speak of other benefits of the material world like, getting your desires mixed your Arts at your work in this world and Dharma
 so
he said he said three things here
 and it's it's just such a blend he's a person that's like he's a devotee but he has materialistic concerns still burning in his heart you know so the first thing he says is he speaks to the side you let her know cuz she poo head screwed something up the whole Universal order he messed with it the day it was or supposed to receive shares of sacrifice there's a there's like a some kind of universal order some kind of universal system
 right where the Davis take up huge responsibility
 and the Dharma that's laid out is that you know we human beings are meant to make offerings to them and somehow they enjoy those offering somehow they benefit and enjoy those offerings and her Renny koshy Pooh wanted to upset the dharmic system break it down and make it all about him
 and so they were
so so the pleasures are enjoyments that injury was due
 had been I had been cut off
 and now Vishnu in the form of of machine David just restored that he's grateful for that he's expressing his gratitude you just made my material like better thank you for that
 an invitation says some of this more devotional right you don't hear Shiva saying I have this in this darkness in my heart because of her run Akashi Pooh cuz he unburdened but but but I was feeling such a burden because of her when you catch tapu and he said that place in my heart that I reserved for you he took it over and I couldn't think of you I couldn't feel for you because my mind my heart was completely burned by thoughts of this horrible.
now I feel relief that you're sitting in my heart now that's a place that's meant for you that's your Abode and now your restore there it's a very interesting prayer it's it's it's devotional
 but it's also just showing that he's he's vulnerable his his devoted his vulnerable to external us and this is another simple the symptom of Baca think of the other day that the fever of anxiety starts to diminish until this point where you are pretty undisturbed but I'm saying this in a genuine way I get worked up still but at the same time if I look back in retrospect to where I was coming from exponentially more I saw it in that photograph burden I think I think you're a little burden back then for a little bit burdened and where was the burden it wasn't in my material situation was just
material are mine it was in the mind a little so that that the world Works in progress people this works you got to work it and we'll work some progress so now he did three things he he he he thanked and appreciated Vishnu for restoring you know I'm getting my shares of the sacrifice again and saying really they belong to you
 can I enjoy them although they really belong to you I enjoy them that's now I'm eating it and then he says and then you your presence has relieved me of this Doom and Gloom I was burdened with thoughts of the demon and now you're back in my mind and heart and that feels good and then he laments in a sense that you know you're cured of all these aren't burdened with selfish desires like me. Those who are always engaged in your service which is more exalted than liberation
all material Oculus to them as insignificant they don't even care for Liberation their own burdens with the desire for material things are burned by the desire for Liberation I wish I was like that yeah I'm not like that here I am I'm burdened with wanting power wanting opulence wanting to share with my sacrifices all these things you know
 so that it's so very mixed prayer okay now we hear about the Reese's
 interesting characters all the saintly persons present offered their prayers in this in this way
 Rishi is like a sage oh Lord oh so pretty maintainer of those shelter at your Lotus feet no personality of godhead
 the process of austerity and Penance in which you instructed us before is the spiritual power of your very self
 it is by austerity that you create this material world which lies dormant within you this austerity
almost stopped by the activities of this demon but now by yourself appearing in the form of their string the Dave which is meant just to give us protection and by killing this demon you have again proved the process of austerity
 that's the strength of the Reese's is there Annunciation of this world and to get because of it they develop some spiritual Acumen or even just take the rec practices of austerity right and sitting in this place I do so it said that they were concerned about this you know what's the first words in the universe
 you know when a male you know he was is born on the Lotus he's looking around trying to fight it's all dark he's trying to find what's the origin of the lotus that I'm sitting on it climbs down the stem and he doesn't find anything goes back up and then here is two syllables tapa and insult
he he performs to Pasha and then he's through that it brought about his creative power
 and is lucid spiritual thought and the Reese's follow in the footsteps of her mama right there like through that we recognize the work and how the universe works by Lord Vishnu desire there's a connection between the practice of austerity
 as you mentioned is kind of like you said it's the wealth of the Brahmin is right because through what they develop creative power and Lucid thought and her Renny koshy Pooh came and shut it down and I didn't want their creative power he didn't want their Lucid thought he wanted just all attention focused on him
 and now that's all they were stored there's a property rights in the commentary said all the saintly persons the Reese's who are generally engaged in austerity felt relieved when her running car shipping was killed by the
in the form of Nutrena Dave they realize that the original instruction concerning human life interests are at the original instruction concerning humans are meant they realize that the original instruction concerning human life that is meant for to Pasha or for self-realization was reaffirmed by the Lord when he killed her any type of police there like our world was the practice of austerity for the purpose of self-realization we got this clear thinking through it and he just messed up the whole heart that was our world and now it's back again you know they are happy doing the rest areas again
 all right so these are now they picked the inhabitants of Pick-3 Loca are going to offer their prayers so what is the meaning for that having to planet of the forefathers of his forefathers hid their what are they concerned about right there on this higher Planet what is what is it in their heart
 that an eccentric is a burdensome
respectful of bass in season 2 lord of the maintainer of Dharma religious principles of the universe has killed her any cashew Pooh the demon who by force enjoyed all the offerings of the shroud of Ceremonies performed by our sons and grandsons on the anniversaries of our death and who drank the water with the sesame seeds with what flavor in there we offered in the
 awkward and holy place is a pilgrimage so this is what traditional Hindu rituals is when you the day of the birthday of the ER the anniversary of the death of performers call shradha ceremony where you make offerings to the to the pick threes do that to your ancestors and to appease them onto the give give them blessings and is generally done by the sons of the grandsons by killing this demon oh Lord you have taken back all this
stolen property from his abdomen by piercing it with your nails through poetic if he had digested all of their offerings ever do to them
 we therefore wish to offer a respectful of base and she's on to you so so
 let's try to understand this you know
 it's saying that if we go to the betas
 you which are ancient texts and really had to do with getting people beat to be more pies right more Suffolk you want enjoy we can help you enjoy but we're going to do it in a way that's more refined in an army with the Gods in the goddesses and in Harmony Ultimate with God it'll be happy healthy way for you to pursue materialism rather than very unhealthy ways that were prone to so then they say okay we're going to tell you how are things worth it if you carefully trained your children
 to be good Pious religious dharmic people
then they will imbibe that from you and then when you die they can maintain it through their offerings
 Truth by then continued ritual ritual which is infused with thoughts of Lord Vishnu and acts of selflessness and so on
 that by performing a ritual. You will be maintained on a higher planet and they know that and so it kind of obliges the Next Generation to take up the same rituals the same healthy rituals as the previous generation and then they're they're concerned about their place that it be maintained
 and so they pass that on to their kids and you create this chain of of of Dharma in a sense right so the pictures of like we're straight on this hyar planet but who
who is messing up the whole thing he's like just do to him we may lose this position and then Lord Lord Vishnu comes re-establish is it on the same thank you thanks to you you know he was taking all of those offerings for himself now there's hope for us that we can be maintained that the the dharmic order has been restored
 okay this is now from coming from Sid hello cuz it's a plan of the perfected beings Yogi's mystical Yoder Stingley what do they do out there on the whole time do Mystic yoga
 respond I mean is it just peaceful is it funds Scotty peaceful peaceful Christ was in it from cineloka everything like that like one of these people from Christ were going to say that he had Saint Peter Saint Peter where is he go to the Loca
send a logo that's like I haven't did you like a heaven to go to sit a local would be like what the Christians described as a heaven right probably he goes if his concentration was on Jesus so go to Jesus
 yeah, probably one say that
 Jesus has his own planet
 not sure maybe I could imagine that Jesus loves Jesus loca loca you choose a very nice yeah I bet there's a blue daloka perhaps
 two so far as a regular lizard Loca I was really worried about lizards people yesterday and snake people test what was the burden or what was the concern when they get up to pray What did the what do the nagas pray about
 algerie
they're always worried about Garuda eating than Garuda it wasn't weasels who else kill snakes will find out tomorrow what the nagas was concerned about beyond the edge of my seat Alara to shingle a shithouse learning she got it because we belong to sit hello, we automatically achieve perfection in all eight kinds of mystical power that is awesome
 tell Faith that kind of attitude. That'll get you to cineloka but it won't get you to go Loca if you think it's a while that is all it is awesome it is an awesome guy Christ pull that always anytime anyway he did it used it yet because you poop was so dishonest that by now a strength of his power and austerity he took away our powers they didn't have any other cities to put away sitting on that planet without cities like this
the water has fallen out of his Mystic strength now because of this Rogue this rug has been killed by your nails we offer respectful of base and see is unto you it is kind of like everybody sees their their own desire in a sense right it's like we didn't have our Mystic Powers because of him you've restored that thank you
 the inhabitants of video Adara did the aadhaar Loca prayed are acquiring power to appear and disappear in various ways according to varieties of meditation was banned by that foolish runny cashew Pooh because of his pride in his Superior bodily strength and his ability to conquer others this is almost like you know 1989 when the Berlin Wall
and everyone's like they're free they couldn't practice religion and religious Bob like everything through the Eastern Europe and this is sort of like ding dong the witch is dead and everyone that you feel right
 sister did this this video again you said yes already. Hara knowledge but where do they get the knowledge they get it through meditation so they got knowledge Mystic knowledge through meditation and her any type of said no more Mystic meditation so they're happy at a time unless you want to find out if initially the pit I didn't finish this now and now the screen person I've got head was killed has killed him just as if the demon were an animal on to that Supreme Pastime or the Lord is strong and able to return Ali offer respectful of agencies to you
the way that we can hold till Sunday at 7 a.m.
 and you're not going to find out what happened to the nagas till Monday until Monday if people have questions they can email us that with some of the sages 108 at gmail.com you got that people send your questions in Ross we're going to just put it all on bunke funky many questions from you but still sending me okay no enemy centered people do it don't do it hate and resentment are our biggest burdens and I'm around big bag of rocks big bag of rocks around your neck like a
 like a person with a big bag of roster
isn't there like a bird that carries
 donkey know this is the word I'm thinking of someone else I'm talking about stork with a big bag of rocks are hard place albatross
 yeah Albatross thank you Kylie has a bag of rocks it's just has a hard time getting off the ground with you right now there's a story behind ahead
 beheading happens if your burden with resentment beheading happens I turn it off we don't want to just be mindful we want to fall deeply in love with God
 the albatross is sometimes used metaphorically to mean a psychological burden most often associated with guilt or shame
 it is okay why though
home Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Albatross policy ship setting out to see which is considered a sign of good luck however the ticular Mariner shoots the albatross with the crossbow and act that will curse the ship and cause it to suffer terrible mishaps don't shoot the albatross by Albatross unable to speak to the lack of water the ship's crew let the Mariner know through their glances at they blame him for their plight and they tie the bird around his neck they tired of bird around though cuz it had a burger on his day okay I something like that as a sign of his guilt okay
 again
 continue on the Big Bird
 Albatross I think I got the biggest longest wingspan yeah remember the episode we did on that crazy bird from New Zealand
how do you spell practice daily but don't make a mechanical rant great personalities with humility have space for thinking of the devotees dissipate the Gloom in our hearts yeah
 forgot to Yogi's material opulence insignificant little significant but get hiranyakashipu is dead
