 live from a soupy house in Bosnia this is wisdom of the sages a daily spiritual podcast that makes ancient wisdom relevant today I'm sure I can a pleco host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York City stupid ass welcome to the show is episode 1351 Welcome to our
 very focused study of the stream oddbods what time you're joking this morning cuz to her saying well you don't like what I say or you are just weird
turn around here going through the bottom of time to study for some of us has a study we're studying deeply the bog would stop talking about it
 I'm planning it when I objected that I'm not denying that there's any truth in it I'm just saying that when you're communicating you know by giving something a tagline Mia you it you're trying to give an impression of what's going on inside of you say study like remember when we were kids you wake up early in the morning on Saturday to watch the cartoons but you woke up too early they had like walking the national anthem be like welcome to Sunrise semester flag with the national anthem at going on forever or just or just this like
 cuz I got to own yes so my point being that it people might get the wrong impression by bike
Captain would feel like you know what I'm studying this morning waking up early to study some people might give them a little boost the taglines got to have a broader appeal that's my I guess what we are at a shoulder rent a breathtaking place in the mountains at a sushi house
 you know in this stupid house is like an ashram old Oscar I'm here they built into the mountains and it would this cave with this beautiful River coming out of a cave beautiful all the kids are now taking a boat into that game right now I have Amor Amor introduce her of course she says and I'm kinda is going to explain Sufism in a nutshell in one minute I'm going to another did you know that I did he's got that trauma plays he's got that suit be drawn here you go to our culture and I appreciate it he is a nut
from Bosnia from from you're an excellent glad to say that but go ahead and I'm like I said Thank You, sugie good morning everyone I'm sorry that that you cannot show really this place all of you but too short it's a Sufism is the esoteric aspect of Islam which river wanted to go much deeper than just the promises of Heaven you do good and song they didn't want to trade with God they wanted to love God and love of God that's why even you can see heater they took refuge in this amazing part of the nature just depends are spiritual practices which is very similar to watch novicium a lot in Sufism always a chanting praying dancing dancing which is representing
when you meet the Lord when your heart get a venue experience Ecstasy of date of the Divine love you start to see the children the spinning out of them out of love out of Freedom that would have whirling dervishes and this is the place we stayed under the spirituality because they believe that there is much things higher than the promises was there which is about a selfless service love of God I'm actually going to order very very known motor of the sufis amps is to be bigger in this world to be a bad guy to be a beggar that's like a goal in there
 in the kingdom of God video with the mood like a bigger like I'm empty-handed please accept me please engagement
why you become a devotee you probably already had it very good question it took me a while to feel am I betraying my so to say culture family but then I figured it out that actually it was a very deep conviction and confirmation I received that actually it was
 their blessing brought me to download Eros School Coco by Chanel the same to bring me further even in my spiritual life and I felt even my appreciation for Sufism even grew more feel the same way about Jesus yes thank you Martin and thank you very much that was good thank you all right

 yeah
 thank you thank you alright let's get on with all this week or nuggets have not been just normal ordinary quotes we've been kind of reaching into current events in newspaper articles and things like that
 will continue with that Trend today
yeah this is from the BBC from the PVC this isn't conscious a joke are you exactly right it's are you kidding me I really that's where we're at is 2024 you asking animals are conscious they're catching up it's like they don't even have the words to describe it is so easy to weigh be explained it to live. Just go down for a second so this is a BBC article that was published on June 15th 2024 so just a couple weeks ago
 and was written by a polyp gosh who's the BBC science correspondent OK Google come on Charles Darwin
what do you want me to do I'll do what's a long article so okay you got to say my lights and maybe I should just be parts of it but we can write started
 call me when you go Sir Charles he writes a polyp ghost rights Charles Darwin and joys in your god-like status among scientists for his theory of evolution
 but his ideas
 that animals are conscious in the same way humans are have long been shunned until now or maybe shown by some people that really got their heads, play everything we've been always saying for thousands of years cuz I've been saying it for thousands of years now they're like but now we realize breathing's importance now approaching is important but let's get moved out a lot to read her the right answer but you're right I'm with you he says there is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pain feel Pleasure and Pain
misery Darwin wrote but his suggestion that animals think and feel was seeing a scientific heresy among many if not most animal behavior experts I'm sorry a child can tell you that animals feel in our conscious attributing Consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin it will that's the point right is used got your like religion here that you call like modern science but it's it's so much of it is ridiculously faith-based
 the argument went that projecting human traits feelings and behaviors onto animals that's the way that they use language for you're projecting this on to that note we're just observing the argument with a projecting human traits feelings and behaviors onto animals had no scientific basis
 no it's called common sense and there was no
way out of test and there's no way of testing what goes on in animals might as well you know what there's no way for me to test what's going on in any other human beings mind
 you know if new evidence emerges of animals ability to feel and process what is going on around them could that mean that they are in fact conch
 now here's going to this is where thing this is where they believe they're even having this conversation it's get ready for your BS detector to like start going off he continues we know that bees can count recognize human faces and learn how to use tools so the same because we're discovering these things maybe they're conscious Professor Lars shipka
 of Queen Mary University of London has worked on many of the major studies of be intelligence I just want to focus on
if bees are that intelligent this is what he is he saying Professor Lars if bees are that intelligence maybe they can think and feel something which are the building blocks
 of Consciousness he says hold it slow down hold the phone you are a him to slow down but I told me to slow down appropriately directed slow down Professor you are professor at a Queen Mary University and you are to work so hard to get that title using the building blocks of Consciousness now hold it what if you're going to go and throw out of a term like that then tell me exactly what are the building blocks and then go into a laboratory and build some Consciousness for me put the whole ideas for
thousands of years going back to the Upon A shots
 the sage is a major dendias said that Consciousness is something that's irreducible there are no building blocks something is either composed of material energy and is in sentient and temporary and its form or something is made of spiritual energy which means that its Eternal and conscious by Nature that just open up your Bhagavad Gita Professor Ghosh and its it tells you right there for thousands years and it continues to hold up that Consciousness is irreducible it can't be cut it can't be you know you don't build it or break it down if it's spiritual energies conscious by Nature we've got thousands a years and although and although you're so resistant to hear this because it just throws your whole thing and in disarray yes it does a child can look at an animal and know that it has feelings anyone can tell
search don't they what do they think about like the animals who've famously saved lives from dogs to sea turtles to horses
 it said that nothing could be more okay let's continue Professor chika's experiments show that bees would modify their behavior following a traumatic incident and seemed to be able to play rolling small wooden balls that he says they appear to enjoy as an activities kind of a dog I know these results have persuaded one of the most influential and respected scientist and animal research to make this strong Stark and contentious statement giving all the evidence that is on the table
 it is very likely that these are conscious that dogs may be Man's Best Friend it isn't just be
 many say that it is now time to think again with the emergence of new evidence
they say that a sea change in thinking on the signs of animal Consciousness didn't you know really what's going on here rocking out the way that I see is yeah it is if you go back 50 years the scientists were saying we're going to create Consciousness in the laboratory and you come back fifty years later and they haven't moved forward sesame seed one big step yeah and so now they're just trying to like kind of play with it and say what we could not always say that Consciousness is in his animals in their building blocks that built it up for the animal to it's it's simple you know that the stages of ancient India these in these ancient Texas has where you see birth growth reproduction and maintenance for sometime you know when filing joint disease and ultimately death that mean I'm at the window right now we're doing nothing but but that means that there's a spark of spiritual energy within the material energy
that's making a go through those patterns and we see it hey hey mr. Ghosh it's not only animals at the plants as well all right you may as well go ahead and take the big leap okay take a crazy week ahead pine trees are alive this is you know and and what you know they're going to be going to talk about conscience this Sunday for level it isn't just be easier to send it this is CJ we have this is Professor Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics we have researchers from different fields starting to dare to ask questions about animal Consciousness and explicitly think about how their research might be relevant to those questions
 anyone looking for Eureka moment will be disappointed because you can't find it with your material with your material instruments we've been saying that all instead of steady growth of evidence for rethink has led to murmurings among researchers involved now
anyone see what it want a change in scientific thinking what they're saying is the stages of ancient India said look you're not going to be able to find it with material instruments you're not going to be able to receive Spirit directly with your eyes you have to infer it by looking into nature and and it and it observing its patterns now they're saying in the pastor say that can't be accepted there's no scientific evidence so it's all false now what they're saying is will actually we're applying a little influence here
 yeah thank you you know yeah that's why they won't be a Eureka moment and now it's like there is an excavator a backhoe or a riding mower a Porsche in a school bus all different vehicles and they all have different capabilities strengths weaknesses right and there's a different driver the drivers are pretty much the same some guy gets into each vehicle now that driver
this whole vehicle that can do a certain thing the Porsche can go fast the excavator can dig holes the school bus can carry many people the bodies are different it's such a simple simple matter fact you ask anybody's ever heard of Krishna Consciousness even if they can't follow the principles are they they're attached to the material world they will also you know what the philosophy is just so damn sad unless you're bent unless you know unless you're somehow motivated whether it's a psychological disposition whether he got sacked at your people to your own particular religion or you're being funded you know and Emma did this goes against all of your previous research has discovered may not amount to conclusive proof of animal Consciousness but taken together
 it is enough to suggest that there is a realistic possibility that animals are capable of Consciousness according to Professor Birch the supply
not only to what are known as higher animals such as apes and dolphins have reached a more advanced stage of development than other animals it also applies to simpler creatures such as snakes octopuses crabs bees and possibly even snakes your life reflect their life they feel according to a group who want funding for more research to determine whether an hangout a job and if so to what in all this money going to school and we need a job Yes or No Deal why not be honest Professor go shoot you who is probably spend your entire life trying to deny what your forefathers have been put forward why not say you know the stages of ancient Indian in books like to punish odds in the bug of agita and the Piranhas they've said forever they had a theory that they put forward that Consciousness is a symptom of a spark of spiritual energy
 according to the different bodies that that's park is in it can man
it's its ability to express its Consciousness is expanded or reduced but wherever we see life that is good that that it is fundamentally conscious Consciousness is no proper and this one I appreciate so much will probably probably came to America in the in the age were these different Swami's were coming over and for the most part they were speaking in terms of you know they're talking about meditation and becoming deeper you realize prop had went right to the fundamentally said look it all starts with understanding that we're not these bodies that the body is just made of material energy which is in sentient and but we are a spark of Consciousness energy were conscious by Nature our Consciousness spreads throughout our body and it in conscious to end life comes from life and you can and he would say
 he would challenge him say he would say don't accept a post-dated check the same we're going to
Consciousness in the laboratory they still can't do it just have another nature then they get into stuff like they start saying
 summer critical some summer very critical
 of some uses of the word consciousness
 quote the field is replete with weasel words and unfortunately one of those is consciousness says Professor Steven harned of Quebec University it is a word that is confidently used by a lot of people but they all mean something different and so does not clear what it all means no that means your your bluff is getting called and now you're saying it's just all the question of semantics but just open up a freaking dictionary and look up the work now could you please give us the definition of the word conscious
 Consciousness is the quality or state of being aware especially if something within oneself
volition and thought so you go do you think does it doesn't animal feel does it think is it a where you think a dog's not aware you can train it to do all kind of things how many grams do you need to give me crap you do you give the charger right to the message where you guys pull out under swamy said that 70 years ago the scientist in a long and expensive research to find out why spiders build webs after long research and lots of money they concluded they do it to catch flies this Professor Stephen Harbin after is like saying oh it will really you know what the word Consciousness means it's really the problem he says that a better less weaselly word as sentients which is more tightly defined as the capacity to feel did you have a definition of word sentient as
 feeling conscious of or responsive to the sensations of seeing hearing feeling tasting or smelling
today so hot hot on your Wikipedia though for you so Professor 100 yeah it was conscious and Santino essentially the same thing can it feel Kenneth thing is it where I would like an article like do they go to dog heaven the dogs go to dog heaven or not I like that should that that should be the question you should be asking so anyway it's like you've got to be trying hard to convince yourself that animals are not conscious you you don't even understand why we have such a better explanation do we have to think of everything cuz scuba so professor professor goes you're a writer goes through or whatever he should be saying in this article that for thousands of years a tradition that continues to this day has been denied part of that I was born into such a good part of that spit all over in probably not yet but but that that it is said all along that Consciousness is the ear
reducible symptom of spirit of spiritual energy of a book of the Optima right and ends and these awesome and if and if that's true
 then these scientists are just like absurdly behind you know behind the behind the game here and then just to even question or animals conscious it just means you have no common sense and you're trying to objectify life where is it because people send same thing about women they have no souls you know do you know Africans they have no souls you know it's just like that's it's that kind of ridiculous yes absurd conclusions that you use when you want to check defy and oppress women do have souls by the way thank you okay with this

 Chewbacca Tom Canto 7 chapter 11 text
 13 the same one we have finished getting all worked up yesterday I was going to worked up camera why but something was if you had to do her way to bring it up don't bring it up okay I'm going to remember it had to do with whether we should meditate on Christmas Past Times or apply knowledge to the world that we live
 okay and you to steer these 33 about what makes a person who has a human body civilize what makes them is it just to get a bodily then they're human and then we say no it's the discipline
that go with getting a body just like if I put a three-year-old in a car does that mean they're a car driver know they have a car but it doesn't mean they can actually perform a function on the road responsibly with the parallel park the car it just cuz we got a body doesn't qualify as to be human if they act in a certain way and we went through all these things like regulating your senses being truthful honest and then also needs more refined ones like regular studying of the
 but regular studying of the owner's manual right here in sacred literature hearing Direction instead of blah blah blah blah blah supersilent I got to pinch her to get her to say something so you know it and there's a list of 30 of these principles I think 20 or 21 of them
how to do with things that were favorable for bhakti you know and yeah I'm controlling the mind the last one for regards to fold being charitable excetera excetera and then the last 9 or so these are direct practice is about to yoga these are things that are there certain things that can be tied about to yoga and then there's certain things that are you know directly directly hearing about the person that have died chanting about these are enchanting okay so that's where we're at now the last sentence now
 sure she's the last one
 okay maybe not always remembering activities in the instructions trying to render service and we did that for me worship authoring obeisance he's becoming a servant becoming a friend and surrendering one's very self their whole self
running very parallel to Pearl odds instructions about a division of spider that we heard earlier in this Canto okeene you to steer these Thirty qualifications must be fired in the human form of life I love when someone tells me what to do in it in a positive way most people are just wandering around this world lost bumping into things making mistakes here you go you want to become human do this stuff so you can also be coming to Raja dentist okay so you to steer the king is inquiring from Naruto the sage of about these in town are do it for the neck for the rest of this cancerous like five chapters left this is the this is why it doesn't it it's like we get to a point of dissatisfaction and you find someone who's a little wiser than you and say I got some questions I'm in pain and I'm suffering am losing my mind I'm on my knees help me and then God
and the person to give some direction who's Who's got what you Who's got what you want that's where what the guru is the guru's got something that you want and you say how do you get that and that was just the instructions I think it would be cleared these aren't just like I instructions for the individual book these are kind of what we're going to hear now our instructions for the guidance of the broader Society I'd like to do something here when we talk about varnish on Dharma let's be clear
 what it's saying is that these ancient texts are saying that their insights into human psychology and it's in into human life in general that we can look and see that there that Society has different kind of leaders
 people with different aptitudes that can lead in different ways and leaders are really important in society because if you don't have good leadership at all go if there's a lot of suffering that takes place
 so it is
here here in and they know I don't know if you even aware of yet but there's a presidential debate on one hand you have someone that was lying on stopping other hand you had a person that could barely like compose a sentence with Arsenal and it's all because of these party Dynamics you know that that democracy kind of lens itself towards and and what was being said he was that we need to recognize people that have aptitude for leadership
 we need to create ethical codes and and they need to be trained they need to go to school they need to be drained and what it means to lead and what and what are the specific responsibilities that specific types of leaders have and that's
widespread there should be widespread knowledge of what that is so if your business leader it should be clear what your responsibilities are and if you're like a political leader or ruler it should be clear and if your spiritual leader it should be clear and if you don't fit into any of those categories it should also be clear about how you respond to that type of leadership and in this way ideally what you do is it doesn't become a tool of Oppression but it becomes actually the tool to counter oppression and we can talk about that more as we go but they're for you just you as the king and he was very interested in it and in understanding the artist how Nardo understands varnish Under Armour or understanding the four different occupation or you know what three different types of leadership in and then the occupation for those that aren't that type of leader
 and also the four stages of life that we go through and what are responsibilities as a young person as a
person as a retired person or at the very end of life what where where should where in this where should our Consciousness where should I where should our Focus be in these are laid out in a brilliant way that yes like any other good thing can be used as a tool of impression or it can be used as a tool to counter pressure like that
 text 30
 okay text 13 those who have been reforms by the garbage garbage on ceremony and other prescribed Reformatory methods performed Vedic month without interruption and who have been approved by Laura Berman are the diseases or the twice-born such prominence treachery is and vices purify by their family traditions and by their behavior should Worship the Lord study The Vedas and give charity in this system they should follow the principles of the four ashrams brahmacharya crust
Enterprise Encinitas okay so let's break this down those who have been reformed by the garbage on what's the garbage on ceremony that's the birth ceremonies were they civilized
 families that practice from birth ways to engage these kids and control their senses and use their mind apply those 30 principles sometimes I like to share the story that but it just helps us understand India Indian culture which is based off of these Innovative text it to what extent it if it's still vibrant and you know in Indian families you know it will vary but you know that there's a day that they're two rolls around in December every year where call Gita jayanti in you know we celebrate this the day that the buggy to a spoken on ya
and back at the Bronx back in the Broom Broom Street Temple days you know where I was there with that Eastern and we had to attend now they're back at the temples back in the same spot we used to celebrate that every year in the way that we celebrate it was by doing a ritual wherein you create the sacred fire even endorse wrong and we would read the entire bug of agita verse for verse and with each verse they would offer grains and key Into the Fire as an offering to God and he would bring a priest a priest prakash and Indian priest Brahmin
 and Eddie and and the priest would chant those verses and offered Guillen ingrained into the fire with each one and at the end of each and they will go very fast
 and at the end of each chapter I would speak a little bit on the summarize the chapter
 and so what was one year were doing the empress prakash
a little son name for knob and he was like 8 years old but he was already like memorizing whole chapters in The Book of Akita and everything
 and in my explanation of one of the chapters I began to speak about what's being spoken about here and in this verse there's an ID in America the whole the most important principle is freedom right like that's what we we place at the at the top sure the country is founded on freedom hey you can have any religion you cannot be religious you can do whatever you want here you know that's that's an end that value I think is so deeply ingrained in us that it's we don't think about social responsibility first we think about personal freedom first this what we value highest whereas in the Eastern cultures
 there was an idea that you even from your birth you're indebted to your parents since
grandparents into your great-grandparents and so I was saying that if you look at prakash priest prakash he's a barometer right he's a priest and he's a person that he performed rituals for the spiritual benefit of others and his father did that in his grandfather did that and it's likely that they they can go back many many generations
 and it's always been that way that one father has handed it down to his son and the son feels like this may have gone on for a hundred generations and and I don't want to be the person that breaks the chain in other ways our family has embraced this role on behalf of society and we will continue to write from the not even from birth but even garbage on his ceremony even preconception
 we're performing rituals and bring our attention to the idea that we want to bring the dishes what down it was too
but early in the week right bring a soul into our body and I'm ready to go switch to call you don't call for for a soul to take birth
 that will help our family uphold this sacred Duty that we have to society and then so even from the conception what you speak of birth and then you're trained to own that sacred responsibility so here is saying that it mentioned three did the brahmas who are the spiritual leaders the treacherous who are like the political rulers and the prices were the economic the business owners in the employer's that they would be free from early age you could see it in them as well you would invest these strong code of ethics so that that would protect them and protect those that would serve under them from exploitation and cultivate the best qualities in us right so it's saying that that's
that's that's what is born awesome is really all about that that say a business leader gets a deep understanding from early on that my success in business has everything not so much to do with how much money are produced but how well I care for others and care for society you know it's kind of idea first generation of Indians maybe the second word be like you know what we're going to do it our way by preciate all the Traditions going back for a great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather great great great but you know what
 I'm wearing a bikini or what I mean I'm going to do is break the Traditions a lot when you get like that sometimes you to get an Indian in class and I was famous for doing Hands-On assist. Put your hands up
put your hand I see something different your body your body is a little awkward so they'll tell you to bend your knees and push you on the lower back or something like that Indian ladies would be like losing touch me in no one touches me except my husband that's just the way it is and I could get that cuz I was a devotee but I wasn't one person it was many people like that many Indian ladies are like that it just because it's just part of that culture you don't put your hands you're not having multiple partners you're not getting divorce this is your you know that me and my husband and I only want to touch my body but millions of things like that and like this is the first generation we just become so homogenize cultures have become so imagine eyes than the last
 since the information age pretty much that it just collapses and becomes sort of America americanism just like we were in Bosnia this morning and
do some Bosnian at fits of like traditional Bosnian outfits and I was thinking I would love to see once I cross the border every one of these boxing at the Wai is it in the same I'm sick of us setting the standard for what clothing should look like ritual should look like habit she look like it's colonialism still exists and is perpetuated by Hollywood we keep on pushing our thoughts or ideas and cultures around the world and now everyone sort of looks the same access same Banks the same
 I'm sick of it and I'm okay
 can we continue I'm just trying to think about this what would I be wearing an American outfit Italian outfit what I've been wearing them that's the whole point is America was the blend of everything yeah
 anyway
 that's why I like lederhosen
okay let her know you had a South Germany people still wear it
 feel
 well yeah it's you can still find Lederhosen catalogs and I was like good for you I'm power I believe it it yes keep going I'll support you
 text Maxine 14 or brahmana there 6 occupational duties acharya should not accept charity but he may perform the other five of these duties a king horchata Ria is not allowed to Levy taxes on brahmins
 what do you make make a livelihood by levying minimal taxes customs duties and penalty fines upon his other subjects and your interest in ever getting into like rules of running a society now we can have a spiritual topic to run a society but did the whole idea is they're so close to
because if you can run a society in a healthy way is conducive for the spiritual practice of the people yeah so it starts saying there needs to be Brahmin us promise not only can accept charity they would live by charity they're they're not supposed to work a job where they get a paycheck because they're meant to be active put eggs actually accept money from someone who is likely to become influenced by that you should be unemployed finding external financial interest and not and not just like okay we don't get paid we live by charity but you voluntarily
 take about poverty you want to live as simple as you possibly can because once you have a lot of desires then you're like I want more charity give me more charity but it weakens me a real Brahmin want to be soda
that are not dependent on your money you give him some money okay they'll accept it but they're not going to have them on the Brahmin except chair that amount so 6 to tease you want is accepting charity another is giving charity because if they get anything access beyond their minimal needs their messages pass it on pass it on that could not be cooked and that way they can be purchased if there a judge right abdominal be a judge sometimes or doctor even think doctors also have Brahmin is it depends on us and therefore they can be purchased and you know you want out of a doctor
 yeah tell me the doctors who were doing an operation that you don't need not all of them but there are cases where doctor might do an operation because they need to pay off their boat or whatever do with the way that's even broader than that is like the influence of Corporations
and Healthcare right in other words
 the way that that a Vedic thinker would look at our Modern Health industry is there saying that business people people that have business Acumen see the health industry is a place to make a lot of money they look at it as an opportunity right and and then they apply their is their business ideas into the sacred realm of caring for the health of another killing people there's no money in healing people there's money and keeping them sick and so they're saying that that kind of person should not even stick their nose into this Arena
 it should be a person that that that that has no Financial motive which means the political when we think a tree this is
is I think this is the healthiest way to think of it is really hard for us to conceive of what is that mean they're not elected to the post no they're not elected they just take it the all-weather some kind of tie dye ideas it's just that I think that is the easiest way to thing this is think of your in a town in the wild west yeah and you got a population of 100 people and you received the news over the wire that there's like a band of of you know of Outlaws coming into your town right and and you're all looking at each other and you're saying who's going to do something about this women 50% of them were pregnant or have children are just not ready to handle this challenge a terrified by it and there's going to be some men among them to say put the badge on my chest I'm ready to fight
 and in that purse
becomes the ruler now that we're going to say what just of the LeBron is person because it is like with no because this is size same but they need to be they need to accept the direction of the deep spiritual peaceful people but someone's got to step forward and be the manager of society you know what it means when when someone breaks a law someone's got to step forward and say
 I'm dealing justice so you want to be you want to power you want the strength you want the the assertiveness you want to be the Bold one you got to be number two. You want to leave leave the society you want to direct people okay great you got it you can be number one you got to give up everything we're not trying to push intellectuals to being businessman the intellectual that will study the benefits of renunciation
be like yep that makes sense I'm going to naturally give it up and find peace and then I'll be the director I'm just going to give up stuff and you want the stuff that's okay you can either stop you can be have the ego you can have the Bron but you got to be number two you got to be submissive to those with giving up everything that's perfect person the barometer can lead is because people trust them because they can see through their life stuff look at the Simplicity and hear the wisdom that they speak to spend time reading these books all that you know what is another story maybe I'll tell it when we come back that we got a few minutes.
 But I have one friend who's a senior see you know he's a renunciate and a barometer and he wears the clothes of of a you know that the orange close of a of a seniority he was riding on a train United with with two elderly Indian gentleman and will end the year is this
when was the elderly father and the other was like a middle-aged son
 and the son had his arm in a sling
 and my friend said to him how did how did you get injured you know they're all respectful to him naturally Rio you're the Brahmin that you're the senior I see that you know that they naturally should respect that Simplicity in that renunciation and so and so he responded humbly by so it's nothing it's nothing important the father so now you should tell him and and he was resisting saying out to Melody and the end of my personal please tell me so he said well and in this was the story that he was a officer in the Indian military
 and he was driving with his family in his car at night time and they came to a roadblock in the road a military road block and so being a higher ranking officer he said to the person that was setting up the road. He said what happened here and you know the person saluted and said
house over there some terrorists have taken over the house and their hostages in there so he's in the car with his family just driving along out of the ordinary day and he says give me a gun
 right he leaves his family in the car
 and he starts to approach the house and somehow or other he got in a gunfight with the terrorist
 was was shot and injured in in in the course of this and free the hostages so that's arson is a qualified that tree don't some my my friend said then how can you do that like how can you just on a moment's notice put your life at risk pick up a gun and an din din din din you don't put yourself in that kind of danger but people die and don't know you're not going to get me some if they're paying you were giving you a reward of its internal it was his only Studios
that he gave his really profound he said he said swami-ji just like for you reading the sacred text reading bug of agita true about that is your life
 is it for me this is my life you know and others meaning not only smile I found it like that's what I do but it's like this is how I am right this is my nature you know what I see when I see that challenge run away from it I run towards it I have it in me that's the person that supposed to to be the charger and they don't accept charity write their ideas like it's saying how they make money how does the how does the spiritual leader make money they live off the donations of the people how does the the political ruler that this this Dynamic kind of you know protectors that they have the right to Levy taxes they can minimal taxes it says he right they can Levi minimal taxes a I'm going to put my life on the line to protect all of you I'm going to collect
just that we're going to use to to run the society and I'm going to take from that myself a reasonable you know the amount of pay so they can Levi minimal taxes they can create custom duties when people pass through their land trade they have the right to 22 tax that and they also have the right to to find people yo parking tickets in speeding ticket things like that if you break the law we're going to find you through this we're going to create a pool of of of a fund by which we run this town or the city or the nation
 and and and I have the right to live off that but the charts your takes pride and I never accept charity I'm The Giver of Charity and the bug of agita started there where Arjuna has his most important challenge as as a warrior in a protective Society but he breaks down and he says I would rather live by
and like where is this coming from your home or your new title the bhagavad-gita is like simple and so simple to understand you know brother is time all right we got a lot of bring it up there this week
 are bringing Miss Mara who's been really studying here taking lots of notes we stopped all the kids are bored waiting for an hour or so another way to deal with it is that your daily knitting is minimizing your ability to take notes and bring us to take place only reason he thought that I was studying more than usual is because I didn't have my knitting that's what I thought and you're saying he's wrong
