 Alex what's your storage again talk right into the microphone
 everyone
 I am and other I started listening to with some of the sages podcast last October of 2022 I come from my parents were atheist and kind of condemned different forms of religion I am originally from Uzbekistan former Soviet Union satellite stay and I discovered yoga the first time when I was independent going to the university and the United States and was first
go to me was the Asana practice but eventually I got to a point in my life I was already curious about deepening and the research and yoga philosophy and why all of the things that I was doing where I was just feeling better more empowered and then I came to a point where I just a really low point in my life where I realized I was feeling my God shaped hole with a lot of material things with certain festering it was it took so long to realize like I was aching I was festering and then I've got to this realization and just buy a fortune with some of the sages podcast fell into my lap as I was researching and I actually it wasn't in a Reddit post break it giving a list of different yoga podcast and I listen
if you but until I listen to that very first episode I didn't have that realization to want to continue deepening on specifically in back to boxy lineage so since I and yeah I just been listening and I immediately when I go over done eco-village was mentioned it was already in the back of my mind that I wanted to come here and there was a yogi that I was following way before like 4 years I Sarah teacher I don't know if I actually reached out to her cuz when I was thinking about it I saw that she was here for the Long training I reached out to her and I said hey I was just looking at classes care how do you like it and she was kind enough to reach out and tell me about her experiences thank you so much there if you're listening to this so that synchronicity gave me another
 reassuring
that I'm on the right path you send me a knight a really nice Instagram message one time and I said nice person and then you walked into that that she is
 I also felt it was like that was another sign when I saw your post and I like sitting at that you saw my message and that we connected on Instagram so thank you thank you Alex it story
 all right I say we have regular meet the Zoomers while we're here you like that kind of you know why I think it gives a personal ISM to the show that I think it's good to get to know people a good for a community to get to know them and then they meet each other somewhere I know you from the Super Soul it's like oh my God you know our Jimmy James or something like that so it's it's nice
are you in that we back in the Box on time but that we do have a nugget in front to get in to see it did you send me sometimes I loaded up and then I never hit like
 we have a very sad announcement one of our favorite
 characters characters on Seinfeld that's passed away yesterday and Joe d'avola crazy we talked about on a regular basis and everybody's got a crazy Joe d'avola in your life that means you're somebody in their life that might be a little crazy and that may kill you sometimes crumby are best wishes to Crazy Joe d'avola
because they're his
 are people connected in a lot of weight you know you never realized
 sure it was spiritually connected maybe he was spiritually connected as possible, he's definitely spiritually connected and why everybody is sometimes we just don't realize
 all right you want to hear about some of those connected yeah
 Theodora of Alexandria of Alexandria actually went undercover as a male for like a large portion of her life is the male impersonator she was available personator and she went as Theodore
 I'm not going there just yes go
I could tell you the whole long story could you don't know it's just a story okay what you really want to get into it we can just do you want so we can spend some time with me the short version she was saying she was Theodore about st. Theodore shoes called just use what some people refer to as a desert mother
 the desert mother a desert mother in order to adultery she disguised herself as a man and then she joined the monastery
 with men yes they thought she was a man they all thought she was mad
 what about the cuz she was afraid that her husband would find her if she went to a nunnery so she went into the mine
Chris Terry yeah that is not so fast there. You don't know for sure you would have been women in there that you didn't even know
 what if your bathing
 it's okay so so no nobody knew they only found out when she died
 as matter fact shoot she wants was the head of the modest not for heard that it was the other way was anxiety this was like really for them and she was asked to go travel to some other City to purchase some things on behalf of the monastery so the the head of the monitor Center and they said you know there's another monster on the way if you you know if it's night time or whatever you can say that she stayed there in the head of that monitors
daughter tried to just to seduce her thinking she was a him
 getting crazier I know you're going to like the story so she refused but that daughter
 got impregnated by somebody else and blamed him her Theodore
 and then when theater got back to the original Monastery she was being accused of this doing this
 that you must been like oh yeah when she when they when they let her into the monastery first and she was really the whole story of how she got the sheets so she was extremely devout and she was really repentant she actually got pulled into that adultery is a whole story about that
she resisted for a very long time that you got tricked and always blame the woman rice case they did so so she was very repentant and when she got into that monitor she's just in constant deep all the all the monks are very impressed including the head of the monitor so when she was first accused the head of the monasteries that I don't believe that you know Theodore is such a
 Sandy monk but then it got turned around and even that guy didn't believe in any kick it and then they came back with the child gave her the child and said you have to take care of it now and they kick them both out of the monastery she left with the child she left us with a child yes and then she was living as a Hermit raising a child but the other call the local people began to realize what a saint this was do they still think it was a man they all thought it was no one discovered her until she dies and then and then all the local people went back to the monastery after like 7 years or some of that instead you got to let Theodore back in you such a great great scene and then they let him back in
she gave wonderful instructions instructions that Theodore gave to his or her her style Theodore shut herself in her cell with a child and instructed him to love God above all things I was a child I guess maybe I don't know maybe 10 something like that or death I think when I said shut her in a Cell I think that just means I can room I'm not sure so these are instructions love God above all things she told him to Beatty idiomatic that's like that of the monastery and the brethren
 to preserve tranquility
 to be meek and without malice
to avoid obscenity and silliness to love non covetousness to love non-competition love detach attachment and not neglect their communal prayer after this she prayed and for the last time she asked the Lord to forgive her sins
 the child also pray together with her I think she may have been dying of cancer soon the words of prayer faded from her lips on the lips of the ascetic and she peacefully departed to Better World
 Theodore St Searcy right now I really want to hear it now I'm very eager to hear the words of wisdom on the form of a nugget in it
this is good we talked a long time do you live as a spiritual person in the midst of a decadent Society it's a big question that's that's out there yeah you're going to talk about this
 catering catering catering world world working in a bar the workplace any industry is touching him how do you live as a spiritual person in the midst of a decadent Society have your heart always turned towards the Divine have your heart was the instruction have your heart always turned towards the divine
pleasuring him and not in all that is present and distracting before you
 it is not exterior silence that makes you that makes a monk exterior silence that makes him out but Silence of the hearts skipping that mind that the eye on the prize of the mother cow is eating the grass chomping away but it's always got like a third eye watching the calf but now even though it's eating the grass right it's just like you know when you are when I raise my kids in New York City when they're really little you do you go to the park smallpox but in the parents are talking the kids are just running around being kids and even though the parents are talking are expecially New York parents every New York parents got their eye on that kid even though they're not even looking at the kid or just keep an eye out that's cuz you never know I was always like a creepy guy looking up
that's like when you were trying to get Elvis Costello to acknowledge you you had one eye on your kids Wolverine in that Park
 he came to the door with his wife and another person they were really nice yeah we're both throwing down I wouldn't give you the time of day I was cuz I wouldn't budge people are very famous
 play something me alone because it's more like they don't know people some people are like a I love you tell me what my normal
I took back to the thing you know I thought this is a very very useful instruction I had before I was married I had a girlfriend it was I had blond hair and we were invited to that television show in California
 there is a New York state line out and no doubt was performing at Jay Leno so your friends went backstage to see them and then sort of like as a joke
 and I thought I was with like two other guys and as a joke I just started
 the girlfriend look nothing like when Stefani at all except she had blond hair
and so I was just pretending okay right now it's like I was like I had a suit on anyway cuz it sort of just pretending it was her this could go real bad we had so many people following us and then we jump in the car the car was convertible jump in the car and start driving cars of people following us and it was like it was so obvious Gwen Stefani but I played the thing of like sort of bodyguard take a shot take the shot now
 so yeah you get crazy as if they followed us all the way to Culver City
 insane yeah from San Fernando Valley so I'm just saying there are crazies out there there are psycho fans out there just just forgive Elvis Costello on this move on I forgive him
forget my let it go quick back to this nugget yes I think it's really useful. It is kind of like she doesn't say get out of that situation
 you know she doesn't say oh you need to get out of the decadent Society you need to remove yourself from it she's recognized that you may have to operate in it but this the way that she phrases that I think it's important because the fact is we may engage
 with in circumstances that we don't want engage in it we might have to do it a lot but it's not so much the engagement it's where a hard Coast but they when we say hard time in mind is that part of the Mind
 that has to do with your deepest desires or what you hold dearest right and so even though you're moving through that world
 your what's your what's your guarding is your heart but you have to guard that hard for a box of Yogi they have to guard that heart they have to
is my heart's meant for Krishna right I'm not giving it here there and even we give it an all kind of ways give me the heart doesn't just mean like okay we run off with someone or some like that right but it's I kind of like all I desire that I desire that person our desire that Fame and more
 sometimes we say and we recommend how you know what that work place you got to get out of there is bad or extra benefit for being in the midst of it and garlic creating a special snow globe in a snow globe is in Bombay now you don't
 play Drake over around thing and
 can like have likely Enduro some Christmas thing inside of it have you ever seen snow in your life
what's that mean there a television screen so yes it sucks that you got to keep a little snow globe around you and then you're sort of in it but not all of it and if you could pull that off and a lot of our viewers out there it's not like we necessarily live around a particular Temple or a nostrum or Community sometimes our community is just wisdom of the sages you know live from Super soul farming sector that's their community so they become expert at developing what we're talkin about you're not giving out their heart to those engagement complete sense gratification they're reserving some personal Integrity I will say it may not be as fond as having a whole Community dancing and singing together
 but it gives you special strength I think when you can sort of create that protective shield force field yet
even if you're not in the most particular decadent circumstances I still think we need to think this way because it's it it's like
 is if we want to go beyond the superficial in our body then it can't just be like I followed the rules red like externally after we may take great pride or satisfaction in that we follow the external rules but internally there's another conversation going on in the mind of the hearts you know what I want what I wish for her even what I allow my mind to kind of relish a little bit you know what I'm saying and really what it requires is not just an external Fidelity but like completely internal that my heart is dead my heart surgery for God is entirely you know that we have that's that's actually the Divine love that we're looking for so I'm at the way that you phrase that I think she really understood it you know I think that was where she was at and I still say it again she says
and then the way she ended it too is nice so have your heart always turned toward the Divine Right my eyes my ears may be turned towards extra service and hearts always turned towards the Divine find pleasure in him and not in all that is present in distracting before you and then it is not exterior Silence of me I like this one because it says thank you you are to look at my girls are really Gabby I'm very Gabby that doesn't necessarily make you bad evil or not a spiritual person right if you could be silent and in any might appear very thoughtful and introspective that you can be deeply angry deep breathe deeply critical deeply resentful so it's not just the silly silly silly and could be internally
 you could be extremely incredibly silly
internal incredibly sober yes see you again so it's not it's not exterior sounds that makes a month but the Silence of the heart right where my heart is not Gavin with or taking in the desires of the heart Desiring the association know there's a desire for the association with material you know that I think we're all sort of working on and some are sort of like like more treacherous forms of materialism in summer more subtle forms
 but yes somehow we have to get to that point it's challenged enough for us cuz we do we are products of the decadent Society it's it's it's hard enough for us to get the I haven't said it yet how do you know
I know I know what you're thinking I know you're that you don't understand I've got all this stuff going to my head on a regular basis I'm going to say it anyway if you don't mind because not everybody maybe it's in two antennas you are up for us to get our external Behavior harmonious with
 which party is in is a child's University to get together external behavior in line with where where where the real Yogi how real you are about to Yogi that's challenging enough but somehow we got to get to the point where if you turned us inside out
 everything on the inside is also entirely humbleness everything every thought and you know every all of that every internal dialogue every desire that's that's that's the transformation that's the real transformation of the external thing
you know that's wonderful but it's kind of just the beginning and then it becomes a lifetime project to get that internal entirely their you know but that's exciting stuff that we thinking and that's that's the that's the rocket on Project sure the whole story with your son and I think you like it I wonder if I get a thousand years old of New York City
 emasculator on the show quite a few times
 you know you're either you're getting really serious about your spiritual life
time for the Bobby Thompson of course
 I'm headed there right now about what time witches are very means of Conquest Wichita prospective a basin cease to the Supreme Lord the Ryan don't you know and Ryan Ritchie the super most human being today the author not stop and buy rendering service a two bodies all that is troublesome. Heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with trying to get the songs will be established as in a revocable fact
cuz my she would have let you know how I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer my obeisance he's up there let us feed it'll be almost sounded like the what's your name Lakshmi super bottom super Mana m m s subbulakshmi MSU yeah we found it just sounded just like that the the world's greatest carnatic singer all over South India the mistake ignore her
 either she tries to wait no no no she passed away years ago she was a talent what a talent you know what her breakthrough role was
she played Mirror by in a movie like back in the thirties or something like that yeah yeah that was her and she just recorded everything she just went on for years and years and years like she was Google and see if I'm number one cities for it she was like dominant like like Bob Marley is to reggae you know like really compare to Bob Marley in the sense that that you know probably smoke so much pot in the size of this judging him from the external I know but I want to put my point was if you ask anyone who's the greatest reggae musician of all time everybody's going to say that so that's my point if you ask like a gangster rapper okay well she is what's a gangster rap you could do that to you could do that too but my point was it she's practically unanimously accepted as like the greatest carnatic singing
what's Hannah. That's good to know nothing compared to gangster rap Bob Marley help me in my spiritual life broken. Everybody ready
 okay where we at where are we at chapter 1 and 0 7 x 7 x 7 so what's going on now against Jim what is losing his marbles on the message board the kind she started like a protester now like you've been canceled all my God you just got kicked off of
I talked to Bob a ride so we're we're oh yes I'm very sorry I don't know what I was thinking about Marissa great contributor to the musical gangster rap is a very valuable contribution to society all right, the question was asked Mara spricket is asking I'm stupid it was funny is it that seems like could it be doesn't make any sense that Lord Vishnu is partial it seems like he's kind to the demigods and not so kind of the Demons next chapter like sound and not like other how is God playing favorites
 idea came for the material qualities of a Guna Rodger, and
 Tamil Gana all belong to the material world and not even a touch and do not even touch
is p person out of godhead these three gunas cannot act by increasing or decreasing simultaneously
 what did you see the next to know when the quality of goodness is prominent in the sages and demigods flourish with the help of that quality with which they are fused and surcharge by the Supreme Lord similarly when they would have passion right Rodger Goodell is prominent the demons flourish and ignorance is prominent oxygen rakshasas flourish the spring person out of godhead is present in everyone's heart boss during the reactions of Laguna Laguna and Tamil Gana okay. Sure seems like the arguments being put forward by the first we've heard that Christians above the laws that influence people in this world that they're actually his energies so
it's those it's the influence of those energies that cause us to like one and not like another soap since not only is he Beyond those energies but they're actually his Energies
 so it would be wrong to think that he falls under under that kind of control like we do and now it's saying that just step back and look at you and your you miscalculated the whole thing it seems like he's picking favorite here you don't bring this one up bringing that one down send it's not like that it's it's kind of like how people respond to those energies that they do the flourish when that energy is prominent and then they won't flush when energy is not so it's kind of like if we were to like some plants flourish with a lot of sunlight like in like a arid desert environment
and then other plants you know that they do well in the more tropical environment like shade some like a lot of some grow in the water grow in Shady Grove Water so if you know if you have like a arid kind of circumstance you saying why is God being favorable to these particular pants it sounds like those plants respond well to that environment and if if and when the environment changes
 then other plants will thrive in the Duplantis driving now won't arrive so simile seems like all the neighbors are going up the demons are going down same well that's because of certain mold became prominent you know the Demon's Advocate sir yes it is seen that the personality of God had does appear by the petitioning of the demigods to go down and it up by the demons competition
 you say the demon would petition the petition in the same way that the day was do he would
is how they're responding to my work and works with the quality of the question that you're bringing you up brother. You're almost thinking like March pregnant yeah it's going to go there it's going to go he's going to begin to speak about particular demon is going to get brought up and then and then it's going to go to a conversation between Narda and you to steer and that conversation that's going to begin soon is going to go for the entire seven Canto okay but the but the origin of that kind of weight where that conversation starts as we saw that demon ages hated Krishna
 and yet still we saw them when Krishna killed him it's not like he went to some dark dirty dungeon he'll emerge into the body of Krishnan like like a liberated Yogi might how did someone that was so obsessed with hatred
how did he get blessed like that and so that will do that that question becomes very revealing I actually am thinking like Mirage pregnant sure if I'll get there today the operating person out of godhead exist within the heart of every living being and an expert thinker can perceive how he is present they are too large and small or small extent just as one could understand the supply of fire and wood water in a water pot or the sky with it a pot one can understand just being like are in one can understand whether a living entity is a demon or demigod by understanding that living entities devotional devotional performances
 by their devotional performance has a thoughtful man can understand how much a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions
text him this B personality of godhead creates different types of bodies offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character and fruitive actions
 the Lord revives all the qualities the material nature set the gooner Rodger clew to Luna and Tom oguna then at the Super Soul he enters into each body and influences the qualities of creation maintenance and Annihilation using set for going for maintenance Rodger going for creation and time again for annihilation okay so this is how our material bodies work dude are, we enter to take particular body that particular body has a certain amount of this certain combination of these Kunis
 the funny it's a little but you know what it brought a scientific explanation of the famous old question during this morning so that what came first
the chicken or the egg in humans have pondered this while the chicken obviously came first the chicken or the egg come from for Millennia over this we said we've solved the problem right here it came from Lord for Ma and Lord from Rochester to remember that thing about silliness that we referred to her
 Brahma laying eggs and it was crazy might be crazy not silly though
 I'm saying whatever Mama give you birthday
does it have to be silly but I thought about it it was sort of funny okay okay it's just funny or concept the picture of four headed man just laying eggs I understood that the subtleties
 okay let's be the next Friday
 all right here you go
 11:00 okay King the Supreme personality of godhead the controller the material and spiritual spiritual energies was certainly the creator of the entire Cosmos creates the time factor to allow the material energy and a living entity to act within the limits of time were you here this anywhere else I don't know of any other places are the Supreme personality is never under the time Factor nor under the material energy
I was a Christian and I stumbled upon this book I was like oh my God this is so interested that's what I would it could be some do not open the mind to it
 okay no King this time Factor enhances Laguna time Factor when he was here that's although the Supreme Lord is the controller he favors the demigods who are mostly situated in Laguna
 the demons or influence by Tom abuna are annihilated the Supreme Lord induces the time factor to acting different ways but he never is partial rather his activities are glorious and he therefore it's called hoodoos Strava
 the music wonders why they glorified I believe Schreiber formally
now we're going to hear the question okay or Mele okay for really okay when Maharaj you to steer you to steer is arjuna's older brother he's the eldest of the fond of us who is born of Quinte and Dharma or Jama
 that's pretty interesting
 human woman makes love to a God gives birth to a Celestial child you don't have to use that term what make love or much much
 I mean like that I just meant everything you say to his face and I wouldn't
is it, Brian. He's half face half God half half
 interesting but I wonder if any of us have gods in our family tree I'm serious
 we all do you have higher chances cuz you're a bunch of gotra what's your gotra they are from the same gotra
 but we also do too cuz you know our culture
 ear
 that should I just go check out where Christians go to church where all the Christians go
 so and we all come from Livermore to
related to come on
 you're going to read this question or not sure it's important to read the time and contemplate the body was humko students free with a ceiling is filter life continuing the started again okay and when Mara is you desirous performing the Rochester you sacrifice what was that it was a big religious was a big religious function where they invited all the smaller kingdoms sending Representatives who gave some type of tax to the emperor and it was sort of declaring Mars yudhistira but to be the emperor and to also give worship to Krishna Krishna it was giving worship to Christian I suppose the idea in a simple way is that they had this recognition of how
call the Davis work How the Universe works and if the king could pull together enough influence to make this ritual happen that the effort that he would put into that would bring
 that a Prosperity or you know you bring Good To The Kingdom right sister he's he's kind of as a king is like I need to figure out a way to pull off this timer and in order to do that I'm going to need I need to have such influence that every other Kings going to recognize on the emperor and then we'll get them all to invest in this and then we'll perform this ritual so it wasn't an easy thing to do is, it's the rare a that can pull this kind of thing on what name so Arjuna want to collect taxes from the other kingdoms okay and so they can end when he did that urgent got a special name what name was that okay
is also the source of the story
 and the number to dumb the Hutt me out who was it that refused to pay the tax because he wanted to see I think it will be wanted to see the pond of us or you wanted to fight the pain was so intensely that Chris would have to appear to protect them
 who was it can't start at the store so much that he bought the pain of his for the
 intimacy
 Harper Bryce position as 15,000 did not hear that so you might want to repeat said that this King cuz he was so eager to see Krishna he knew let me fight being the saying was the most ferocious Warrior let me fight him with such
veracity of my own that they put him in a compromised position
 I thought he was he was in danger and so then Christian did appear and then he bowed Oz 400 Krishna and that gladly pay the text cuz he respected you are we out of time there is that what you can
 it's a wonder we just pick up the dispersed tomorrow okay but it's going to take it it's going to get excited now cuz his question of the demon should Falls going to come and we can look into that Pastime and maybe tell more about it but that's going to become the question why did Sugar Bowl get the result that he got when it seemed like he just hated Christmas so much
 all right Miss para little notes did you take here when he
 based on the screen here
 have your heart always turned towards the divine
 nice Style
