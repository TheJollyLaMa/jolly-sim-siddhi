 hello. Hello.
today by
 Lie from Pawtucket Rhode Island this is wisdom of the sages Adele yoga podcast with your horse riding off and co-host and Senior educator the bhakti center New York of stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome to Saturday's sleep way in Saturday usually start at 8 today we start at 3 because I'm on a little mini Weeknd tour with shelter who played in Connecticut we played in Bensalem PA and today we're in Pawtucket Rhode Island tomorrow is New York City and my book signing is at generation records at 1 a.m. 1 p.m. at 1 a.m. don't don't go at 1
hey I'm go 1 p.m. and yeah I've been without Mera by my side I'm leaving things left and right I apologize about the show yesterday I left my computer somewhere and my whole backpacking microphones I've received it now I've lost my wallet in my bead bag I had to use your phone apart places I'm falling apart I had to have to use two shoelaces and tied in knots in the shoelaces and I got 25 not her shoelace to make note 2:26 to make 52 had to add a couple extra that was my had the champ at Weis and add a couple to make my rounds
 yeah I gave them to me back she's going to auction them off the shelter pants and then the devotees came yesterday Eileen shovel in the mercy and Dan Murphy and was very nice and they just they sat outside in the cold I didn't go out and chat with was anyone to lose my voice but I appreciate it and DC dubs was there
and they just sign the holy name for hours as if they were lost in the world of the Holy Name I'm not even sure they came in to see the show
 Eileen you doing okay but anyway it was really nice
 and I will say this cuz it is hard going to bed late at night it's hard to chance when you're in when you're waking up at 10 and you're trying to like find your life and get your life together and put some food in your mouth and
 it's just not conducive towards a regulated spiritual life but that being said I met so many wonderful people at like yesterday show people that we've known for like 40 years that I haven't seen people that used to come to the temple I met one guy who said do you remember when you my brother used to be a roadie for you I don't couldn't remember exactly cuz we have a lot of Roadies
say that our house you did a whole program at our house I was thinking man in the box but it was just like one beautiful story some people are bringing their children there's a lot of families that came to the show the parents and the kids and 120 year old girl came up to beans please take a picture with my father my father has been giving me like you know Krishna through your music for Edomite since I was a baby and I think a lot of them don't become like regular devotees or maybe even chance or anything but definitely like shelter fans there's some level of high Vibe Consciousness that they have when you say that you a misstep dojo Jamie agrees it's like it's like the it's giving them some even one guy came up to be home o s t r as in ghosts
 what if a guy just can't get it to religion but just believes in Walking the good path
it all changes I mean every step we take in this world changes tomorrow
 so weeks per sometimes for certain reasons in our life we can only take so much in maybe we have a partner and it just will destroy our whole marriage and a whole family if I get to into something sometimes people need to take in whatever they can take it in this lifetime and sometimes they go through growth spurts not just in there you know like a little kid go through a growth spurt sometimes they go through their own spiritual growth spurt are you guys listening to podcast today might be in a growth spurt stones are scarce spiritual growth is stunted we feel like we're short of hitting a ceiling again can't get past the stealing stagnation I will sit there like a spiritual experience that book signing which was really sad
that's fine because you just meet people and ask them where they're from and tell him the story and what was your favorite song and it was just like a really nice time and we're doing another one tomorrow at generation records at 1 p.m. that sin because she was coming to show and Mary has come to the show and my daughter and my nephew are coming to the show and Maya is coming to the show and I'm looking forward to it tomorrow okay how are you how are you what's New York like if you feel the earthquake it shook my whole department of rock the place yeah it's dangerous when it came another one came at 6 take the After Shock after shocking
 yeah I felt it too I was in a meeting with with with with the people from Bonnie and I'm talking about us hooking up with them building or Sage Academy oh cool and in the middle of meeting like the whole house to act like rockin around pretty pretty heavy and I was I was kind of just kept going with it
I said it I said to Mikasa think I'm in the middle of an earthquake right now and then when we're done to meet our check is in there you go isn't that weird we were in the earthquake the day before the earthquake yesterday the day before that night I was talking to Charlie from Sue's girlfriend and and it was sent we're talking about natural disasters and where I was like have you ever been in a natural disaster I said I was going to natural disaster with my podcast or do it a podcast in a castle in Italy and there was an earthquake and there was a 800lb chandelier how many of you guys listening to that you can write on the message board were watching the show for the earthquake things cause earthquake episode the earthquake I messed up sometime in June or July
 you know the better is Quake was different that yesterday's earthquake was like what I always think an earthquake is like like everything shaking yeah maybe 10 seconds did the earthquake in
it was like someone hit you in a park like you're parked in the car and someone rammed into your back or something like that yeah I got a jolt one hard jolt tell your natural disasters speaking of natural disasters we're going to we get a special question today. We on the show or Q&A day today is cumin a dead people if you're new to this and it's a day that everybody write some questions and then we try our best to answer them and if you have a question you can mail email Mara wisdom of the sages want to wait at gmail.com she has files he keeps with questions in them as you bust them out to make a stew by every Saturday
 anything else you want to make an announcement mirror
 yeah there's no show tomorrow or Monday and then we'll be back on next week on Tuesday at 7 a.m. special show special special special because he has your book launch day or 7 if you didn't pre-order
there are some people who did pre-order came to the show yesterday with the book and said that it wasn't supposed to come out of the night and I got it I got it today so I think it's starting to show up on people's doorsteps now and if you like what we're doing go to amazon.com and order order one I want to empty or if you already have thank you I just want to thank you won't want to say double it okay what's going on with the questions are you going to read the question their American re today this is for my friend came from Rhode Island. Maybe I'm not sure she's one of these mysterious others Kim cuz I've known her for years to get a teacher training she's a really
 great Yogi she's a scientist who isn't she and she's a she's a dog person she's like a dog whisperer and it's one of the people I've known to the teacher training then she disappeared never star but she's always been out there being other and then every now and then
an email or she shows up at Super Soul farm so what is her question I have a question that is somewhat time-sensitive so hopefully there's room in next week's show
 Aveda culture considers Eclipse has to be in awe swishes but I was wondering if you could direct me to some Lila's that provide a clear explanation the upcoming solar eclipse has been all over the news this past week and I've heard many people talking about their plans to view the event if asked I mentioned that I plan to stay inside and that ancient cultures consider Eclipse has to be an auspicious the most butterflies that just because they didn't understand what was happening implying that they were a more primitive culture I would like to be better informed that I can share with family and friends I appreciate any information that you can provide
 yeah these these superstitious Hindus let's go over there and lie to them and teach them are ways of religion and how to dress and why are they eating with their hands
remedy of Madison interesting it's so like it's it's so sickly imperialistic and Colonial Estates that we have all the answers we can Enlighten these heathens and these barbarians yeah wait wait till Monday or Tuesday my next Monday and a bigger than most eclipses because I'm getting all these warnings from the schools and be careful going to cancel school today and I think it's a big deal it's going to get dark for a while is that it how long does it take a specialist around this question it wreaks right it has it has an aroma or an older I would say
cultural chauvinism I hate to say it but I like that we should so we're hearing from there's an ancient culture and they had a face a belief that these are inauspicious times when there was when there is an eclipse and then someone without any information
 without I'm assuming right where that at least because of the way that what they express without without
 deeply inquiring into the end into this belief they kind of put it in a little box of primitive thinking and they say that's just because they didn't understand what was happening they didn't understand all the stuff that we understand we're far more advanced we have far greater knowledge we know what we're talkin about in there for we don't buy into these superstitious things like that they were printed
okay now now we could go off on this for a long time I love this type of thing I think you're going to look but I want to answer this question on two levels
 the first level is just too to address this cultural chauvinism
 and then the second one is to maybe more just a question of like why how would they come to this conclusion that it's an auspicious you know during an eclipse okay which unless I feel less informed in that you know if we had a real experiences astrologer here then we could get more into that but we'll do our best with that but where I want to start with what you know how I turn 22 to dig up some info on gotta cash I just there's this devoted Steven Knapp Stephen nap right now and another his name and he's a very prolific author
and marriage you know how I met Steven Knapp
 I've always heard about him is that he's very interesting he's got a great video on YouTube about how the Taj Mahal was a Shiva Temple don't care about the Taj Mahal will this is his passion right it is like your little Indian culture really don't want to know how I met him know I do I just wanted to put that out there so we know who the story doesn't mean so much unless we know and help him so he's let me finish that just use the person that like he's an author that has a real passion about digging into ancient Indian culture and finding out just how far out and special was you do in terms of its language its philosophy is architecture it's mathematics you don't like just how advanced is ancient civilization was sure
 so how did you meet a how do I meet him well I was laying over at ORD in the Chicago O'Hare Airport and I was going to the bathroom at a urinal
it was at the urinal unusually at your animals I don't like to look at anybody but someone said are you rocking off and at the other urinal was him and I was like yes I am exchange that the urinal with them because I know who he was and he knew who I was and that's how we met and I never saw him again but I've always thought I just told him how much I appreciated him and then you walked off and we walked around the world again but that was a magical meeting I crashed ran across passing up certain time and place and then you go and that may have been astrologically Destiny but I'm sure okay so for Kim you do like one way that you could begin to respond to this kind of
 when when someone
 categorize is our misguided Miss characterizes the beliefs of The Vedic cultural the ancient yoga stages of the ancient yoga tradition whatever
is you could just start by saying withholding now you know maybe maybe you're just not giving them enough credit you know maybe they maybe they deserve more respect than you're giving them and so we could start this by saying that there's a whole array of Sciences
 that grow out of a tradition or you could say that they're growing out of one body of knowledge called him you know the The Vedic literature right
 and it ends astrology is part of that now astrology is the part that you may have more that people may have a harder time buying into but they did all they have all kind of things in other fields like mathematics an architect you just can't argue with their architecture you can argue with him at Matt and you have to admit that their philosophy what do you believe in his conclusions or not is very sophisticated well-developed and maybe but the place to start with is the language right it is it's like the Sanskrit
which which The Vedic literature is written is so you know what I'm not that guy that knows a lot about language
 but just for my my remedial understanding of it can I help you I don't think you can help if you needed a few quotes and then I'm going to read a little something bad just how special this language was like we don't invent languages we can't develop a language like Sanskrit it just how brilliant is so this is from William Cooke Taylor who is the author of a popular history of British India and he this is what he wrote this this was published in the Journal of Royal Asiatic Society volume two
 it is easy to write it is an astonishing it was an astonishing discovery that Hindustan or India possessed in spy
of the changes of the Realms and changes of time a language of unrivaled richness and variety of language the parent of all those dialects that Europe has finally called classical this Source alike of the source alike of Greek flexibility and Roman strength and I think it has it has a flexibility and a strength that Sir William Jones the eminent scholar and philologist in eighteenth-century I had given the following statement of admiration to the AZ attic society in Cocoa Hut on 1786 East Side the Sanskrit language whatever be its Antiquity, these claims to be the oldest language should I put whatever BS antiquity
 even if it was just invented yesterday is of a wonderful structure more perfect than Greek more copious than the Latin and more exquisitely refined than either
daring to both of them a stronger Affinity both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar now now about Sanskrit Beauty as I pulled this up somewhere the amazing dexterity to the Sanskrit language allows poets to play with each syllable and every word and to make it more lyrical and rhythmic this is what I sent my my very remedial understanding Sanskrit is like if you take an English sentence
 like what's a rug and I just ate lunch
 right if we say if we take that sense and we begin to to play around with you like it we say
 just struggling has ate lunch
 then he's a very different thing that rug not just a lunch it means you were the only one that ain't lunch right and if I say lunch
just a drug or not it's it's like what it says it doesn't make any sense or if I say just rubbing off lunch 8 is now it's just it doesn't make any sense but Sanskrit the ideas that the words themselves each word
 has information encoded into it invested into it in a way where you could take that sense in no matter what combination you put those words in the same message comes across
 and what that does is it gives it tremendous flexibility that now find the poet look at what it gives me the freedom to do I can I can shift the words in any combination that I want and create now it's a language that's going to empower me give me the ability to be to speak for more beautifully because I have no limitations now I could put these words in any way that I want to I can always make it rhyme at the end you know so it has that but it's also got this kind of precision to it
it's a a police of the feature of of the non ambiguity of words in the Sanskrit sentence has made it the perfect perfect for natural language processing in fact a significant part of modern computational Linguistics has a strong resemblance to the kartika concept of Sanskrit in other words the most sophisticated computer language that you're developing
 is at least resembling if not drawing from Sanskrit now there is a NASA associate scientist named Rick brakes
 and he wrote an article called The Vedic science knowledge representation in Sanskrit and artificial intelligence so this was like a report that he's giving to NASA
 in order to help you know who helped direct them and how to develop a computer language and he says there is at least one language Sanskrit
for which the duration of almost 1,000 years was a living spoken language with the considerable literature of its own besides works of literary value there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that is continue to exist with undiminished Vigor Vigor until the present Century their grammar experts devised a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a man in a manner that is identical not only in the essence but inform with our current working artificial intelligence so the reason why I'm reading all this is because when we is when we hero they believed that the wind came from the wind God what what what what what I'm saying is that they believe that oh they believe that eclipses are inauspicious yeah and then they just kind of feel like there's some cavemen they're like oh
 sunblock
bad you know it's just like but know that those that's not who we need to picture when that the information about eclipses being inauspicious is Bristol is coming in this the most sophisticated language not an ordinary ignorant you know what was his pick of caveman or primitive cultures they coming from the most sophisticated culture to develop we owe a lot to the Indians who taught us had account without which had no worthwhile scientific discoveries could have been made that end and that's because they they're the ones that kind of created the 20
 what's the address that is important to advanced math the trigonometry for the Persians which came from the person's got it from India it's one of these ancient ancient cultures and they were again it's not like they were Dum Dums and now we're very evolve
is the opposite they were Gary pop culture and traditions and we're becoming a little bit more thick-headed our language is getting more and more narrow to the point where we're not even communicating were using like WTF lol Emoji heart it's like we're not even using words anymore. Express this weekend so many arguments over a text messages look at look at the the classical Indian ragas and compare them to an images compare the hair that's on the top 10 right now and tell me which culture was more advanced sure not now hear something about architecture which also like a lot of these ancient Indian
 temples were designed to be aligned
with you according to astronomy yeah with the celestial bodies in mind yes so many Indian temples are lying to capture the Rays of the rising or Setting Sun on specific dates 3330 knox's or the solstices like they would have liked a girl porn which is like this it's a gateway to Temple when it said that's a massive Tower that's got like openings in the center on different levels that goes up so I'm not so right yeah I'm on the Equinox or whatever date that they chose that they felt they wanted to honor you would see the sunrise right up through that through window after window like it it's amazing and ends in the end be on that the beauty in the artistic
 stunning artistic demonstration that you know all the carvings in that go poor man be mind-blowing like this was special stuff that they're what does speak of those using massive magnets there's some temples Headmaster
you're going to the lake the deities levitate come on thinking like that are just like hunters and gatherers give me a break and that the sun temple in conarck that's one of them but I have that I found out there was another one in the Gujarat somewhere and then there's some type of Honey is is is incredibly beautiful carved Stone Temple and its is made to look like it's a chariot and all the wheels on it or sundials you can tell the time wheels are Sundial again these weren't like ignorant cavemen now yeah Temple you see there's this idea that the temple should mirror the cosmos the Angkor Wat Temple which is located in Cambodia but it's built according to the principles of ancient Indian architecture in astronomy about that I pulled this up the astronomy and cosmology underlined that is
one of the Angkor Wat Temple was extensively researched in the 1970s and is and it is well summarized in the book by Eleanor Monica basically it was found at the temple served as the Practical Observatory where the Rising Sun was aligned on the equinox and Solstice days with the Western interests of the temple and many setting lines for the seasonally for seasonal observing the risings of the Sun in the moon and then you got this some brihadeeswarar temple in tons and tons of ore and, okay it was built over a thousand years ago they use 130,000 tonnes of granite all beautifully carved
 and that at the top of this Tower
 either way up to high is an 81 single carved piece of granite weighing 80 tons
 how do they get it up there
thousand years ago there was none of the modern machinery that we would have to lift something like that they didn't have cherry pickers or even of a chair Affair could lift 80 tons to the state and remains a mystery how did they do it but megalithic Marvel's it'll happen there are can I text your music mood why do you think Columbus got in his boats and came over looking for a while I think we called Native Americans Indians he's looking for India is looking for a spice or food or walking around Eaton like us scallions and Onion Burgers over and India do like making refined sub Gees and desserts & Suites get sick of their food then herbs and spices and after they were done with all the sweets then they turn to mathematics in his article indic mathematics India and the Scientific Revolution dr. David Gray list some of the most important developments in
history of mathematics that took place in India summarized in the contributions of luminaries such as Arya bhatta but I'm a Gupta mahavira and box box cutter and Marva any concludes by serving the role played by India in the development of the scientific revolution in Europe is no mere footnote
 easily and inconsequentially swept away under the rug eurocentric bias there is to do so as to destroy history and to deny India one of the greatest one of his greatest contributions to World civilizations do you know I asked Santa putas out of here to the the great physicist from Cornell who is a Brahmin I don't think she knew him and mathematician
 I asked him I said well why like why don't we hear that's why doesn't India get the credit why is it that everything at least during my generation was the credit was given to the Greeks to the Rome
and he said
 it's such a hit on the ego for the westerners because India is not like the Greeks and the Romans who are those cultures are cemented over like we we talk about ancient Greece it was an ancient place is like no one is there worshiping Athena today and no one's worshiping these Roman gods today but India is still a living culture and it's almost humiliating that we have to bow to this living culture sure that's right to speak of when your chauvinism and almost like competition and at least four up to my generation you don't hear about classical music of any other place except coming from Europe Europe every culture had classical music come on
 it maybe not everyone okay
no it's like every every culture you don't talk about these ancient cultures all have their ways of using especially music to worship higher power source God angels no doubt now Lin yutang the Chinese scholar and author he wrote that India was China's teacher and trigonometry quadratic equations grammar Fanatics and so forth
 an unless than Francois Voltaire stated everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges everything has come down to us through the banks of the Ganges you know what I agree I agree Rajan off agrees for what it's worth. Astronomer and monk Severus writing and c e 662
as expressed in a l Bush a book The Wonder that was India explained he said I shall now speak of the knowledge of the Hindus other subtle Discovery in the science of astronomy describe Discovery is even more ingenious than those are the Greeks and Babylonians of the rational system of mathematics or of their method of calculation with no words can pray strongly enough I mean the system using 9 symbols if these things were known by the people who think that they alone have mastered the Sciences because they speak Greek
 they would perhaps be convinced though a little late in the day that other folk not only the Greeks but men of a different tongue know something as well as they
 wow it's amazing how you and I have to like bolster people Spades with all this back story with a
started we ourselves are you know culturally raised to think India is inferior it's a dirty country it's a third-world a developing Nation you know it is a stork Lee you kind of have to dehumanize or minimize the the the the the civility of a nation that you're conquering if you want to rape it of all is well we're helping them out we're helping these losers out it'll it's for your ultimate good you don't even quite understand that you're going to try to resist a little but hear me out you're worshipping up also that's that's so silly our Lord heading into our Lord Has Come and told us that's all nonsense we're here to help you and let you know I was thinking about the the question and then in a person saying oh that's just because they didn't know anything
 a person a sage living in a in a in a pristine
simple Grass Hut on the bank of a River Brighton three thousand years ago five thousand years ago had the ability to predict the exact moment date and time of this Eclipse that's coming up on Monday
 write this was another way that these people were not the people that were writing The Vedic literature in telling us that that that eclipses are inauspicious they could do that
 we can't even predict like a thunderstorm. It's not that doesn't rain we've got meteorologist we've got all these instruments we're still getting it wrong but the but the in other words the same people that are telling us whose inauspicious had the capability of doing that when the Europeans Millennia before the Europeans were still convinced that the world was flat now dick taste Dick Tracy author the guy see Dick Tracy
Dick Tracy the author of the God particle and co-founder of omni magazine rights in ancient roots of modern science
 I'm in India we see the beginnings of theoretical speculations of the size and nature of the earth some 1,000 years before Aristotle The Vedic Aryans asserted that the Earth was round and circle the Sun
 these are the Primitive people have so much stuff here and I think you like some stuff
 American Professor Jabez T Sunderland president of the India information Bureau of America spent many years in India he was the author of India in bondage where he wrote quote India created the beginnings of all sciences and she carried some of them to a remarkable degree of development thereby leading the world India has produced great literature
great art great philosophical Systems Great religions and great men in every Department of Life rulers Statesman financers Scholars poets generals colonizers skilled Artisans and grass Eaters of every kind of Agriculture list industrial organizers and leaders and far-reaching trade and commerce by land and sea
 Lord korsin the British Statesman who is a Viceroy in India from 19 from 1899 to 1905 as stated in his address delivered to the great deli Door bar in 1901 he said powerful Empires existed and flourished here in India while the Englishmen were still wandering wandering in the woods while the English colonies were Wilderness in a jungle and he has left a deeper Mark upon the history the philosophy and the
take me to mankind than any other terrestrial unit in the universe
 boom is so much we should be on payroll from the prime minister is like
 if you can you can you can try Frederick Slagle also he said that he had high regard for India stating that everything of high philosophy or science is of Indian origin
 French scholar and judge Lewis Jackal diet in his Bible in India rights astonishing fact the Hindu Revelation the betas is of all Revelations the only one whose ideas are in perfect harmony with modern science as it proclaimed the slow and gradual formation of the world
and of course we can see that the videos in which the astrophysicists Carl Sagan says quote the Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great face dedicated to the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and births it is the only religion in which the timescales correspond to those in modern cosmology now favorite writer of yours and mine drug not Mark Twain Mark Twain of he had some good ones yeah he wrote the cradle of love language
 I don't know what that's what I'm going to read okay maybe it is cradle of civilization the cradle of civilization in following the equator he says this is India or the Cradle of the human race cradle of the human race is pretty cool birthplace of human speech
 mother of History
grandmother of Legend great-grandmother of tradition who's yesterday's bear date with the mouldering Antiquities of the rest of the nation's India had the start of the whole world at the beginning of things she had the first civilization she had the first accumulation material wealth she was populist with deep thinkers and settle into Lex
 I would have loved to walk around India with Mark Twain what I mean that would be great you I think you would have been good friends I think you like me I'm serious I'm not just saying that I think one of the people I know wouldn't like me and couldn't tolerate me but I think Mark Twain would Francois
 he would have been into you call Tara Voltaire wouldn't give me you wouldn't have a meeting with a meeting with me
all right let's read a few more even a scientific discoveries there are those who acknowledge the knowing that is taking the rest of the world ages with which to catch up for example Frederick Spielberg rights in spiritual practices of India with an introduction by Alan Watts quote to the philosophers of India however relativity is no new discovery all right so that the theory of relativity came by in this in the last century right now you go back go back Millennia and 10. They're writing about it in India to the philosophers of India however relativity is no new discovery just as a concept of light years is no matter for astonishment to the people used to thinking of time and millions of culpas days of Vermont
 the fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with the technological applications of this knowledge
the fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with the technological applications of this knowledge arises from the circumstance that technology is but one of innumerable ways of a pliant
 it is indeed a remarkable circumstance that one Western Civilization discovered relativity or this is so this is brilliant he's saying that that in India that they knew about the theory of relativity relativity
 then why did they invent the kind of things that we invented
 and he saying they just might have been interested in using a technology that knowledge you know their ways and so and and and how how a culture would use it says a lot about the evolution of that culture
 and so he says I read again the fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with the technological applications of this knowledge arises from the circumstance that technology
is but one of the new verbal ways of applying it it is indeed a remarkable circumstance that when Western civilization's discovered relativity it applies it to the manufacturer of atom bombs
 or as The Vedic civilization applies it to the development of new States Of Consciousness I like that very interesting right yes Special K has I call you we've been building up India developing people's faith in the culture in the language of the intelligence behind what is presented but we've only got about 12 more minutes left and we got into the rest of that question okay good point. So what we've been addressing here is just the cultural chauvinism in the question okay that that to take it one step further to say that to make the assumption that they believed that eclipses were inauspicious is it clear in Decatur
that they didn't know anything that they were primitive that is actually the Primitive that that is the very primitive attitude that they're criticizing them self or you go grab it and flip it because in other words without any information without any investigation to just throw that out there is just like a primitive person looking at eclipse is a bad bad Omen you know right right right so they're guilty of exactly what they're what their criticizing but then let's talk about astrology isn't so much my field but
 just speaking in a very general way I'm not going to be able to prove to a skeptic that it's true I've always wanted to I would love to put this together someday is to put together an experiment where you bring let's say 20 Vedic astrology
 and you begin to feed them pairs of
astrological charts that are very different from one another so in other words you get the chart of a person that's wealthy famous and has 10 kids right and then you get another chart of a person that's not famous dirt poor and never had a kid okay and then you then you give them to you give this the same charge to 20 different astrologers
 and you say which one is which they could do it it and then you and then you and then you do that say with like a hundred pairs of charts
 and then you see how accurate the in other words now if astrology has no basis then they should be right 50% of the time and wrong 50% the time right but what is the right 90% of the time right then and then you really have to do it so I would love to see that being said I'm not going to be able to prove to a skeptic that that they 2 cast
ecology is valid but let's just try to take it out of the characterization of silly primitive superstitious like that kind of thought and say that these these sages that were composing in in the in the world's most refined and precise beautiful language well developed sophisticated language Sanskrit they were writing these ancient texts with his incredibly dense philosophy
 in developing so many signs is out of that as we've been discussing here at Weatherby architecture Weatherby mathematics Weatherby Linguistics Weatherby medicine philosophy in in so many ways all of this is growing out of these literature's that they're writing that they had a vision of the universe right that they had it that they with their intellects
and they would even say with through their Visions to through their experiments cuz they knew so much about the mind that that people are are now just discovering so they would they would do experiments with her mind with her breathing went in and try to you know going to use that to enter into deeper states of knowledge in perception so with their perception in with all that they knew they saw a vision they developed a vision and recorded that in these texts of how everything in the universe is connected is not disconnect is connected right so like for instance if you if you take a radio and if you just put it in you just if someone for the first time so a radio and it was playing this music
 and they said this isn't crowded even look at this thing this radio is making this music What a Wonder of nature
 it's a random thing it happened
buy some random combination of these things coming together but isn't it a wonder that if you give it enough time that that's you know nature will just produce this radio that is playing this music turn this dial turn another dial it's going to make some noise I'm staticy noise and then you're going to hear music and all you have to do is turn dials and then use it comes out of the box and nature just created it without anything being behind it and the dials appear of what makes the music happen and so I'm helping you and so and then you said no you don't understand
 there's this little box it's making this music is connected to two people that very intentionally produced music in another Realm
 end end and they can crowded it and it traveled through the air
and was an encoding was picked up by this box and now it's playing on you in there be like don't give me your mythology I don't want to hear your silly mythology like we can't see those people we can't see any waves this is a silly mythology older these alien beings that are created in the music and it's magically transferring into this box you know so many miles away I don't buy into your mythology so are the empiricist Tennessee everything is disconnected and random
 and these grade Brillion sages their their Vision was that everything is connected and not random but intentional and that behind everything behind did the sacred texts behind all the Sciences behind the cosmos behind every planet and every mountain and every river there's in individual personal Direction and presents
so they went so when they see what's happening here on this Earth is like the radio and what's happening in the cosmos is like sending signals you know and so they see all of this connected and the end they say that we can just look at these patterns and understand what's going on like to eat in a simplistic way we could say look what happens when the weather changes when when things are cloudy 4 days or cold for months
 it affects people psychology people become more grumpy people become more depressed you could say that's inauspicious that's an inauspicious time right and they could understand that when these eclipses occur that it's it's affecting people's moods it's affecting people's Consciousness and that these can create inauspicious times and that would be not the wisest time to take up this particular activity and That's essential that's what astrology is all about it's saying we we can see the connections
that that that the intelligence behind the universe has left us a lot of fascinating ideas and clues about how it's all connected you can see it in the cosmos you can see you can see it in the palm of someone's hand you know that the clothes are there that love their bodies the markings on their bodies and if and if someone is set aside their skepticism and it approaches it with an open mind and with people that are qualified to understand and explain it you open yourself up to a world very fascinating world of science if I open up a hood of a car but I don't understand it it takes him a can of who understands the language of what sounds the engine or making like if I go in there until they had a car is going kick kick kick kick kick I know what it means but the mechanical show the tick tick tick sound that means your carburetors off or there's a language of understanding how the radio works and if I don't know how it works is that it sounds like music just coming
Xbox but I don't understand what the receiver is with the satellite is there all seems far and once you understand the language of the radio so to speak yes then it also makes sense that's the same way per person just looking at the palm of your hand just looks like a bunch of lines and creases cuz my hand folds a certain way but for someone who knows that language they can read that bomb in the same way they can read the celestial bodies that's her and I are not those people we just understand well we hundred we've heard from so many sources including the appearance of the Avatar Lord Tanya on his birthday eclipse happen why would that be on inauspicious is because for Brahmin us the brahmas don't want to witness the eclipse they want to stay inside or they want to go into the holy River and chants and Allergy tiny came and everybody went yeah and that's what we get that's where the common people are picking up these ideas
is there going to be storms like that or they're going to read about
 well these other stores like for instance in Bogota me read how all of the at the residence of a Dobbin as well as a resident of dwarka on the on the eclipse they all say this is an auspicious time let's all go to the holy Place group chaitra together yes good one good one so and I'm sure there's this is where it becomes widespread people read the people have faith in these texts for so many reasons this was Crystal's Christmas people are saying this and that and then you could get a scientist or astronomers or astrology especially the in again these were not some guy with a bone through his nose that's like you know just some ignorant some lady with a crystal ball and a bandana
like a brilliant philosopher and Scholar that that has like habits in a whole life like I did this guy was we have today you look at in the in the back of their life and just feed their their their whatever they're thinking it has an 11 to a more noble lifestyle and more refined life-size I respond best to Hector tailed reasons what antenna is also different types of eclipses and they can tell you how that works in the same way I can tell time but don't know how to build a watch it doesn't matter I can tell time that's what made me I understand these symptoms just like when I was going to get into the yoga system they say hey her some breathing techniques to breathe and kicks her legs are very good for you I just had faith in the yoga system but I did them you know and you know we learned all these things are becoming very popular within the scientific Community now cold baths are good for you breathing is very important mindfulness is Earth
ashram at a young age do most of the things that people developing and catching up with right now if so I hope you have you do we still have an answer for her do it I mean I have him neither of us are astrology so like if you're going to ask me precisely why is it like it is there a correlation like Frances people will argue that there's a correlation between the full moon and people's moods and you could that's that's some becomes you could eat that becomes reflected and say like crime statistics
 and then someone could go further and say well there's a reason because the body is made up of this much water in the Moon is pulling the ties and it's also pulling her but I'm not ready to give you a you know I don't I don't have that level of explanation but what I'm just all I'm really trying to do is to say I have faith in this because I have faith in so much that this culture has provided
that experience directly my own life I've seen how sophisticated how it developed scientific how brilliant it all this and so if you're going to say I can't prove it are enough but if you're going to say I'm a moron because I have faith in it will maybe you're the one who's Crazy back where we started from where we started from cultural chauvinism all right I think we're out of time but I hope that helps and we got more people here got DC does join us
