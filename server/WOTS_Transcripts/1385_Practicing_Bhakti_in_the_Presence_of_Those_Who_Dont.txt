 walk on Wednesday today yeah one of my favorite people matter fact me and mukunda and Mary were in the car and Christina said hey who's walk on Wednesday and we all just said and watching it just came out of her mouth like a Watson she's very lovable lady welcome in welcome to the show about what happened last time what episode was that the dam was on last time
 1125 11:25 it was a lake
walk on Wednesday that took up the whole show all right it was a moving story may want to send it up quick rather yeah well it was no she's happily married with a son and they have this Vineyard in their backyard in the hills in California Southern California and her husband came home it was said I got to pay wasn't feeling well she encouraged your husband to go to the doctor against his you know I don't want to go you know they found a tumor the size of like a cannonball in his in his body and they gave him and decide death sentence you have like whatever unless you write emergency radiation
 chemo you want to share a little bit or a lot to talk about now we're talkin about the future but if you want to just wrap that up
brief summary I guess if anybody didn't hear that episode and thank you it was Cannonball grapefruit whatever you'd like to yeah whatever you want him with diagnosed with stage-4 stomach cancer and it had traveled to his liver and his lungs and the worst was the cancer liver tumors and they told me a days to live and I guess basically you can go back and listen to that episode won't go into it too much but
 I now call that time in my life the hardest worst best thing that ever happened to me which sounds very bizarre, play but very spiritual person gets it right every person connects the specialized ality gets hit that gift of pain
I actually jotted down last night I was like I want to try and get the things that I don't take a shower and obviously being brought to the path of yoga is ultimately why I'm so grateful that that all happened I learn to surrender to the unfolding of life and they are not in control, learn to trust I definitely learned that we are not our bodies that I got to say that I got to see him leave his body and that was the ultimate lesson
 I got to see this I didn't mention I was thinking the other episode but It ultimately traveled to his brain and that was what took him and he was having a stroke and he would come in and out of the city where was like he'd have his personality and then he wouldn't leave have a know where he is and then he wouldn't and he be able to write as a
and then he couldn't and I remember someone saying and I was so sad it's not 10:00 anymore and that hit me and then I went oh my gosh our brains are organs and that was a real or not our thoughts I thought it was right exactly and then I guess the other thing that ultimately love someone unconditionally as an act of service to something greater than myself
 and that
 it's funny cuz you mentioned like happily married and I didn't go into this cuz I think that is a stage was almost exactly a year ago that I was here talking to you guys and what a beautiful full circle
her now there was deep darkness in our marriage that I never admitted to never talk to and I think that when somebody is for screaming it's very easy to put someone on a pedestal and idealized something and that darkness that we had in our marriage really was a lot related to alcohol and both of us struggle with that and so frankly the gift again of his illness was both alcohol stopped for him completely and I was drinking for a little bit longer until into the journey I went I don't I'm not feeling this either as I found spiritual so that leaves two kind of awkward at me talking about today is Sara Lee a spiritual person but when this came down it started making you dig a Little Deeper extremely okay and this for takeaways cuz I felt like we were very $0.06 in very useful and good takeaways for all of us today at work
surrender I'm not this body the shredder to the unfolding witches were like acceptance right I'm not this body which was a good one or the second one again off of mind that our mind is an organ our brain an organ that wasn't one of them to your takeaways reminder separate from who we are and then ultimately that an experience of pain can become an opportunity to love unconditionally from a motor service greater than yourself it's not I wasn't necessarily always doing it for him I'll be real he was deeply unpleasant to me a lot of time
and so it wasn't like oh we have this magic magic goodbye naira I would be yelling at you a lot just waiting area right now don't you know I don't
 knows he was all so I'll just say this again just being really vulnerable here I've made that cuz I'm in this morning like I'm on my I'm just going to be vulnerable with you guys this morning again in the motive service to those in anyone who might hear this that I can help that he was he never loved himself and he never found a spiritual path and so because of that there was a deep unhappiness in him up to the minute he left he was fighting an angry and it was it was why is this happening
where I was able to offer him that unconditional love and literally hold his hand instead of see things differently and we never got to a place where we saw things the same way now we do external a successful you can pay bill everything must be Rosy and so you have this beautiful cuz me and what kind of weather for dinner cuz you are not only a great chef but you're a good photographer which we're going to fish in her to get marra's marriage was with sages cookbook done we're looking forward to that if you're interested in that was 16 cookbook say something on the message board right now but but
 while we were there they have this beautiful Vineyard and their backyard and
alcohol doesn't necessarily necessarily go great with your spiritual path you want to share a little bit about because you posted something recently that's what inspired me to reach out to you I'm after we saw you at the El Rey theater
 it really is quite cool because it was your visit again about a year ago you and what kind of coming over for dinner that planted this little seed in my brain that's like what what happened what did I what magical thing did I say to you and and you did look up leading up to that what had happened and I'll give a little bit more background is it so we do we have a Vineyard and that was Tim's job he ran the vineyard full-time plant it when we moved here in 2014 we had our own wine label
and the label itself W Ranch Vineyards I mean it's an LLC I'm going to the licensing all this stuff it was like my vice was wine like in our darker times of marriage he was a guy and I was one girl and it was like crack open a bottle every single night because if you can't beat them join them with kind of where I was in a Darkness I was asleep I was numbing myself I was very unhappy and alcohol was a way that I escaped and so it was like well let's make a legitimate business out of this because the habits and makes it even more socially acceptable before I go into any of this I by no means judge anybody who drinks alcohol or like nor do I personally think that fight yeah I don't have a problem with others if that's her choice but for me it was very very very is
pediment to my growth and got in there but as I was carrying on Tim got sick what are we going to do with the vineyard I started running it was just like okay I've got to keep this business going because this is his legacy and oh gosh if he dies I got to carry it on to show that I'm like the dutiful wife and on this label and all of us but five years ago again when he got sick I stopped drinking and I was on this completely different path and it started feeling very disingenuous for me to be modeling Like I Do by our wine and promoting and hosting why not doing this all at the same time personally my heart was just not in it my passion has completely turned another Direction until you guys come over for dinner
 I went walking to the vineyard I like comments in the grapes and let's go taste them cuz I was right before Harvest and they were two
and you always pick I was even them
 I like a little like a little squirrel and I was like other people had kind of plant that from you but something about how you said it in that moment when we were eating the grapes and I was like huh there's a seed if they'd planted in my mind and then literally that following weekend as only those who know me will understand it's only a do I had to sit there spiritual experience of the Metallica concert in the end
 apparent in the pit in a Metallica concerts were all realizations come in the pit is like a how old is a ten-year-old k'tan 10 year old
Prodigy yeah that's a whole other story but basically he is he he definitely came in I think picking up from a previous lifetime if you ask me cuz he is quite something on guitar he's and he loves metal he plays metal he's into rock and metal in Metallica is one of our favorite bands so I took him to his first Metallica show the weekend after I saw you we were down in the pit and I literally felt like I could hear it in his voice at one point just being like the wine isn't my legacy our son is wow wow thing him just rocking out and having fun smile and I'm standing there
 and I was crying with joy I just thought oh my gosh I don't have to do this I don't have to do this I even could I scattered even some of Tim ashes in the vineyard
it's a very sacred place for me what what Don Don me was what you said I didn't have to return it I talked about like you look at life like a diamond I'm just going to turn it and look at another fast and see it differently and she's to look at it another way and yeah I got home and the following weekend I remember I called the winemaker and just said I'm tapping out how do I start on doing this wow it was big and it's been a long sort of 7/8 month process of trying to undo and it there's a grief that comes with it for sure because it is so linked to memories of of my husband and what his legacy was going to be right now I see funny enough I'm flying to Chicago tomorrow to take Russell to a Metallica concert
who knows I'm excited it's going to be amazing but it's because now I have freed my time and shifted my priorities to where I'm Focus I'm choosing to focus I'm not harvesting grapes this fall I'm going to be attending concerts and supporting my son then
 if you need to speak to you Moon a jelly sure maybe there's a connection right there right she knows every thought about what you want to do with the vineyard what is happening right now is a local Winery is running it and taking the grapes and making the wine so I do have the one who's using them it's just no longer something the base way I'm I am putting love and attention and service into the land and I still live on it it's my backyard basically but yeah I'm just wide open actually even jelly I'd like I would be
 open again
take away number 12 I'm surrendering to where this goes and saying because I think for a bit there I was scared to do this because a lot of people are afraid to let something go for financial reasons and big shift and for me honoring the truth of my sobriety felt deeply important as well as honoring my son than his legacy this is every Ranch Jelly's what do you think I was thinking Smuckers sweet things like we're holding on to a lot of stuff stuff that we've cultivated it didn't necessarily service but it's become part of our identity and part of our Persona part of our are false ego how we present and then as you go in your spiritual path you're like
 this doesn't fit anymore this doesn't make
anymore I don't want to be this and so before I can grab something higher I asked if the should have let go which already in my hands take some courage and its courage because you're letting go of something and you're like is anything going to be out there to embrace so it is beautiful to witness that at and when I saw you post that I was really I was at whoa this is getting Next Level cuz those are deeply woven in the same way when Mara had her her catering business in a successful catering business with tons of clients that all ate meat and then she went through the whole transformation like I have to let go in hopes that I can reach out for something more it is so thick and it's an extension of the first realization that you had about what was the first one you said about
 about render during to the unfolding of life it has something sinful going to be able to do that you can't keep holding on to the Past you got to be ready to see where care
absolutely and for it to unfold and I think I'm a very controlling person by nature and I like to plan and I want to know where things are headed and I think that I literally I do this all the time I probably was a crazy person and it's like the way that I feel okay let go and like I'm trying so hard let go a person you're married to for 15 years ago doesn't teach you how to let go and see the blessings and something and what possible when you do I do I woke up so it's yeah it does you're absolutely right it feels like a bag of rocks around with me that I was collecting this stuff and yeah we don't need to do that
 lesson learned lesson beautiful beautiful cuz there's a lot of bitterness that can be there to the bitterness and anger why me
and you somehow flipped it and saw the blessing and it's quite impressive and inspiring for our community to hear I'm glad you're part of our community you lift us up when we see you for a little thank-you honored to be on today thank you for asking you thank you. Walk on Wednesday is a great we're looking forward to Watson family jelly or watching Family non-alcoholic wine
 thank you and love to your son and rock out maybe meet up with Laura from Chicago she's on the show today she's here today. We got Zoomers all over the place and others all over the place. Have a great show and have more spiritual realizations in the pit
 that was nice it was nice this is Tosh.
yeah I am always impressed when these people are just up to let go something that's that big not even if it's not easy it's not take it for granted that our spiritual life going to fall some courage you know take take a few risks that's going to be there and we're bump into some forks and like I got to go north here you know she also said it's very interesting thing about alcohol and like you know it was part of like you know what we did and I was wanting girl he was a beer guy but you know there's a lot of back story with that as well that is not how my service as I got the party it's fun hey let's wind down
 that's the circus Center that's a surface there was a day when she had the insight to see it as that. There is a Darkness it is masking something and then will the vineyard you could be like yeah but you don't want to romanticize is the whole thing a Vineyard come to my wedding yet
oh we have a 1962 bottle of
 Chardonnay I think you would like you're so uncultured in the west you become refined at the culture of eight Thomas and Rogers we're like we're refining we're refining Thomas, go in and Rogers goon the mode of passion the motivator Encino
 you hear people say that with whiskey don't you like all of this is a very smooth whiskey smoothie to buy you should dream that Smoky flavor Mochi place where I can find Cuban cigar costume like we have to riches at flavor right right you have to develop a pallet for the motivating rats
 the problem the motivate
is it can historically dismantle your life
 you know I remember on that show
 Mad Men you know that he's a big advertising guy went and hid it they got their biggest client is like it is like a cigarette company and it in all the all of the researching and government information is coming down now it's like you know smoking causes cancer and like so they like what do we do now with our campaign every but you know and and then they can't figure out any way to frame it spend this and then but a certain point like the other than the main character goes like that well the good thing is is like all your
 all your competitors have the same problem
 but they're going to be busy trying to convince everybody like that this isn't so bad that it gives you cancer it's not as bad as you say but he said but we can look at it different way and then you just said tell me how you
could the cigarettes what like what do you do all the first you grow tobacco then we Harvest it would dry it and we toasted and we just do is hold it right there and they write on the board it's toasted how does the Mind work and you know that sounds nice and warm and nice flavor to it and just say it's toasted and you know our our tobacco is toasted to say yeah well they are they all toast it doesn't matter to even things that are harmful for a painful disease that causes suffering we romanticizing we survive in a world of romanticizing stuff that doesn't give what we think it should give you know we have plans ideas the Hobbies off
music Yannick kind of aspect you know to yoga practitioner this analysis right where you kind of cut through the sentimentality so no it's not toasted. The point is likes it so yeah it sometimes we need to apply that and slice a little you know it's like the little off and say
 let's go let's get down a truce here
 and I have the courage to make a step so I appreciate it and it's doing
 are you ready to get into you ready to Dive In The Stream on block of a town I really am we're heading back today that's hit a plane soon couple hours going to go for a little morning hike I hope it goes smooth for you right now thank you
 an intelligent man Narayan on the musketeer that I'm driving to tell Mom David bazan cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan until
I wish you the most human being to Miley Cyrus watching the goddess of learning in the should be off today of the author not stopped right about everything I sticky but regular tennis classes the Baga Tom and bedroom service to the pier to go to use all that is troublesome the heart would become eradicated and love a service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with Transit at the songs will be established as a revocable fact I was born the darkness of ignorance my teachers open my eyes and it's worth $7 over my base and seized after Lotus feet I'm finishing my Bob and Tom Canto 7 chapter 14 x 6 let's have a quick quick quick quick recap here right now
 Cabot never got the Naruto the Great Sage speaking to the great king you just year and previous chapters we've heard about the
directions for renuncia it's now we're here in the directions for householders people that live in a home people with family and you know that and it kind of opened up by saying that you know we have a tendency to be affected he uses the word the word affection right we become affected by the Comforts of home by the the physical connection with the spouse and then so on and that this can condition us to seek happiness to Rex Terminals and miss the goal of human life to find the Eternal happiness lies within us all rather than husband and wife helping each other fine that you together we searched for it outside or from each other and ultimately become disappointed with how much so he says about the way to live in that circumstance and not become affected her condition by is by hearing Bob was home again and again and again right contemplating these these truths on a daily base
ceiling gazing with the sacred ancient vibration this literature
 and then he said something in the last verse that was really interesting which was you know the question then becomes will and this is really
 relevant for for us and for our listeners I think a lot of our listeners especially it but what's being shown here is that this was even even Millennia ago this was an issue is not Samara seemed like I got into Berkeley but my spouse isn't so into it or my family Isn't So Intruder in my workplace nobody understands it how do you deal with that when you're practicing bought the in in in the atmosphere in the circle and the circumstance of your surrounded by people that don't practice it or don't understand it how do you respond in our Tennessee might be well you lecture them you correct them you cut them off you know chastise them
shame them down to them yeah, that works well and he has a very different idea he gives the kind of like the idea that he's sharing he was more like on how to adjust navigate around it with some diplomacy right with just like how to find your how not to don't create obstacles in the end so he in the last text he said on
 while working to earn their livelihood as much as necessary to maintain Body and Soul together so Simplicity is being recommended here to write as much as you need don't overextend one who is actually learned should live in human society unattach from family fares although externally appearing very much attached it's like saying you don't have to you know you can just kind of move through this world and in a sense something's going on within you that nobody's even aware of and he's going to he's going to double down on that go a little bit deeper into this next tech sorcerer first expert
number six intelligent man in human society should make his own program of activities very simple because if there are suggestions from his friends children's parents brothers or anyone else he should externally agree saying that is all right but internally he should be determined not to create a cumbersome life in which the purpose of life will not be fulfilled he's seeing she would happen is that is that like he's being duplicitous I think he's realizing with intelligence of these people want stuff of this world and he's stepping back saying those things will not satisfy a but oh yes it's sort of like a piecing them words but really realizing that
 you know it's just complicating your life yesterday complicating your life more and more you know you're talk about RVs yesterday you know recreational vehicles are
Legos winnebago's Winnebago Warrior the RV stand for the ruins vacation cuz there's so many things that can go wrong and them and he was sharing one stewart what happened that the slider that pops out would not pop back in she couldn't do it if they couldn't go anywhere he couldn't drive with it and then of course it's a huge investment and there's millions of things that can go wrong and then I'm going to say yeah that's a great idea cuz with you ever I walked in RV lots and they're exciting it's like this is like a house it's on your own wheels what is a forest and bring your cabin with you wherever you go then there's also the boats my my friend who had a board said the tube that in this a famous thing that the two best days for a boat are owner
are you buy it because it comes I got to store the boat I got to I got to store the boat in the winter I got to make sure there's nothing wrong with about you know does Barros not home right now she's got a bill. She's got a building we got a house and another house
 and this other house with our kitchens going to leak in it so it is it's just like so much worried that comes with stuff in the back of her mind with a ball this is going to be great is going to give me so much pleasure but there's always a payback so thoughtful people say you know what keep it simple keep it as simple keep it simple and end you noticed here also.
 When someone like it's just real, you know they want someone who from the West they first get into the spiritual he's not like you grow up in it and it's kind of like a normal thing but when you get in spiritually sick all I'm getting into this alternative thing
and is common that the externals of that alternative
 we may be just as much into that as if we are into the substance of it also there's a lot of pretentiousness I'm going to wear these spiritual clothes I want to wear shoes when I get the spiritual tattoo and I'm going to use some spiritual terms I'm going to walk around being a spiritual Lookout spiritual where is this is saying no no no you can you do like I said that you should one who's actually learn it should live in human society unattached internally although externally appearing very much attached it's like don't even pose a spiritual attack will actually help you be deeply spiritual like right because part of our part of our ego we don't just want to switch egos you know we want to actually understand that we don't want to present as something that we are not to get
validation from
 from my community I will look so spiritual now I can tell by his what was beard you know sometimes your hair is so nice now. As long as they are crazy as a big beads on that big beads make a more spiritual where can I buy those beads it was such a cuz only were that simple
 yeah I mean I I'll say when I go to a temple or stop is that gift shop gift shop when I got here what's in that gift shop here they got some unique here so you know what you're okay so you're posing as you like as like you're like a common materialist you got you got absolutely nothing too kind of proved externally and it
facilitating your your your steadiness in this like it's kind of like a saving you from wasting time debating with everyone or getting it you know it's like you kind of send you do that's fine we can do that we can do that I do apologize people try to like the 4th or political statement with me I was like oh okay I understand exactly I'm going to void the the long drawn-out time wasting energy stuff you weigh stations Austin that is going to fix things sitting here in the car
 we can figure out the world after all I am a genius I'm just waiting them for the SBA yes certainly this one side of the whole thing we should get really what is the ask about that and ignore the other side but yeah so it's so it's just some practical advice or you don't have to appear extremely spiritual at all
he was her timeshare this analogy of like a woman with a parm or lover married woman parm or lover so at home you know she doesn't want to appear like her mind's always thinking of her love her so she's kind of even be more careful to do her duties around the hot like she does want to be like what's with you lately like so you're saying if your partner is acting very normal and healthy and happy Lookout most likely she's got some lover Mara up to yeah I've noticed everything seems wonderful wonderful Mara if a woman has a par Mar lover she's like extra careful to do everything on the home like really well
 and dumb butt butt internally
 always
meditating on her lover so like a spiritualist can be like that to that externally were very responsible and dutiful and taken care of everything's not like because we got spiritual suddenly we we became negligent in our duties but as we can carry out those duties even better than we were at them before
 or Jordan internally always meditating on our Lord in the horse
 the natural products created by the Supreme personality of godhead should be utilized to maintain the bodies and Souls of all living entities the natural products resources Tom's toothpaste it resources
 the necessities of life are three types those produced from the sky from rainfall from the Earth from mines the Seas or the fields or
Maps fear that which is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly what is it's it's getting into the resources that we have what when you the all the renunciate swear there's a brahmacharya Lovato press to the seniority
 they're not out there they're not like the
 the password of H administrative of all of the the produce all of the the resources they kind of just like give me a little resource in Ark survival evolved with tiny little thing there is where is that the household is there really kind of like that I don't know what the right word is but like the under your seat like the Bread Basket or some like that they're the real providers you know they're the ones that are eating their farming they're building yeah they're banking they're trading they're doing all these things and we're going to do it so then
obviously like that's potentially you no attachments develop their third which will become problematic for deeper spiritual growth so now not as getting into dealing with these resources how we utilize him how the householder relates to them thinks about them and gauges these resources
 text 81 McClain proprietorship to as much wealth as required to obtain Body and Soul together sank like keep it simple keep it simple again enough is enough
 but one who desires proprietorship over more than that must be considered a thief and he deserves to be punished by the laws of nature so greed because you know the subject here right at
 what has to be really careful about taking more than they need it is not even just more than I need
but there's an attitude you know that attitude is spoken about in the the issue Upon a Child in the east of us it's show me dumb sort of on that we need to kind of see that like my my basic needs that's my quota you know everything animate or inanimate that is within this universe is controlled and owned by the Lord I don't I didn't create the the food that grows out of my alarm that I got for my second it's hard to save money reading the bottom of time save money. It's hard to save money prepare for your future reading the body of a time you said one should therefore accept only those things necessary for them for them self which are which are set aside as their quota and what should not accept other things going well to whom they belong right now this looks to me when we aspire to live for hundreds of years if you continually goes on working in that way for that sort of work will not bind him to the law of karma there's
alternative to this way for a man that's the only way to live in this world without getting sucked down this is like the rise of the New Testament New Testament you need are the animals taken care of the birds taken care of the dealers in New Testament commonalities cuz scuba Jesus a chance you don't shut the so that you know once someone ask someone was getting married one of Papa's disciples is getting married and so they asked for but you know what is the duty for a household there was a duty for a married couple do you know what he said
 he said and he said this in the concert I would like he's speaking to some kind of figurative waves old he said before every meal you should go outside of your house and call if anybody's hungry we're happy we have food right now if anybody's hungry have food
they're not responsible for providing for the community that needs it nor the senior sees their the Baggers so you know but when you're in that position where you get the most facility for material enjoyment for sex for money for the Comforts of home
 that's exactly when you're supposed to turn your attention to taking care of others
 that you are the ones that are generating the wealth and you're the ones at that stage of Life they need to kind of provide for anybody in need in a problem I think is it even here in this commentary are probably uses the term or he says I want to pretend this commentary he says that like householders are like he uses the word communist
 what is a communist but you know I think again like the way the proper use the word like communist is
right leg what does it mean to commune Mary could you look up the word commune
 but you don't know the words thinking not in terms of like I'm an island right we we we we sing Okinawa to make money when I buy my own house and do my own thing so I don't have to deal with anybody know know know when you're in that position you have to start to think of everyone else and how you provide for them
 alright commune let's see definition want to talk over or discuss definition to the smallest administrative District too many countries especially in Europe I think we need a verb communicate intimately
 to communicate intimately yeah that's one more does it have anything to do with with Society
 I don't see it in this definition
 noun
what is the verb hear
 Complex Community or message Bordeaux is Beats us come together communicate Community come together
 can come together Community yeah
 death
 what else we got Merriam Webster
 to receive communion to communicate intimately
 you know I think you know I'm not finding the definition that exactly looking for Bud Light
 it has to do with community that you're thinking in terms of community residence Inc in terms of individually so in that sense of Communists is one whose awareness is is focused on the community on the broader group rather than their own individual concerns so when you be
householder the ideas at this stage in life you didn't have to worry about this as a barometer and you won't have to think so much about this in your retired life but when you're the guy making all the money and when you're the guy that's enjoying the pleasures of you know sex and money and the Comforts of home and all that and you're meant to be focused on the community and making sure that they're all provided for sooner is working for yourself when you're working but you're working for everyone else and that's about to come up in the next few days
 dial Emma says I comes from the Latin word communis common to share the general public and share General Public

getting a steady message of simplicity
 and caring for others that this is you know being deeply spiritual thin
 but being a parent like you do materially expert externally
 and caring for others I think there's more on that in text 11
 dogs are mentioned a couple times dogs following persons Untouchables including dog-eaters should all be maintained with a proper Necessities. Take care of the dog you got to take care of the dog eater but don't take care of the dog eat if I give him a dog to eat a dog's wish you was but don't think like that okay dogs falling person.
including the dog intercondylar be maintained with their proper Necessities accept dogs which should be contributed by householders even one's wife at home with whom what is the most intimately attached should be offered for the reception of guests and people in general offered meaning that
 we're both in this together like serving to take care of this now that you're my wife and you serve me it's like we're together we serve Society
 text Will one so seriously considers one's wife to be his own that he sometimes kills himself for her or kills others including even his parents or his spiritual Master teacher in dark hair spent two such a wife he conquers is
a Sonata. It was never conquered by anyone. Okay so in other words every attachment of our family has some not be seen as ours it has to be seen as
 we're passengers here are mine our thoughts are body should be used for God it's not in mine nothing is mine here is yet and this is what one might consider what they want to be there is more than anything right like my spouse is mine and saying if you can if you can Concord that illusory external need
 then you smoker Krishna what is jealousy births presents nothing of this world that actually your wife is Christmas so yeah she said that every time you're trying to claim her as yours you trying to steal from Krishna shooter like Krishna treat everybody that comes to you like their Christmas
children it's your treat your children that they're Christians children should your pets give me a call later in the doggie door Chief electrician watch one more verse cuz I think that'll wrap up the extra team through proper deliberation once you give up attraction to his wife's body
 Celeste has to be gone because that body will ultimately be transformed into small insects stool and Ashes there was usually step of it sort of like Shakespeare to write with food for worms Shakespeare would say what is the value of this insignificant body how much greater is the Supreme Being who is all-pervading like this guy you know you have to give up lust eventually you should maybe and maybe not going to happen today but you have to see down the line like lost will not ever be satisfied but you got to start working on it today you guys and you guys said that the body itself
jealousy the body for what it is and and and how they even the ideas of the pleasure of the body are fabricated in the mind we got to practice that we have to read when it's a practice Saturday and we have to read the Detachment as barometer is your trains you know what they like one of us at six different ways that one can like you know thinking about sex engaging in sex did you know I was like yeah I neither is growling and there's like six steps of sex life is a lie call man like I got to control myself to actually yell not just the action but even your mind cuz it's actually told me to go back to your mind is this the mind that's where the real Dipper is made and so I just saw a quote just yesterday from find your boo you don't like inspiring
 you could all out one of the ultimately the great kirtan leaders of his era and
but also like real inspiring renunciate you know and he just said you could I forget exactly how he said it but more less you said you can't have sexual fantasies and Christian at the same time you're going to be like one of the Oscar if you wanted if if it's Krishna you want if you want to reconnect with God that's got to be calm you're the sole desire that dominates your heart and so that means you know we let go of not even the activities of lust but the thoughts and that and that has to do with you know it sounds impossible because
 the atmosphere that were in in the way they were raised it just makes the mind go to sex all the time you know of us prefer men you know there's every time they look at a woman they're kind of just like you're a crude and doing it externally it's hard not to internally you know think of them in and you know what is sexual content
what what's the date for the real Yogi for the spiritualist for the box of Yogi they don't allow the mind to go there and you just kind of keep you just do not allow it
 and gradually the Mind surrenders you know that graduated my just says okay I guess I'm not allowed to go there anymore just like a dog gets trained yeah I guess I'm not allowed to go there anymore and you just kind of draw that line that will open up your mind in your heart you know to go deeper and deeper and deeper into this otherwise you just going to get fizzled out you know sometime
