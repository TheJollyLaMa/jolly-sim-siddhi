 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom the sages a daily yoga podcast with your host rocking off and co-host and Senior educator the bhakti center New York stupid ass welcome to show everybody
 welcome back today study the shoe my bag with some class yet because stupid and rishikesh at the kirtan festival we made it back to the farm
 and I said how are you guys today we're back to Recovery Group Meetings online today the men meet at
moon and the women meet at 2 and there's also a local meeting for people in Alachua and Nashville today how is the pier time festival going on I will you know your times Festival I'll tell you something tell me I don't know exact count so maybe we have a we have a special guest with us today so we thought let's bring him on the show forbidden will bring him out in a moment that's injured in the song and who's the main inspiration and founder and you know Visionary behind it all but I say that I would imagine it's about 300
 400 people that are attending every night something like that for people you know open very open for chanting and it happily Channing dancing getting fully full pull hard and participation of course you have super excellent kirtan L you have modified
Bonnie and Clyde in the South End buttery Hari for boys here and there's a there's a big hear times of the night in the presentations during the day and so yeah and the quality of the persad him that they serve as you know there's a big Feast for everyone at the end and its exceptional exceptional percent and then you know like every played has to be washed and you know that every there's so much to put down on it and there's so much to be done to do it right sure and I can see that I think we're speaking about this yesterday and said they were we that attention to detail right it's like the Love is in the details and I can see that this is something that that indigenous want me and I think he's instilled and in all the other participants that are putting it on this gifs into every detail and they're doing it right and when that kind of happened assertive
magic can happen when you when when you bring powerful spiritual energies like the holy name into that kind of very thoughtful kind of presentation boom that takes off so it's it's it's been beautiful to say people still go to rishikesh who's considered the the origin of yoga it's right in the back of the Congo it's very scenic but they come looking for God and what we have there in most of the situation is you know you have a few La shrooms and have a lot of people just sort of like trying to Pander that this is what it happened we've exported American yoga to India I saw the same thing as an authentic experience but unfortunately what they're going to get
turn yoga teacher teaching in India or these Indian yoga teachers were trying to get yoga Alliance certified and people just one not then take experience and how you get that authentic experience is from a bona fide parampara and see when it comes through and and and shows up in the form of kirtan the corner of Rashad in the court of in the in the form of transcendental knowledge people are touch moved and inspired and I just witnessed in these videos I was like yeah cuz I've been to Rishi caves and I've had people come up in the Miss a ton to say oh my God this is actually what I've been looking for I don't want to just go to some Cafe and have a green smoothie interesting that you said there were enough cuz this morning
 that's a sun was Rising you know it's kind of pretty cold here in the morning I'm I'm kind of grounded up it was you know I've carried this extra
molding around the whole five months I've been here like a couple of warm sweaters and I was like I never more than once but now I am glad that I have them yeah I go down there and do you know what is the sun's Rising I go down to the river and I'm sitting on the at the got and it's so you feel the connection to the all the stages of the past and then feel the gunga's even the breeze even the cold breezes feels like it's bringing spiritual energy answer but as I was walking down I got downright to the God and His saddle walked up to me know just like saffron clad very simple you don't look like he probably just got out of the river himself a few minutes ago and and he looked at me
 as I'm walking towards him and you he like the way that I was dressed just he he he looked at me and said this is this is the culture this you know this is because any says you're you're you're with the heart.
Krishna devotee I said yes he said to ask me about my lifestyle you know my diet and my son and I and in all these are things that you said yes this is and he was just sharing appreciation for sure the Power Pod that he wasn't compromising on these things he wasn't just trying to get followers and resent things that he was saying this is the real authentic yoga tradition do you want it I can give it to you and in this man could feel that somehow he felt it a little Indian and he could feel it and others that he's mad and I could see that and he was really pleased with that till I think interviewing a storm is representing she'll probably very well here with being Innovative in a in a presentation for The Happening event that's happening in in in rishikesh right now it's like fills out you know people are coming out of the Woodworks to the dive into it it's authentic
 at the same time is presented in a way that people can
easily understand it and participate in it so make sure we bring into doing this for me on and we're asking you to unmute now you have to press the oh yes well, her eyes except I think I'm very good while we thank you missing you missing you wearing India you know where India the same time together just different parts of the country and probably just do Criss-Cross than me but that's what am I strong desires to at least we we meet here at the airwaves we did have one wonderful meeting once we crisscrossed in honeydew Our member that meeting my us how to spell Sade far from here how's the festival going and how can I get there next year
 that's because you know I thought I did invite you this for your you may forget you've got many of the patients that's why I didn't want you to come so I think we should just build fulfill my desire I can see you from here and you can see me from there but the festival is going really good role in our fourth day today and
because people would say we could arrange for for 50 people every evening I think that's the magic that like you were saying this isn't authentic process it's what we call that you could do, it's the process for the age of Kali Yuga to chant the Holy Name just made simplified because my life is so complicated and something we can apply to our lives and becomes a self realized so I'll tell a process and the people who are coming or authentic spiritual Seekers something like nitroglycerin you know if they're sad example if they're both out and put your put them together and it's got a big explosion so this is kind of like I would say the Hari Krishna explosion in rishikesh and I think they have the proof of that is everyone who comes here without fail they are completely satisfied they walk away totally sack satisfied just today I also met a man who was here this morning and you said I came to Vishal cacia I knew it was a chakra a spiritual.
a place of spiritual energy in India and I came here looking for something and my first thought was the you know their issue case kirtan Fest and I found it but I'm not going anywhere else I'm just going to stay here there's a lot of things happening but yeah people it's I think it's natural you know it's it's a natural thing we're call st. George Harrison said one time at London you said everyone everyone everyone is a devotee of Krishna some people know it and some people don't so this is the natural way to become Krishna conscious in the age of Christ singing dancing some philosophy and delicious vegetarian food that's basically all you needed me I should call him and we're doing at the right place at the right time with the right people you know what's going on there it's a doll
fair you know we begin around 9 in the morning we have to start with the key or tan and then we have another kirtan we have to be a big hero sound L here then we have workshops we had a dance Workshop the other day we had a workshop on how to put a sorry on now I've got 3000 sarees hanging it on hangers just outside the hall the girls can come and they can put it on and they can keep it so that the stars are going like hotcakes yeah I got them all donated beautiful beautiful flower so they come in they pick us up early every day you can pick a side that are girls dress them before the face painting on for free on your phone you got a lot of it you can easily share it with others who were sharing like that workshops in the morning today motiva did a workshop how to play cards house
when did Kartel player can ruin the whole ClearTalk on the go to 10 at night every single person who comes and you know all the people that come they they learn about the artist serving the Divine serving the lord serving push-ups with a lot of help washing dishes and cleaning up and mopping it's like one big spiritual family here we welcome to visit family and and and and you know I was wandering around last night Mirage in just everyone may not notice it but because I've four years attend to things like this just watching to see all the different elements that it takes to make this work and I know it's a lot and I know how challenge that challenging that is to pull off and you've all come to you know it it's just
going to be sad about when we come together in without ego everybody in the mood to serve two to help others to give and when it comes together really smooth like that I never was in that mood you just it creates the spiritual World it creates an atmosphere that's very different than what we normally do and you'll feel it and it's very special and it radiates in it excites I want to wake something up in their heart and you really have have done that in so many ways throughout your years of devotion service but it's still happening in really special ways at this Guitar Festival thank you thank you maybe you can help us with one other thing
 and that is Wii u r u i v we've always known you as someone with very special Devotion to the Avatar of Sri Krishna lord of the half man half lion
and his devoted servant little five-year-old for lot
 and it just so happens that today and I mean for weeks but we've been reading the 7th Canto and today we're and we're getting to these really great versus like right now in the show venom captain of the snow report in. I think today we're going to read about you know chewing the chewed and and so on could you share with us I know something that you meditate on everyday is provides Devotion to to learn if you could you could you sure maybe a little bit of your thoughts about the movie beginning with pearl odd and then maybe a little bit download Machining
 I think the baggage on seven counts it was very interesting because it gives us a picture of a non-dividing more than another body of materialist and we would say in a sewer or a demon it's interesting that in the block of a piranha
which is just about purity boat rental service we find an Asura like here in the car she poop with the bad guy so when I first became a devoted I was wondering why is a bad guy and and the bog what time describing his ass Erick tendencies in a book like the like the bug of a piranha like the box with Tom it's all about purity emotional service love of God grace St Louis person's mr. Gilligan's why does he run your coffee poop but then I figured out this gets a story's entwined with his son prolonged Mirage who's a devotee of this number of Krishna in fact he's one of the twelve great Authority on the science of bhakti devotional according to the walkathon to go to the 12th grade so why does you know this there too inclined as father and son so why is that because the bottom is letting us choose which
Kathy wants to follow you want to follow the path of materialism which you know is best exemplified by here on the couch with pool because he had everything and he had it now but he wasn't using it in the service of God he had no intention of acknowledging the existence of God so he was the perfect materialist and prolonged Mars was the perfect devotee of the Lord and you know by reading the story by here in the past time you get to understand I I want to be by like prolonged Maharaj because he was a saintly person he was peaceful he was So Satisfied he was experiencing extra scene is loving relationship with Krishna grassy run across to prove he had everything but he had nothing he wasn't satisfied he was angry he was he was miserable he was an autocrat he was punishing and hurting other people so
 it came to the point where the father was so envious of the happiness
the sun being a devotee of God he wanted to kill him
 is a 5 year old boy who tried in every way to kill his son out of envy and anger osetra but you know the little boy fell on his only weapon was his faith in God and he was praying constantly as they were trying to torture him and kill him and the Lord Krishna will we all know how beautiful Christian is threefold ending form shamasundara long wavy hair his eyes to a lotuses like like notice flowers to his ears his lips red like bimbo through his teeth are like rose and produce waves as he plays a flute he became angry seeing his devoted being persecuted so he took an appropriate for me took the form of half man lying it's a long story it manifested that form is half mad lion and he came down and he saved
 is the voting
Lord etcetera same one Incarnation for 12 voting that's how merciful the Lord is one Incarnation 41 devoting that's that's the essence of the shows how much the Lord actually loves his devoting and there's a beautiful prayer in the hurry back to you sooner die is 1429 where we see or just finger Dave speaking and this is what he says although I'm eternally liberated I am Bound by my devotees ropes of love in this way although I am a cheetah unconquerable I become Vita Concord buy them my devotees and although I cannot be controlled by anyone had become fully controlled by them by their love love is reciprocal pull off mirages perfect examples of pure Divine lover of God
 and the Lord so much loved him that he came to this earth and and he delivered have just like interest
we hear that the lord gave his beloved Son gets so much loved the world he gave his beloved Son Jesus Christ so it's repeated in the world in boxing and your dad came just for this one to go deeper alarm hours to save them from the dangerous and brawl in a similar situation in the grips of this material nature padam padam yard. There's danger at every step so as we proceed in the path of devotion we ask Lourdes finger Dave to protect us protect us from the enemies within obstacles to pure devotion like lust anger and greed and to protect us from the dangers of the squirrels we have enough time and our short lives to become pure devotees of Christmas

elementary school together then junior high school together and they're all sports minded in there on the football team and they were state champions in the football team and it was just during Vietnam and they all said you know what lets you know do the right thing and support our country and they all signed up for the war in Vietnam you know you were confused about what to do but they all came of age let their whole football team always best friends that I grew up with them from childhood joined and they picked him out exclusively and said okay you were going to make you a sniper
 and the rest of you guys going to send to Vietnam so he got special training but he he was like can I go with my friends to know it's like you but immediately all his friends got killed
 they all died in one battle in one battle immediately and he was devastated and imagine
what that does to you it's like losing people that you love that you grew up with and it just set him and and in such a condition they just said you know this is this guy be can't even send him because he's too damaged already and so he ended up getting released and that I think propelled is spiritual Pursuit and I think sometimes those tragedies and some people talking to me right now people are going through their own personal tragedies right now let those tragedies be the the trampoline that Springs you high and your spiritual life a lot of times we hear these stories of people getting high on their spiritual life or really zeroing in on their spiritual Pursuit let those tragedies not various let them have a spring us forward on their spiritual trajectory so yeah I love this man he's is great soul and wherever he goes he's creating a festival of the holy name and really spreading these ancient
that people are going to India to look for we don't have to feel like I feel like going on the Indian the side but huddling up until listen don't make the green smoothies that you don't have to go Goliath certified all we want is spiritual truth don't met don't ban for our crazy whims just give what India has always offered for millennium that's what we're hungry for
 all right do you have to figure everything out
 Prime Minister Modi let's have a meeting I got to talk to you
 all right Bubba we could do the Nugget we do the Nugget I want to pay it with you I know it sounds weird out of contacts using contacts that makes sense I want to bathe with you take a morning bath with you that sounds weird
 intelligent I want to take the morning bath with the stew
it got away but I haven't been bathing exactly in the morning when I go down there in the morning not bathing it's really cold down there you know what that breathing star your said he's took it all from India also by the way I've been bathing more like 11 or 11:30
 when is little Sonic still at very cold you know what but it's it's temporary and it's wonderful and you know you didn't give you pick up in this mess he quoted something stupid quoted something to bring me that you will not succumb do you know that the breezes from the ganga are enough to purify the Consciousness. I was I went down this morning I met that one felt like I got a little blessing from him and then I sat down there's this one tree that's growing out of the bathing got there and it in the whizzer so happy that I sat right next to that tree just hoping is going to like block the wind a little bit you know yeah and and I just sat there and
I took in to mind your and my you know conviction no more inattentive chanting focus and and I with that conviction I felt like I wasn't just doing what I had to do but I was part of the yoga tradition sitting on the banks of the ganga in rishikesh in Focus meditation you know in any feel like
 you're not only feel like you're part of that tradition but you feel like you're being supported by that tradition you feel like you're in your you know just like in bicycle racing or even car racing you know you get behind someone in the equate that draft
 Yeah Yeah and and you get pulled by the momentum of those that have come before you you sure the Quran yeah yeah and yogurt simply by remembering the great Souls before we get caught up in the draft and in a place like this it's so easy to remember them so I sat there and I just chat
send and I really sometimes the breezes were cold and sometimes I don't know what to do with the breeze felt warm
 it was like changing you know and I know and I was just and was also realizing this tree
 has a surprise me with in here for a couple hundred years or something like that and and in so many Saturdays have common touch this tree sat under the shade of the tree meditated by this tree everything feel special everything store has its connection to that Center in a very profound way it makes my it's making my time here just super and Rich to you know the super enriched you do use that analogy yesterday of the Trader Joe's bathroom how in the Trader Joe's bathroom in Albany that's a picture of where Trader Joe's is
 but what it was like you know 75 years ago and it there were these beautiful farms and back that it was really easy to remember this is Farmland you know this is a Shaker Village this is these are simple
houses that these are barns that we're here in silence over here so yeah India is getting covered but but taking shelter in this here Town Festival taking shelter the ganga and that's what I do when I take a trip to Russia case I isolate people we go to our hotel which is right on the back of the ganga and then we warmer there in October at the ganga you know we have your tongue at the gun got you can't even see anything else except the jungle and then we do go into the town of Rishi case it's it's overwhelming it's like going to Trader Joe's and so are the cafes and there's nothing the shopping and we just say okay now we're going to sit at the ganga and we're just going to sing and that Holy Name protects us you know what I mean and that's why it's important to have teachers in our life and make the festivals like this because we go in and all of a sudden were shepherded the shepherd into it a safe place where you can re-enter into what it was like
 millennium
Millennia ago years ago when you felt the shelter of Blue Ruin you felt the shelter of the Holy Name when you felt the shelter of a wisdom culture when you feel like this is a pilgrimage I just like okay I'm here and that's a beautiful architecture and they are the same junk that we think about the same stupid things I want someone to say give me a coffee
 now we have a little Koruna 10 years old here staying there today she took a cold shower and it was cold for you breathing in her life but she said but it felt great after Corona I was with Corona when she's taking her cold ganga snan down and in my poor Corona we got to bring up to her to reschedule it's a lot colder
call Taqueria practicing for next year you're practicing
 okay, stupid how are you doing today did you already did okay tomorrow double it twice you're at the gun got there there's no reason
 gobble come on my double if I doing it today that was like twice you know now it's twice and then we'll do it again tomorrow that would be a 50% increase
 are we going to do the Nugget you want do the Nugget
 I didn't notice so maybe I did listen to Listen to run fire today
where's a good spot to hit it before the conquest what should I expect the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Ryan Ricci the super most human being until Mother's hotspot to the goddess of learning and she'll be off today of the author I bet you she came here to rishikesh right just probably Wanda Arana Ryan read one of them or two of them never came down here of course she did or they made it
 they the way they did when they were always together they were inseparable for him by the tumor they want we don't know the other two there to just mention is one
 I would just come on
 that's the previous about Reese Unity embargo with Celia
and my running service with a two bodies all that is troublesome the heart become erratic Aiden and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise a trans gentle songs we established as an irrevocable fact, two more industrial at their Lotus feet reading for the shoe box guitar and of 7 chapter 5 text 23 to 24 and we're driving into the airport and just stupid was giving highlights of these purports when I was sitting with my hands folded tapping my fingers together excited about the nine process is a devotional service ever mentioned by little boy a lot
 and you can wear up to number six which is abundant on which means Mara
okay so one day offering prayers are going to assume Porton right here's what probably is some sort of what he wrote about although prayers are part of DD worship right because all the all the items are offered with prayer they may be considered separately like the other items such as hearing a chanting and therefore separate statements are given here with the Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities in opulence has
 a man who feels influenced by the Lord's qualities in various activities offers prayers to the lord it's it's almost spontaneous it sounds like red like if you if you get moved you feel influence Shirt By The Lord's quality time influenced by your compassion influenced by your beauty I'm influenced by your
then you naturally speaking Indian actually speak you know the the the more you're in tune with it the most like poetry in this way one become successful that's all it takes just a little just a little opening up of the heart but you know right I I you and I have said this quite a few times on the show that when we read the Bible time years and years ago we were more following the plot
 right now I'm looking for the plot it when it gets to a place where someone just offering prayers for 30 pages were like okay skip this part of the plot is really just setting up these prayers and all of the rich information is right in these prayers I like the way you end the plot is setting up for the prayers yeah yeah frame it without you no end and we approach God and
most religions you here off of Alvin times and most of Hinduism was well-known excluded it's all like I need help please help me I'm in my love life is devastated I'm sick my brother say someone's dying I'm dying and I'm starving I help me get a better house I'll be going to but it's just petitioning God for Stuff help you no good marriage help my son whatever it is but sometimes you get to this point and you do especially when you read these past times were you just want to appreciate God I'll text you when it's supposed to get that with equal. Some people can go to the Grand Canyon be like this is beautiful nature is beautiful Earth I feel great gratitude and what I'm doing in my life but I know when we practice these prayers
 you know which to be do mean there have been doing since we've been doing Pooja together just practicing founded on these prayers after the pools you sit and the reason prayers you bring some prayers to you
read some prayers to go over down three some prayers to bring burned oven and do them almost like Anna to try to develop that appreciation but then the appreciation starts to take over and then when you're acting yamuna go over it on your inborn. When you catch a prayers and you like yes yes yes it is not only about I need this help me with this I'm suffering like this although that will come out but it's almost like if every time I see you can still wish I could borrow $4, Kramer and I'm coming over to been through stuff and don't be Kramer to God
have some appreciation and we develop appreciation by hearing about the Lord hear my the Lord's pastimes singing the kirtan singing the Lila kirtan you know the pastimes of Krishna and then we just can't help but appreciate God I love it right you know his innocence would come here in for me right now is we always have to be looking for what is it what now do I have to
 where where now do I have to take it to the next level and if you and I were just speaking yesterday I think it was one both of us were saying enough of this inattentive chanting we've been doing them in 35 years we can no longer tolerate this anymore from now on we do not do that it makes me sick to my stomach I feel nauseous if I'm not going to move forward right and that a little bit of that self-disgust you know
I know you're beautiful tell yourself you're a little bit of like I'm sick of where I'm a sick of it. I'm sick of it off in a little bit of this a little bit of that little bit of this was coming over with a back to my car read a little bit of that and then we just said let's read the box with Tom the balk of a time is where it's at let's sit and read the back with him everyday that's how this whole podcast started that up and you get sick I've been in this game for a while and I still can you know I'm at where the deputies I put on the T lock I and I go to the Cure times but let's get serious about this facet and why not go right to the seed right to the colonel right to The Fountainhead right the right to the spring source which is the Holy Name everything comes from this okay and since so what you're saying about prayers are we have to elevate our prayer we rather than asking for things we need to as probably saying here
I need to feel influence by the Lord qualities in various activities very sexy jazz music is Lila what he does have to read about in the baggage we need to feel influence by that and then we'll Spot Will begin to offer either reading the present or they're in the Box have been feeling them ourselves sure or also speaking our own words and opening up our relationship with God so that it's not just a theoretical thing we talked about but actually talk to each other and it's not like one has to exist without the other you can still ask God for stuff for help you can still ask God for stuff but just don't let them be disgusted with yourself pointed to it yeah but but but add those add those traditional prayers because those train the mind of had a thing and then also speak heartfelt prayers and then if you have to petition God for something by the way I can you throw me a little something on the
all right is when is the next practice processor devotional service number 7. Do you know this is something that
 in our world
 that you and I grew up in drug yeah we can lie we didn't like our teachers very much we loved our team house in school school now you weren't like anti
 teacher it is a teacher and there was nothing there that was inspiring us you know and
dumb and in general we don't like the idea of having to do we consider to be the served is better than being a servant well it's not that you can't speak for me I did like my teachers I just didn't know where it was all going like what is the point to become very educated what's the win is it just to Make a Better Living than the guy who's not studying harder that that's all it's not like I dislike them or I just like you I just felt like where we call this well here's a here's where I'm going with that is that the idea to serve the idea to be even the menial servant
 to us it can sound repulsive is like that's what you don't want to happen to you a lot if that's why you got to go out and make a lot of money so you don't and don't have to be the serpent and you don't Americans also hate the hate the concert
volume down down down. Never back down and show them respect the formerly like that is an absolutely do you know if you think about it we bow down so much more than the ordinary people like a hard time so it's so but here the ideas if there's someone that you deeply respect and deeply loved yeah there is a joy in serving that because that's the expression of your love love is a wonderful feeling to have and when you have that love in the within the context of I see you as my Superior Ice I love you with respect
 then to that that right there is called that that's a that's a particular Russia that's a particular Flavor of Love in the seventh one. Your means to love God
in that in that that particular variety I love you as a servant loves the one that they they hold dear in their heart so this is part of a proper rice is very wholesome is very satisfied you know that that you can even see just a little bit and I'll talk with him to do his finest like we've respected for so many years you know how I felt when I walked into that you know I came in late the day I arrived here in rishikesh and it was a rainy night and I went out to that.
 And I went out to that gangaputra and I came in late you know who out of the rain into that room of 400 people Channing and ecstasy and enjoy doing this for me sitting on the other side of the room
 and I just looked at him up there and in my heart I felt it
appreciation for him that look at you you were my senior monk where are you are you are the friend of my group who I serve like in who I will love him I was a servant and yeah I see you with that with a similar type of respect which is part of the etiquette of our of our lineage right and and and I and I relished that feeling of there was a joyful loving feeling in my heart that said
 look at him I'm so happy that you know he's maybe 75 now or something like that and he's so loving uncle uncle yeah yeah. That's that's something of dust you know what can I do for you when I when I when I bow down to you I feel good in my heart when I stand up with folded Palms I feel good in my heart that's that's that that's there because it's a rest of their you know to to have someone in your life that you deeply respected and loved that way short
one can love God that way and so proper right Siri says there is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord is a servant
 after many many thousands of birds when one comes to understand that he's an eternal servant of Krishna one can deliver others from this universe
 what if you just have that
 you think you can you can give people something so much about it if one simply continues to think that he is eternal serving of Krishna even without performing the other processes of devotional service and they can attain full success for simply by this feeling
 want to perform all nine processes that emotional service just this feeling I love you as you're serving me like it cuz scuba the problem is
 what you're saying makes no sense most people most people don't even have the map don't even have the map that there even is a map

 right but even though you're full and you're Indian in your bliss you you become the friend of all the the residence for David how fortunate are these devotees
 profit rights in the statement the word friend quote on quote
 is specifically used in Kate intense love friendship therefore is better than servitude in the
a job of Dos cerveza the devote accepts the Supreme personality got it as a friend this is not at all the astonishing for one of the vote is in who is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the DD diminishes as spontaneous love for the person of the gutted manifest so so I no longer doing this ritualistic practice to bring my mind to certain people cuz my mind's already on that platform and I'm relating to God With Love is a friend love that you know it's a great concept that God is actually your friend

Syros of the door except the Supreme personality got as a friend this is not at all astonishing for one of the vote is pure in heart the opulence of his worship indeed of the DD diminishes as a spontaneous love with a personality got to manifest in this regard sridhar Swami

 Life After Life may I be connected with Krista in this friendly attitude what else the field I don't need anything more I just need Christmas my friend and I will see if the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds and the old North Wind begins to blow I'll come on you'll hear me knocking on your door that we got just want me to leave when we read the 9th one almond
 are you are you frozen sir
 I'll read up and abandon him and he'll come back okay I'm going to be in the more I can read the rest of these lyrics
call Mary you're on now ready I'm going to be the word opulent bed and refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activity only to please the Supreme personality got it such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master
 when cared for by its Master a cow is not an anxiety over and spanked in its such a cow is always devoted to its master and it never acts independently but only for the Masters benefit you by the way we were just in India and
 Americans are like he how old is cows in the street there often times these cows are not roaming they're they're actually cared for but they let them out but a bill
has built up around the pasture and so now they're just going into the street they do their thing in the day but they all come back at night just like like through the chickens come back to their roosting to the cows come back and are cared for so yeah and especially if they have an affectionate relationship with their master and I tell that story about my friend do you stuff a cow
 who gave milk have one cat but the cow gave milk for like 13 years just cuz he just felt like all this this guy is dependent on me too and he loves me and that was the relationship such a cow is always devoted to its master and it never acts independently but only for the Masters benefit some devotees make sure cuz too busy trying to get in okay some devotees therefore considered dedication of the body to the Lord to be at motivated them and a stated in the book known as bhakti Vivica sometimes dedication of the soul of soul to the Lord is called APA Nevada.
best examples of automobiles are found in Bali Maharaj and I was fully surrender and that's when the time came in the form of the dwarf a little person and he took three steps of land in Bali Mirage has surrendered everything to the Lord and of course I'm barrese Maharaj who was he was trying to please the Lord and then you ended and because he was fasting and he was not he took a glass of water to break his fast and your boss got really angry he went to curse and he threw the fireball at ambareesh but Lord Vishnu was also very supportive about Maurice cuz he was a devotee he's giving Amber he's even though he was a king
 and you don't you think of a king they have lots of quotes stuff but everything that he had
add
 he offered to God we don't care if you have stuff in the material world do you say stuff won't make you happy but sometimes people in a position they get born into a family feel a lot of stuff where they have a career a lot of stuff in this world generally they only keep the stuff that really significant to them but the idea is whatever stuff yet have you just use it in service of the Lord and it purifies your stuff
 last one sent his last name is also sometimes found in the behaviour of group me need a b
