Yoga and soon to be posted on the list of the sages., find me which case I do know we got to see all these removing removing you know there's that there is a sweetness of do both you know what you know what cuz she was means is like we're going to all these places when I just a one place and just chill and that that there's something to be said about that to you can go sometimes you can go very deep but I think it's for people are going to India it's good to sort of see what India has to offer I know a lot of it is kind of old as you can find some cheap nice place to stay in for nobbin and just
make much more money doing it that way but it I really want people to have this experience so they they get understanding of spiritual India and the culture of Bendy and the culture booked it because when you go to Rajasthan and see the culture of bhakti there there's something that moves you and when it when you see bhakti within its context of of of the old temples of India and so I'm there's something powerful especially in Northern India like that all right I'm looking forward to it I am up to my

That was really nice it was not only was like the setting cool but somehow survive in there was very high
 it is right and I'm thinking of doing the program that I did in my home maybe just making that a yearly oh well if you were using your retreat at that time so we'll see
 I don't know a part of me wants to just join the festivities cuz it that it seems like the New York extra has turned it into a whole festival in it
well that was the previous night right. Thursday night was accurate on Friday night was my place Saturday was rathyatra today's Brooklyn Temple
 I know she's unbelievable what happens tonight in Brooklyn for all the people in the area it's like all day cuz I starts at noon and it goes into the night it's just like a kirtan mela thing you know you're my God you guys got to go to your local just go to that you'll lose your mind it's worth it tomorrow show 6 a.m. and we're going to interview him about the book that's but everyone take note that's at 6 a.m. tomorrow to 6 a.m. people out there

 we get that up on the the calendar the new wisdom of the sages in calendar
 I look at Stephanie Berman she's there and it'll leave I just
 kicking back at Phinney Berman we love you see you at the Gladys Knight you're looking glamorous this look at
she got probably one of those
 orange looking drinks that everybody has over there he's in Puglia Italy okay Amelia buenos dias it's truly touching to see the impact it has on people's lives a question recently came up in my monthly study group from Ecuadorian yoga teacher it's a very interesting one and a couple has a thing called
 call the what is it called again
 possible my mind Sanga Sanga Sanga yoga teachers but for anybody and it's like she just gives you new content like
your teacher you want to share some con she gives you like really content and it involves like a an exercise and everything to good stuff
 well question recently came up looking Beyond Simple cause-and-effect what is the true essence
 a Karma
 how can we transcend creating, and how does this connect to past lives and some Sarah looking Beyond Simple cause-and-effect you do this you get that what is the true Essence likewise it there how can we transcend creating, and how does this connect to past lives and some Sarah very interesting you want you want me to build bake a cake and you frost it.
we create, every time we breathe every time I blank every time we are you know should I go to the bathroom so I go to Kitchen every action we do create some type of reaction to hear people say things like man imagine if I didn't go left but I went right to go to the store and if I went cuz if I went left there's a massive car accident what would that have hit what I would I've been that car accident and we always think like well if I didn't marry this woman to marry this woman or what if I didn't have that child and have this child or they know if I didn't have this woman I wouldn't have that child wear with a child of ended up like lost in this idea but yeah you don't never think like that kind of like like like if I was never married and never had my children or what I've had a different child and if I procreate and then the next day you know what I mean it would have been a whole different version of a baby crocodile
 I think things like that on a regular picture
every little Choice little Choice gives you some type of reaction
 now of course it's happening within the realm of this world of cause and effect that is set up almost like an incredible machine where God is of course overseeing it like the like the owner of the the factory so to speak but sort of detached it sort of going on by our Free Will and by the higher management of the machine so to speak which of the demigods now when it comes to when it comes to Krishna Consciousness and of course that gets played in that with our past what we did last year last month or in it in our childhood which is creating a you know how we were treated the family we were born into that's creating our choices today I mean sometimes we are haunted by some trauma or by some positive experience that's following us
to assist us in our choices today but sometimes we can't help getting out of our own way because we've had something that hurt me people have hurt me people left me I can't trust people nipple right I choose bad people in my life presently and sometimes things have gone very wrinkled free in this life and then even in a previous life that seems like we're making so many good choices in this life you see people like that so we are followed around by our past and in every good way and every horrible way and hopefully we'll stumble upon a bona fide yoga system it assist us to make a choice outside of our normal programming to just so you know cat instead of making a bad choice which I do a lot instead of making just a good choice I'm going to make God's choice I'm going to make what is the choice Don wants me to make right there certain toys I can make
good for me that make material sense like I'm going to marry this person I'm going to move to this place and invested in this type of real estate there like good smart level-headed choices then there's bad choices we make them all the time everybody not told me not to date this guy and I'm going to date them anyway cuz I love them you know or you know we just so you know who squander our savings on something cheap and fun or get into debt bad choices but there is something Beyond good and bad and that's called transcendental and that's where that's what's happened to all of us somehow a spiritual realm has entered into our life as giving us a Transit Dental Choice it wasn't just a good choice for a lot of us yesterday to go to near Rocky Archer like we'll need a cool place it's a fun place it's a cultural City let's go to New York like that's where would be a good choice you know when I can stop by
enjoy the place and then leave
 we actually made a transcendental Choice people have people were from well-to-do backgrounds established professionals they came around and they sat on the ground on a mat
 all day in the Sun and sang songs it was sort of like not a material it was like the materially best thing you could do but it was we all felt very uplifted and inbliss etcetera so those spiritual choices start to change their call it's called you got a material choice of karma or V, that means a positive reaction or a negative reaction and then you have what's called a Karma choices where you are doing actions that give you no reaction and what we're trying to do in bhakti on a regular basis it was returned to insert Krishna into our thoughts into our very breath into our actions into our hearts
is minds and into our workplace and a lot of you been in this path you realize this isn't an hour and a half on Sunday we don't want you for an hour and a half on Sunday we want every waking moment of your life Christian everything of you he wants you to be fully reconnected that when you're having a great day or Krishna when you're having the worst day of your life you want Krishna when you just won the Olympics in your hands in the art are they putting a gold medal around your neck. Krishna Krishna when you are got chronic illness you going Krishna right when you're getting married Krishna when you get a divorce Krishna whatever it is Krishna is it a pumping through your heart 24/7 once we get to this point where every thought every breath all of our good qualities are engaged in Christmas service
 Christmas no longer app
it's part of our breathing it's part of our heartbeats part of our thoughts and at that point even though we're driving somewhere we drive somewhere I don't know if you've ever if you ever wash the car you're you're killing that chilling on the you get karma for everything you're killing this world that's just partying out over again I said nowadays you noticed that I could use to be to go out drive in the summer and your your whole bumper would be full of bugs and stuff like that it's not like it used to be really think about it you said I'm all over your windshield and everything like why don't you anymore is there a bug something's going on with the bees and the insects in the chemicals in that all that stuff will you come wash my car next time you're up here going to get snow off your lawn you're killing toads frogs so many things going down just to exist in this world we are creating bad, but when we start engaging everything in the service to Krishna
everything's becomes a karmic no reaction and therefore no reaction means no material body even if you do everything wonderfully there still a positive reaction and that means taking birth again you get a Pious birth but it still means a birth and bhakti we were over birth and death were over some Sarah we want all our choices to be Krishna choices choices connected to Bremen are spiritual life and transcend the gunas and therefore there is no more material reaction for fractions
 cuz Diva the sticks are bomb so it's kind of like this world's the material world ever and it's kind of like a big virtual reality and we could get lost in it forever if there were
you know if if certain if certain programming wasn't downloaded and installed in it and part of that is a lot of karma that's one of like the programs in the material world and it has its purpose is kind of like the cosmic sensitivity training aspect you have the material world and in the idea being that our nature
 is to serve with love
 we kind of turned away from that to enter into the virtual reality of this world but so that we you know their qualities that are consistent with
 that mood that devotional moves you know qualities of generosity and kindness and sensitivity to other people and so on it when does the law of karma is a trained you to think and act that way when when you just consequences now cuz you know it was a virtual reality with no consequences we could just keep doing what we ever we wanted it we could go down the wrong path forever
 because his car
prices to the actions it's kind of rewarding
 Behavior that's consistent with one's nature
 and it's it ain't on it's kind of like that the cosmic penal system for correcting Behavior that's inconsistent with our nature you know cruelty and callousness and miserliness in things like this is going to make you feel the pinch
 into it so it's it's working in that way and The Vedic the ancient Vedic texts they speak in depth about this and they also show here's a path of if you want to enjoy this world if that's if that's where you're at then we can show you how to how to call to make good karma and enjoy the good things in this world than that they're still going to be death in there still going to be paying and that's the way this world works but there is a way to kind of manipulated as best you can but as we're going to say and it's like we're not interested even would definitely not interested in experiencing Bad Karma
getting that you know painful results and in the wiser people
 are still not even interested in cultivating Good Karma they would they want it like you said this is Transcendental playing of action called a Karma and it's a bug of agita that really speaks to the you know this is there's different types of different kind of pads of yoga you know how to yoga there's a hot yoga pradipika you know for stronger yoga there's time do the yoga sutras and Uncle yoga and they all did they only have two different authors in text that they're all kind of grew out of the you know The Vedic teachings you know if Jocelyn's works but when it comes to Karma Yoga the place where you go is actually the bug of agita itself and that's like that's what you find a bug of agita
 is has so many excellent
teachings on Karma Yoga how to move through this world and not get entangled by karma that's why I like so many to where I like business books about our business because it's got so many practical teachings about how to live in this world and not get entangled in and how not to get entangled a lot, let's work on that all Karma level it has a lot to do with what with knowledge in the Detachment that's born in the clear knowledge and so there's several places we could read from the Bible to get to the speak to this but you know part of the question was if I go back with see how can we transcend creating Karma
 okay it is so that's let's just read a few verses you know this is from Bhagavad Gita 5th chapter I'm sorry fourth chapter
 you know we have that first right for 18 remember this run last one who sees action and action and inaction in it and in action yeah that's a real confusing one
what is he's in action in action and action and inaction this was my entire explanation I basically teased out this verse is first in a very sort of a simple way but go let's make this a little easier and send one who sees action within a shy one who sees in action with in action
 an action within inaction is intelligent among men that means another one who sees in action with an action you can be active in this world and get the inactive on the karmic level you're not getting anything back right that that's that's the I just sold one who could see in action in action and action and inaction is Italian among men and he is on the transcendental plane that's what drug another speaking about although engage in all sorts of activities
 you know Arjuna was thinking not so much and he's thinking what if I'm going to get Bad Karma if I do my duty
engage in this battle when I get bad karma for you
 and Christian said there's a way to act in this world where you're not accruing either good or bad, so he continues one is understood to be in full knowledge
 whose is it like you to to to know that all this way to cultivate Good Karma by performing rituals and appeasing the Davis that's knowledge oh I understand something about the background of how the world works but one is in full knowledge that they got deeper knowledge when there every Endeavor is devoid of the desire for sense gratification this world is not meant for me to enjoy that's not what this is all about her right that's not why I've been dropped in here just enjoy this place like no no no you got to do or you're here to learn you're in college okay if you want to call as you just saw it like you walked in the classroom you thought the place was meant for your joy your kind of like kicking back in the corner and you hear you're like you know
the teacher's desk and trying to figure out find something to enjoy that the hay this place isn't meant for you to enjoy this place for you to learn
 so one who is one is understood to be in full knowledge with every Endeavor is devoid of the desire for sex gratification that's the key that Detachment he has said by sage has to be a worker For Whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire perfect knowledge I understand what this world is understand who I am I understand what the purpose of it is abandoned you all attachment to the results of their activities
 I'm not doing this to get something for myself ever satisfied and independent
 he performs no fruit of action know, Quark although engage in all kinds of undertakings such a person of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled gives up all sense of propriety ship over their possessions and asks only for the bare necessities in life
that's working they're not affected by Bad Karma
 he was satisfied with gain with comes of his own accord
 and it was free from Duality and does not envy
 who is studying both success and failure
 is never entangle do performing actions the work of a person who is unattached to the most material nature and it was fully situated in transit on knowledge merges entirely into transcend this is exactly what the question you know it's going to know how can we how can we live in this world and transcend karma is all being spoken about right there that it has to do with a knowledge of understanding who I am and what this world is how it works letting go of the desire to make this world work for our sense of gratification and still be very responsible and active in the world but with that Detachment you can hit this plane called a Karma
 and the bug of agita just you don't you read from Bhagavad Gita ever
it's going to start to sink and more and more you going to kind of start to get it more and more and you take that into your life especially through devotional Krishna like direct direct of ocean I'm acting for you Christian not for me I'm acting for you that that that's on the transcendental plane and engine you free yourself from that in the cycle
 nice good cool question to all right let's continue on sir I saw this the other day from Anonymous this is from David Koch worth on the disc on the old Discord thread we had so many different platforms you would communicate with each other the new website that's the way they communicate now looking forward to it everybody settling into this if you haven't done it check it out within the pages.com a lot of beautiful people dedicated their time and their energy to create this entire new platform from wisdom of the sages check it out today
you not going to get all the extras yeah if you'd like to join up and support his head that the podcast is free to do what everybody every day for everybody for free if you want to support us cuz we need support to go forward and you sign up and it's really appreciated in those who have switched over from the Patriot platform thank you very much we're very very grateful so this is from David house worth and he says so I saw this the other day
 set here here's a quote most important spiritual growth doesn't happen when you're meditating or on your yoga mat
 I never thought my spiritual growth happen to my yoga mat and I guess people do it happens in the midst of conflict
 when you're frustrated and angry or scared
 and you're doing the same old thing and then I suddenly realize that
 I have a choice to do it differently I like that
you start to realize you have governance over how you react this is huge this is I think any deep thinker and a spiritual tradition they'll say that this is this is what makes us grow is Let's Make a different choice not the same old bad choice I used to be a road rager I used to be a you know I used to go right to fight or flight mode let me let me see it never works for me let me try a new way of being so David says I feel like this is a valid point but my question is when one finally realize that they can do it differently
 how is someone supposed to act or react when you're told you're being passive aggressive placating
 is that the other individuals Maya their own their own defusing you a placating the pink yeah it is is that they're that that it's that they're Maya to work out or is it still the approach of
individual who is trying to change their habits, their habits approach it is very hard it's a very hard thing when an individual has their own my workout I'm not sure no matter how much I try to change I'm still left with me I think I get where these going with this idea is instead of just like digging your heels in and going head to head in bucket bucket heads with people just trying to listen to them I feel like if you're actually empathetic and you actually want to hear a person they will know it another great reason why people could have pews us a being passive aggressive is someone times we don't say what we mean
 and sometimes we don't mean what we say
 and I'm getting this very common thing say what you mean meme
and it's sometimes hard because we don't want to hurt somebody's feelings will say it in a different way and it'll come up and very passive-aggressive
 and then sometimes when we don't agree with him at all and we're just trying to shut them up they will feel shut up and placated so when we are hearing them but doesn't mean we have to give up our opinion
 but we just say it when I hear you say I don't necessarily agree with it but I hear what you say I can understand how you feel that way
 I don't know if I'm hitting the nail on the head too stupid that's sort of my take away from the question correctly another words yoga is the real transformation is kind of grown out of the struggles that we have in life and so someone says yeah I need to dig in and I need to change my life and not you know where all the rubbing elbows with other people in the world and so sometimes when you get to people that are sitting too
in this world and one decides I want to change something in the relationship may change to write and sin navigating that can be challenging and I think what you're saying is right
 how you communicate in other words if you and I are sitting together and for 10 years together then suddenly I decide I want to change
 like I want to stop going to the pub I want to let you know that I'm going and you're right you know it could be challenging not to deal with it in a totally blunt way
 and even if you decide you know I don't want to be blunt then it's difficult not to sound condescending or passive aggressive or placating
 so so we we you know here's the thing we've got to we've got to transform we've got to have the courage
to make changes in our life otherwise that I'm just takes away and we just stay in this mediocrity human life's not meant for that it's just great opportunity
 we got to be willing to kind of like breakout you don't have the courage to break out and you going to be doing that with you know it in the the proximity of other people try to make that effort to communicate to them why you're doing what you're doing without being condescending and that can be challenging but do the best that you can write you do the best that you can and then that is and if they still can't appreciate what you're doing and the internet I think I also felt this coming from the question to you is kind of like
 is that the other how is someone supposed to act or react when you're being told these kind of thought you were head you're being passive aggressive your plate can is that the other individuals my to work out you know is everybody should I just say that's their problem he says it's a very hard thing you know dealing with this
you work we're all going to have to try to make these important moves these important ships are alive we can't allow others to Hold Us Down we have to have that courage we should try to do it in such a way we're being insensitive to others as possible as respectful as to others as possible let's be as respectful as we can be and if it and if they still can appreciate and they're still accusing us with a lot of that may be coming from their own insecurities I let you know or or their own ignorance and that can be hard to deal with yes it can
 and but you know what that's the point where you got to go to the thick skin and I feel like sometimes there's a there's a time for sensitivity and there's some time was just like well you know what this world isn't going to cuddle me this world isn't just going to open up the path to to transcend his for me like like it's a piece of cake I might have to fight my way out of town and not fight with that purse
necessarily but another words I'm going to have to buy some bullets in this world I'm going to have to say you know what this is tough in that in life is tough and but I'm still going to continue in that you know what I remember sometimes you and I talked about like our
 our experiences with Rod no swimming sometimes how he communicates to us without words
 and yet same recognize that goes to the sometimes you bring up the subject it's just inappropriate or something he just kind of looks the other way
 but I've also had times where I've started speaking to him with a with some with with with some measure of self-pity
 you know yeah Marge is really hurtful and so and so did yeah he did this to me like in some point he might entertain a little bit of that but at a certain point
you know he's not going to entertain it like when he feels like he hates it's time to time to Buck up kid you know who doesn't sit here complaining all day you know and I seen just change the subject instantly just like Ashley if you're like a person like you you're on the path you're really locked in you know it's not like you're going and you're coming up and you're just crying you're actually you know what we are sympathetic enough people going through pain but the same time the girls are supposed to lead you and not too and he's going to feel empathy he's not going to indulge you in your complaining and victimhood exaggerated mindset we're trying to commiserate yeah he's not a Jorge yes that's so even so like that in that case next time you share with me I'm going to be like you know what up son
the fact you know it is it's if we don't we will just we got to grow up we got we got yeah we got it just led a lot of the stuff I don't mean to be
 intensive with David by saying this but take it in to see if it applies you know see if it applies if it seems like yeah you know what you're right it is hard but what can we do we just do what's right there is really something to that stoic
 mindset
 you know this part of the Ana in a part of knowledge knowledge and attachment just saying the world's not meant to cuddle me I got a mission in life the whole world may be against me I'm moving forward and they did their strength and if we if we if we don't if if we allow ourselves to wallow in self-pity on any level we really slow down our progress and yeah
Chandler certain things that will trigger us you know I can't do that that's triggering can't be in this place as trigger I kept after if you got so many triggers after a while you're going to live in it you're going to live in a corner in a closet we got to we got to let things roll office like water on a duck's back before that water on a duck I've done this by the way you pour water in a duck it just beads off at rolls right off them when you went chasing after the thing with a couple washer I have these beautiful Ducks I usually just lay with slug eaters
 all right let's go Mom that's a great question and we're onto our last one here today from Dennis family Borg part of our community has a good question cuz I always thought about this question to said I was reading the Bhagavad Gita verse 2 2.34 to 2.36 in these verses Krishna says that leaving the battlefield 1
negatively impact the public opinion about Arjuna and here's the quote others will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only and dust they will consider you insignificant chicken chicken and he actually quotes me the body teachings we we emphasize the focus on our inner world as this is what we can control the externals are to be tolerated I think the public opinion is not within our control people loved people will love you and people will hate you and I will have nothing to do with you that's what do by rocket right now
 but that's the stoic mentality we were just discussing in the last question when discussing about the Archer last week rocket up inspired us to be totally aloof to public
in our spiritual practice right we're all sitting and singing totally alert the public opinion so how are we to understand this first can you please help me understand the instruction that Krishna gives is it that is it to consider the impact on the opinion of others when considering which action to take you know cuz this verse always stop that stop me to for the longest time because I felt like what a week are what do we care why is Krishna using this to go to Arjuna to move on so I just sort of like ignored it but at the same time when you're in a position like Arjuna who is a chetra he's the person like for example suppose I saw someone outside my window I was not supposed to be there in like hit the window I need to call worry about this the first thing is I love to this I'm just what people are doing with their lives now they're actually breaking into my home
 so there are people that we
when there's trouble right and they need to stand firm in the imagine if I did call a cop and a cop came and he's like whatever just let him do what he wants to do it's like you need people in place in an organized Society protect you two to look out for you whose someone is got your back we need that in different departments it in a civilized culture and if Arjuna who wasn't sure who was a warrior what who was who you would look look up to in such a sort of a vulnerable position you need to have them in place where they are firm and unmovable
 that's cuz Rock I'm sorry it's going on over there
 Herman unmovable
 what do you think about that
10 unusual very short just like 3 verses in the second previous to this Christmas speaking
 on the ganic level where I get some gear level he's saying we're not the body the body's temperature Souls Eternal it was like that kind of straight up you know Ava magana and then he switches a little bit and start to speak from a David apparently materialistic Viewpoint he says for things to Arjuna you ready for this argument he says he first thing he says you know what fighting this kind of battle
 it's like the Warriors they they actually welcome this because it opens the doors to the heavens wide open as far as far apart with them as far guitar Morgan bar the door to swarga that's what he had it set so like that's a totally that's like the but that's not the message of the bug of agita that's that message will find in the early beta switch Christian the bug you to say forget all that stuff
right but right now isn't it supported war or war and then he needs to go to higher material Level of existence and then he says and if you don't do it you're going to lose your reputation
 well that's a materialistic concern is big deal here or going to speak of your infamy they're going to consider you a coward and they're going to consider you insignificant what are you oh he's not at all concerned about this okay with that I want to be praised one day and I'm going to be criticized the next that's the nature of matter why should I get upset either way and then he sums it up by saying look Arjuna there's two possibilities here and they're both materialistic you can either attend the heavens or you can enjoy the Earth is a king so what do you complain about so why is he doing that you know and it's sometimes Arjuna was very confused
 and he was kind of like it's kind of like
right at the crucial moment he just started he just lost touch with his duty what should what's what's important for you to do right now right here Christmas speaking purely on the the platform of trying to inspire someone to perform their Duty not necessarily for the the best of reasons but for True reasons you know so he's realizing
 Arjuna doesn't seem I've been speaking on the level of of of Truth
 for about the past 15 verses or so and he's not responding so maybe I got to come down a rung on the ladder and just speak to him just on the level of Duty you were going to send it. I've been speaking to about the spiritual on the spiritual level if you're not going to relate to that I can tell you even from a material point of view it's better to do your duty then to avoid you duty but but then he switches very quickly you know
immediately he begins to shift it and he says
 do they'll fight this is the I don't understand why there's one place we get as it is with a kind of maintain this kind of like The Shakespearean The Bard Stephen Hunter Battlefield without considering happiness of distress the previous first he was saying consider happiness and just rest now he's saying actually there's a higher level of thing is you don't consider happens to distress you do because it's right don't consider happiness to distress don't consider lost or gained or Victory or defeat and by doing so at this it goes right back to the previous question and by doing so you won't get Bad Karma right you're acting now on the other, platform and he says that he says that's have described this knowledge to through the analytical study through something that meant the previous verses that were
you're not the body and these people are going to die I don't really die he says now listen as I explain it in terms with working without food results which you know it is speaking about booty yoga here or Karma Yoga he says oh Arjuna when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works so he brought him right back up to the level of Guiana right up to the level of of knowledge and now he's going to attack actually that Vedic materialistic View Point by saying you know what is a bobo guys who are you off or something you know those are bewildered by material things they never Chiefs timati which is what you what you're looking for piece you're never going to get it so it was it was kind of like an anomaly those verses you know that it was it was there truth in it but it's not the Deep message of the Gita there it was just an appeal to Arjuna to do your duty and sometimes we need to appeal to people on that level they can understand the deeper message so I think that's the way it's going to be understood
beautiful all right that's what she'll buddy all right we're about to take off boat that we're about to go jump in a car and see Grandma Terry say goodbye to her back to Manhattan to go back to a time to see Grandma I'm only 15 minutes away and so there were two Crews us to spend some time with Grandma then jump back here got our luggage and at the airport I'm going to pop into the Brooklyn
