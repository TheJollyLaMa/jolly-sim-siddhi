and all those years and in all that we learned was so important to us nowadays people still have their jobs and their homes and their families and their responsibilities but they still need to learn all the things that we learn and so online seems to be the way to do that we want to come to provide everything that the sage groups have been going strong for years now that's a place where you you definitely learn but it's more about like connecting us more about making friends and connecting with people and having a place to discuss and ask questions and share your experiences and so on but the sage Academy is our next big step and that's going to be where you can really study and then we all kind of Interactive Learning going on you watch a video then you breathe on your own then you get together and discuss it in a small group then the teacher and her seeing just like we're going to mix it up and and try to make a powerful learning experience even testing and stuff like that so you can you know nothing too intimidating but so that you can press to make you very uncomfortable like he will school
but but in order to we're just starting to design those courses and we plan on launching Phase 1 in September so it's coming up fast but we really want to hear from all of you we want to design them in a way that really works for you according to how much time you have and coordinate to how you feel you learn best and so on so we just had three simple questions there but it'd be really helpful for us as we go into the design of the courses so those will be launched on the vahni platform which they're great friends of ours and and they do really professional job with them so it's going to be a really great chance please I go there go to our website fill that out and we'd appreciate your help with that
 that's great
 here's our nugget for the day what you got
 Marcus Aurelius you are in mine he has stoic philosopher Roman Emperor
please just say clothes that micro going to come on it there you go
 your little discombobulated I feel it right and I feel it you know I got it I drove in last night trying to find a parking spot and I slept on the couch rolled out of bed but I think any minute now once you start rolling usual you're going to your sleep in a year it's all going to connect disconnect the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts I think I stole this one before you use the slap the happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts there for a guard accordingly
 and take care that you entertain no notion is unsuitable to Virtue and reasonable nature this is such a powerful one you like me to drop I like it because it's all about what we're into it's all about what we're into shows the real University
University Audi of spiritual truths and just even good living
 some of the bigger hurdles in Cal you could culture is you know mediating intoxication Alyssa illicit sex etcetera this is
 big hurdles lot of people struggle to get over then when you get over them you feel like I've done it all those things but it's not just controlling those things those things are just meant to help you go to the next phase which is your thoughts your thought process and you can be in a religion and Ostrom go to cure times are go to spiritual events or Sunday feasts but if you haven't worked on that stuff and we're presenting a spiritual
 sort of like that a little duplicity going on we could present one way but unless we really work
the thoughts on a regular basis and it's hard because the egos such as the ego wants to stand very very firm and very very strong and once I've noticed in my life once I get a hold on it like now I'm doing good with my thoughts then I'll get challenged don't feel like a a hurt a betrayal a broken heart someone's wrong me and then how am I going to react with that whenever something is really going tremendously wrong with me I'd like to program my mind to say oh I get what's going on you know Krishna is yourself picking out it's almost like you step on your just in the Adriatic Sea and there are these
 see and enemies and you can just step on them and you get like not one Splinter but you got a million of these little smokies in your foot and it's super painful and you got to take each one out with a tweezers and so Chris
what is doing this to us when you're a devotee there is nothing bad happening to you any longer now you're just getting refund you're getting your thoughts refund how to react to all those things I mentioned heartbreak betrayal of someone hurt you some cut you off so so we dismissed you as unimportant someone publicly offended you and we're just getting refined now and it's really how am I going to react to how people are treating me and I don't even blame them for what they're doing to me any longer I see them is directly sent by God for my purification that's why I'm taking this one know what you touch down is so important that went when it comes to the the very broad practices of yoga right because there's so many books on on all the time when I say yogurt don't just think Asana you know that the postures and all that but there's this broad tradition of yogurt
Mission you know that's grown out of India that it's all about although it involves study although it involves ritual although it involves etiquette although it involves meditation it involves so many involves culture on so many levels although it's so Broad and vast and is coming from different angles with different strategies but all of it
 everything in it has to do with our thoughts the quality of our thoughts and when we lose touch with that then we get lost in the externals in and forget that's called like niyama graja right it is it's it's an niyama means the rules and niyamas graja means I've lost touch with understanding the purpose of the rules so I'm following them but I'm not getting the goal of where the men to go because I disconnected when and when I say rules and regulations that we have in life I disconnected the regular
with our purpose which has to do with how it affects the quality of my thoughts and so in the west where we didn't grow up with any of this
 generally when we think about improving the quality of our life
 we focus immediately on the externals while I need more money I need a better house any of it or home I need to go to par to okay let's do you know let's write a million books about how to find a better partner let's ride of million books about how to make more money let's write a million book you know in the East are reading a million books about let's see how do I improve my thoughts you know how I remember you know I was talking about how I used to sell books you know publicly you know on the street you know of the other day and I remember one says with his other devotees his name was precocious precocious just like his character was just magnetic you know you sure remember this just like I've just like a glowing
positivity with sharp intelligence in in a in a great sense of humor and handsome guy to write he was just like you know you're like a legend you know he was just amazing person and I remember he was one of those people that could just go out and speak with people really spontaneous and capture their minds and our hearts and in an in and out in a matter of just a few moments he could drive them an interest in reading the bug of agita and they be like yeah I'll take one of those you know and I remember I was just watching him once and he and he would just started speaking to someone and he said you know where electron in a in a busy street thousand people you know the hundreds of people Milling about in busy and he said he began to talk about the quality of our thoughts and he was saying this book is really all about just improving the quality of our thoughts and crew in the problem you know raising it up to it to it to a level of positivity level of spirituality
 he said imagine
I need a stop the person to look around and everybody running around imagine if all of them spend time every day just working on improving the quality of their thoughts what would this world be like at all these you know if it went when we here then we we might feel triggered by for this is rigid regulation in life it's it's actually beautiful I just sometimes the wording and sometimes the weights phrase is it will trigger a sweet we need to work through that together and try to understand what the real messages but when we when we see it it's just like your Sandra. This is all tied to improving the quality of our thoughts and it was really you know there's a lot of brilliant
 ideas that Dom that are shared through these books like that
shirt
 how do you think I forgot I never forgot you I was just thinking when you're saying it's too so yeah we do our physical practice for years
 did your physical practice for years Asana practice but we're not doing I thought practice
 we haven't even entered the doorway at the dorm at maybe get that my clothes to run out to the right out this thing like that would reimburse
 before deciding to shoot mud bog of a time which is every means of Conquest what should offer expect the base and sees to the Supreme Lord and Ryan
Ryan Ritchie the Super Bowl showing being Easter about race Unity
 it's you too much lucky
 irritability nice sticky the horror become eradicated I love you service the Supreme Lord is praise a Transit the songs be established as in a revocable fact home again at the mud on this again on Genesis Chuck Sutton Middletown Nina has my HP going to be in Omaha I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers over the mileage of the torch light of knowledge I have my base and seized at their Lotus feet yeah I think we need to get people to turn off the pictures cuz you were lying and pretty bad. I never been that bad in your mother's house before
 so I don't know if everyone that if Linda knows how to shut those.
 Okay
we have to hear that or no did I hear what did you hear me say that I say did you hear me say it to my face come back and finish cutting in and out
 all right you know where we're at
 refresh my volume 7 chapter 12 text 10:10 to 10 is what we read yesterday but I think I want to read it again so let's see let's see
 as long as a living entity is not completely self realized as long as he's not independent of the misconception of identifying with his body which is nothing but a reflection of the original body and senses he cannot be relieved of the conception of Duality which is a pit of my chest by The Duality between man and woman
 plus there's every chance that he'll fall down
because his intelligence is bewildered
 so a lot a lot here in this verse write a lot of you guys first first there's a statement that dumb
 that that's that's mention that it says the body which is nothing but a reflection of the original body and senses so it's if that's essentially what that's saying is we're in the virtual reality where we have like an avatar that's designed in such a way as reflection in other words it's based on
 a body that that that exists beyond the virtual reality so in other words beyond the world that we live in and that we're moving through we have senses we have eyes we have years we can perceive things you know we had that but we're in kind of like a an avatar body right now moving around and the problem is is that we
I'm fine with that false body right so as long as a living entity is not completely self realize it until we really realize that this isn't me this body send me this Avatar that I'm moving to is not me it's it's just a temporary game I'm playing here
 as long as they haven't achieved that self-realization and as long as they're not independent of misconceptions of identifying with the body then you can't be relieved of the conception of Duality this is good this is bad this is attractive this is repulsive this will make me happy that won't make me happy in the virtual reality and once it's all that's meaningless
 it is it's just this is different types of programming what it will never get as we get it it'll never give us what we want what are heart actually wants in the same way feeding the reflection of the mirror will not feed you if there's you in the mirror and you try to like spoon-feed it a little butter jelly
you're not going to get satisfied it's like I've never done this and I don't know exactly what's all about that they have that game that have been placed on the phone call like candy something or something though, cotton candy know how you know what it is like a candy corn some like that yeah candy cane candy crush candy crush them to get off of it I'm pretty addictive candy right there it looks like from a distance is like you play things and then you win tons of money or something like that right it's like you can real money when that's my point is that is that what it is a real money
 I don't understand that you can win money from it but there are many I thought it was kind of like I thought it was I don't mean in real life like in the game doesn't like it you kind of hit a jackpot or something and everything's been a lot of points and then you can do your Tiara and the
so whether his points or whether it's a game where like you win money like or something like that you really not wanting anything it's just it's just more pixels on a screen it has no value in truth and so it can really although we might feel a sense of satisfaction like oh I just wanted something on Candy Crush I just want a lot of points you really haven't won anything and and similarly if this world is a virtual reality then all of the the things we sent all that will give me happiness that won't actually it's part of the real happiness that you're getting through it it's it's still something artificial yeah it won't give us what grown-ups do I program the say anymore give us a table in the super suit at you that's complete satisfaction to self and then and then it goes on to say that this Duality again when you think of the Wylie really think this will make me happy this external thing will make me happy this external things
no potential to give me happiness that's when we're thinking in a state of Duality it's it's phrases it in very interesting way here it says this conception of Duality which is a pit of my chest
 epitomize means what like you you embody the character of something you represent the character something like to the max right like most essentially so you are pennywise's The Duality it is a bit amazed due out this the Wildey conception do Audi is epitomized by The Duality between man and woman this is where we have our most natural and strong conceptions of Duality right like
 the women can make me happy man can or this woman is very attractive in this one isn't or you know and it really kind of like magnifies this conception to do a Leti and therefore this culture that was so focused on the
I thought they understood it it's not difficult to understand but when you're really examining your mind you're saying when does my mind and most caught up and conceptions of Duality well it's true it is written the connection between men and women in this you know okay then let's see what we need to do let's see how we can regulate our lives so that we can minimize the illusory effect of that and maximized improving the quality of our thoughts it exasperated exasperates the illusion it exasperates the spiderweb of the material world where you go into it you get caught then you go into it a little further to get it out and then something else gets caught the next thing you know you're fully within that spider web
 it end end that this the opposite of dualities Oneness
 and what what
 ARF the philosophy in our lineage in our
Verdi Aria the name of the philosophy
 is a cinta beta beta tuck for that it is understanding that the truth that in truth
 there's a Oneness and there's a difference in both report we need to bounce them out we need to understand them in context and improper writes about that here you don't like in the Western religions that the abrahamic religions
 usually there's a strong emphasis on the distinction of the difference between God and the person right in the soul God is great he's a mission omnipotent all right and Anna and we are insignificant and everything else is Monday and yeah or God is entirely pure and we are born into sin or and and the worst sin
 is I think like an Islam is like the worst said but it's definitely a big sin and Judaism it's a big sin and Christian 12 worship idolatry to worship anyone or anything
that's a separate from God was a nice to say nothing is separate from God this guy Tri-River Yale over the mountain even the stone when you caught in that Western mindset
 you may not be able to understand it at all
 but the Eastern the Eastern philosophers could explain this all very rationally we didn't with great Nuance in it and you know it and dexterity they could really explain how well if God is here why is not got here isn't this the energy of God isn't God's Consciousness infused everywhere so why couldn't I recognize got here and why can I even recognized in one sense the Oneness that I have with God because I am I not made out of God's spiritual energy in so proper addresses in the countryside until one is self-realized
fully independent of the illusory conception of the material body the duality of man and woman must undoubtedly continue
 you know something before I can before I continue sometimes I think both men and women they find a sense of relief when they're in a group of just men or just when it's not even like some animosity towards the other group but it's just like there's a relief in a certain tension or pressure that that's caused by Dua Leti sure if you guys doing what I used to do a bunch of guys doing it then one girl comes in and it would change the whole dynamics of the room not that it's her fault that she's done anything it just happens they become my self-conscious about like what they have there looking Heather presenting yeah right
until want to self realize fully independent of the illusory conception immature body the duality of man and woman must undoubtedly continue but when one is actually self realize this distinction ceases then he quotes very famous verse from the fifth chapter the bhagavad-gita Vidya vinaya sample a permit to Park Asia darshana that the humble Sage
 by virtue of true knowledge they have this Keanu right that I seen the truth they see with equal vision alerted and gentle barometer that means like the most refined member of society right someone lose their thoughts in their habits and in their behavior is all very sensitive and refined they see the gentle Brahma the cow an elephant a dog and then he mentions the dog eater which means like the less refined person write the person whose whose habits aren't so refined who's
he doesn't have that sensitivity
 so he sees them all on the equal platform on the spiritual platform the learning person not only gives up the duality of man and woman
 it also gives of The Duality of Man and animal
 this is the test of self-realization
 one must realize perfectly that the living being is Spirit soul but his tasting interesting way of phrasing what is tasting various types of material bodies right I'm experiencing what it's like to be in the male body I'm experiencing what it's like to be in a female bike I'm experiencing what it's like to be in a dog potty or an elephant one main theoretical you understand this
 but when one has practical realization then they become a pundit the one who knows
 until that time The Duality continues and the conception of man and woman also continues in this stage in this stage one should be extremely careful about mixing with with now
of course proper saying this in the context of the brahmacharya the mail young monkey in a certain stage of training but he saying especially when you're young and the hormones are running wild in your meant to be learning
 let's let's be careful about how how we mix
 it is how we mix the opposite sexes
 very interesting but also another thing that could really use this whole thing apart Whenever there is that mood of trying to say and press the opposite sex and violence really come in as well to need to get in to do my ego vs his ego both trying to impress her and that becomes a whole thing and self it as well so it's like wow again you're getting caught deeper and deeper into the glue trap of Illusion this will make me happy in that won't make me happy and because the Duality between man
epitomizes it it's like it's just the stakes have been risen up like in others I'm convinced that this girl is my ticket to happiness in this other guys competing with me for her so now I got to take him down to show him that I'm better if he stayed in the same thing and then we've got like a whole little mini war on our hands and say yeah it is feeling the tension and scheming and so on so yeah it it's it definitely raises the stakes
 all right
 11 x 11 all the rules and regulations apply equally to the householder and the senior see the one is giving up everything that the member of the renounced order of life
 who got the grihastha the one who has a home and a family however is given permission by the spiritual Master to indulge in sex during the
. favorable for procreation okay so this is a time in life where they say okay if it's not this isn't we're not say men and women should never mix with one another but we're saying is that you should be well-trained going into it you should be have developed good character going into it be virtuous going in to be knowledgeable going into it and then and then there's appeared in your life you know a good long stretch where sexuality is there but hopefully that you're engaging with it from a much better platform
 sure yeah it's not as Whimsical as we've created this I didn't know we just leave the whole thing wide open another day when you just little kids are you know where do you where do you need some of them will you meet them in the bar with my Calibre Caliber men in a bar that's that's the place we go to Ted to meet one another really that's what you came up with that's what your Society Purdue
that's a healthy way to go about this
 okay hey Linda ever meet somebody tomorrow Linda
 oh yeah for love in all the wrong places down in the South right okay good we just check just making sure just checking up on you all right
 the barometer is order has to have taken the vow of celibacy as described above should not indulge in the following applying powder or ointment to the eyes he's in my powder
 massaging head oil massaging the head with oil massaging the body with the hands
seeing a woman or painting a woman's picture what is eating meat
 drinking wine decorating decorating the body with flower Garland so I guess maybe it was more like a flower garlands there was more like your own, Nordeman yeah, smearing sent anointment on the body in a big perfume coming to the yoga class with smelling like a big book at the flowers
 we're decorating the body with ornaments these two that they should give up I'm going to simplify everything right again I live because how it affects our thoughts what am I thinking about when I'm putting on all of these ornaments and decorated with myself where is it taking my thoughts and what is his purpose if it's driving us to see ourselves mirror
as a sexual being
 wrapped in a loop sometimes even the name of working out my working out because the salad I can get it right everything my working out because I want to do I want to eat this body is a gift to want I want to get back with it or do I just want to be attractive to other people I mean I don't think everybody's like that but I think it can you can lean into that too I want primary driving force of material existence sure
 it was Freud afterlife prologue for laid text 13 and 14 according to the rules and regulations mentioned above one who is twice poor named Leah brahmana treachery or baixa should reside in the gurukul under the care of the spiritual Master is the student there they should study and learn already literature's
along with their supplements in the upon a child's
 according to his ability and power to study if possible the student or disciple should reward the spiritual Master with renumeration the spiritual Master requests and then following the Masters order the disciple should leave and accept one of the other ashrams namely the greenhouse. Ostrum the bottom price ashram or the city I saw strong as they desire the way to organize and spiritual Society full of Vedic cultural sure
 so what do we do now we don't do anything it's just like a freak it's a free-for-all yeah everybody goes to school whether you want to go to school or don't go to school everybody doesn't appreciate their teachers in the school. Everybody but it says that
it identified as the three leaders of society the Brahmin is a spiritual leader the Chowchilla is the the the ruler in the political military Justice leader
 the visor is the economic leader the business owners and it says all three of them when they go to school the group cooler which is the the school of the of the guru when they go to school what are they metal study the method of Eric literature's
 along with the supplements and upanishads now the shooter has the employees
 they don't they're not required to study those in order to perform their their role in society that they can they're going to cruise to study them for their spiritual upliftment but it's not that they necessarily need to be instructed that in school that they'll be instructed in the they'll be like in trade schools you know
alert property the way he told it the way that he describes it in the in the commentary was you saying that the spiritual knowledge of The Vedas was meant to be studied by these three groups of leaders and Technology was meant to be studied by the shoe dress right how things work but but the leaders all leaders not only the spiritual leaders but all the leaders political and economic they all had to have a very thorough study of the spiritual teachings so that they could really develop the right spiritual values
 now it also says here that they're meant to study The Vedic literature's along with her supplements and the upon its shots the more that we kind of understand the progression in these literature's the more that we kind of get what we're doing when we're eating human bog time cuz if you go back to like
there's classes of
 Vedic followers that exists to this day
 that they'll say that the
 we were talking about this the other day right that the that the Vedas
 and you punished I didn't even like saying that it's like a little bit redundant because of the pawn shops are part of the four Vedas right but their flavor you know they're their mood they're in the topics that they cover are so they're up a different mood than the other three parts of The Vedas
 and so, noon will sell like The Vedas and the upanishads as if they're different
 but The Vedas and there's supplements Were Meant to study these but this this thing to say those are the original those are the real books those are like that's the breathing of God Louis that's the place
perfect knowledge it's the highest authorities the most important
 we don't we agree with that and particularly the upanishads are the spirit the condensed spiritual teachings and then they condense them more in the bid on to Sutra right onto Sushi which is like the punishers of the spiritual teachings of The Vedas they've been out to Sutra is that those teachings of the upanishads condensed in the in the most typeform 5555
 sutras first little you know a prison now they would look at through the some of these people would look at the at the Mahabharata in the piranhas and in the human body become those are stories they're nice they teach good values they they have some good information in them but that's not where we're going to get the the most authoritative truth
 what they don't understand is that
 these books the Mahabharata which includes the bug of agita and the
honest
 if you accept the authority of the Punisher other than the chain do you Upon a Child calls these books calls Mahabharata cause bug of agita cause a piranhas in the human boxer punching Nevada the fifth Vader right they say that these books are the same quality they're also the breathing of God they're all so perfect there just written in a different way they're their stories that everyone can you know The Vedas were for the priests upanishads refer to these renuncian philosophers
 but when you get mob artists like everybody wants Terry it's like it's with spiritual wisdom Blended in with entertainment in a way that's entirely enthralling changed everything gets became then the spiritual knowledge becomes like wildly popular everybody is tuning into it it's like spiritual truth within a within a magical soap opera yeah totally captivating so, and then particularly the Schumann Bob with time
or the back of a piranha which is a 1 of 18 piranhas
 the Schumann box has written by Beyonce of himself the author of The upanishads in the video to Sutra as a commentary on the video to Sutra write the date on the bane of the sutures lady condensed essence of the spiritual wisdom upon shot but it's soaking that you can't make any sense out of it even though punishes appear contradictory and paradoxical it and you know what is God a person is God not a person is hard for me to figure out there they're also quite cryptic what the speak of the video of the sutures are still more cryptic they need they require explanations they require commentaries to understand and therefore different powerful teachers have written there, tears on the vedanta Sutra and establish their lineages through them but what the srimad bhagwat time is
 is it the author of The vedanta sutras and you punished as writing his own commentary on them because all the other schools are debating the nuances
how do we know what's right amazing what's wrong what's the higher teachings what are the less essential teaching we understand it from the author himself so he writes the shoe involved with time which is 8000 versus full of stories but is his way of giving a commentary on the vedanta suture so that we can understand them in context of we can understand them clearly so these aren't just stories this is the explanation of the condensed spiritual wisdom of the eponymous shots written in story form
 alright just 12
 no texting 13 and 14 x 15 wasn't realize that in the fire in the spiritual master in oneself and in all living entities in all circumstances and conditions the Supreme personality of godhead Vishnu has simultaneously entered
and not entered is situated externally and internally as the full controller of everything okay
 in other words why have I been sharing all of these into this is again the saint Narda Great Sage Naruto
 explain to the king you know about all these different social regulations and rules and codes why we sharing this all what's the purpose of it all where does it all lead to how does it affect the quality of your thoughts that by living life in this way and cultivating knowledge in this way then you begin to realize something that's very subtle but very important in life changing that in and this is exactly what we were talking about a few minutes ago that you begin to understand and not only am I different from God
 but that didn't want another sent I'm one with God and that God is in everything
God is everywhere and if I realize this is see if I think if I'm fully convinced that God is great and we are small that God is pure and we are in pork
 think of how that might and I said that ontologically right like I'm in pure like I was born in pure by Nature I am at was created in pure
 think of how that may affect how I relate with other people
