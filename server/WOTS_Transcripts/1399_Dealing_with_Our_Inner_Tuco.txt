Matt Jaffe brother nature Miguel unbelievable so many people behind the scenes helping this podcast it's very very you know there's something about the community on the podcast it's just we got in there but we're moving to its walk on Wednesday Today everybody so we have a special walk on Wednesday and East resend rain we're going to bring on she is Sage group leader and there's a lot of service for this podcast East welcome to the show and by the way if you're new to walk on Wednesday we bring a guest on about 10 minutes pick the brain a little bit if she could have talked a little bit about this age groups and why it's very critical to into a very very I do a podcast that's not what it is. We just wanted to do a class every morning and that's all we just want to sit we were happy with like 20 people or 30 people and is turned into a
whole International thing
 and I'm the same age groups and then it became a podcast Rob has a podcast this is serious but then it just became more of a community in the community or people have you know I'm very close relationships people date people marry from Louisville to Sage's has it have we had to a marriage if we have no divorces yet I don't think that you are their ages but now she came to Bucky age groups first which one I got a little hint of it so I've known about the Christian Movement since I was a very little girl probably younger than 5 years old my mother worked a minute
I'm down by 1Â° Plaza which was across the street from the Twin Tower so we used to be in her I'm sorry. We are really close to Manhattan place we went to Manhattan quite a bit we had friends there so we would often see the room with your he's doing stuff who knows if I was born in 67 so five years old was still in the early 70s for me I just claim it I saw a problem problem with six most likely he blessed me that is like this incredible
jingles in the car and then some real real real you both so all those kind of like, but then it would be followed by the maha-mantra so like my whole family near the maha-mantra growing up it was something that was just part of our car rides to the beach or Lancaster fast forward to about 2014 I go to manage II who is my my friend spiritual Mentor yoga teacher recommended that I do some saving cuz I wanted something more spiritual than just regular volunteering which is very efficient at times I just thought it was a yoga studio so they kept telling me to go up to the temple and Only God do these dolls Temple what about what class and someone had the courage to go upstairs and as I'm walking up the stairs with Grandma Terri comes down and you know sometimes I blurt out things that don't come out right but I just stopped in and said you guys are still
Browns and I knew right away where he was who he was and everything because like you didn't understand that so I something just happened to me and if those stairs at that moment that I knew I'd found that you know but I need to fill my God she's so that was good then. I made it to the temple and did not have my contacts or glasses on so I thought I'd probably thought it was a real person but I walked up so I didn't want to interrupt this very serious stage looking guy sitting there but I did make it up and then slowly but surely felt more confident than with the guidance of great Association you know just found my past and there's other funny stories doing saver there not knowing who run our Swami was ordered our Swami was and it's all the sorts of funny things that would say and do and
service there where can I find a signal that drive was working out the front desk that's with build-out and a 2015 or 14 to 16 something like that and yeah I remember that enough for me coming down the stairs and I have no idea where her body was on the floor so I'm looking over the desk when he was wrong with the stairs at me and I'm like oh my God this is so weird and then I'm like he's smiling and then the things you and I'm like for what you know he's like no problem literally snap my finger and I never snap fingers but it was just like oh no problem I love doing this teacher trainings errands like that I didn't I did my Advance teacher training there I was there for classes in between as I was doing my apprenticeship and you would come to teach me
classes are well as helping us get all this age groups together yeah we also and she Rupa who was kind enough to inform me while I had spine surgery last September and she's taking up the coordination behind the scenes to you know another level was very organized section and organized you know it is a lot of work so I just want to say I do appreciate her it's not just me behind the scenes anymore and Rodger has always been there as a counselor and guidance and so for those of us who do not know the age groups yet and you know it's a great way to connect weekly online and it's not just with people nearby but his people all over the world I have met friendships everywhere and it's you know I mean I've been to Randolph and I was at Temple and I see Loca there and I just
and she's a leader and I'm like trying you know how to go and she's like for you and I'm like at the time not to initiate Isabella Sagewood she's like she was so shocked but it's just such a wonderful feeling you know and then I was just in Gainesville and I went to the Alachua you know Temple Mungo rtic car to see who's also a group leader and then on my way back I was invited to crash in Hillsborough North Carolina with one of my sage group members and she invited me over to his wanted to crash here to Midway to New Jersey as I was driving back and was able to stay out of devotees house go visit the temple there meet new people I mean the it just you know it's
 saving the
 of my of my life and then I was gone
kid with Prasad and then the next day to go to the temple in the morning I met you know mother, Melanie like and I got to see they're going downhill they have like this little girl would I do you know if I didn't have Association through wisdom of the stages in stage crew so many people over the world and it's a great way to their small group study is there are a couple of groups that are little larger just because of their particular theme but you know it's a great way to learn and choir share about bhakti yoga and I have here the numbers so we register Nation for session Aid open on Saturday this past Saturday and it's been a session
 September 2nd To December 15th so it's going to be a little longer than the summer sessions we figured you know we'll do a couple of sets
smallest sessions just to give the leaders of break but also sometimes it's hard to commit to longer session so this eight-week session I think it went really well with a little sad 22nd yesterday I ended my grade if I did a singles Group by the way I did a single slash single parents and it went really well I'm not going to do it for this longer session but I'll do it again for the shorter session so I know we've been trying to put that out there for a while and it went actually really well and couple of people were sad I'm not doing it this next session but I will bring it back just because of that reason and it didn't I think it went well so I posted on the chat they wasn't of the sages Sage group page so you can go there and register and if you have any questions comments you know anything recommendations we have a new email address so we were using Sage groups 108 @gmail we switching. Seuss age groups and wisdom of the sages.com that's also in the chat and just a couple
the things that I was asked to please remind everybody but before I do that I just want to tell you yesterday starts at about 12 so it's probably even higher now but total slots in 276 for this session builds Lots 222 already and it hasn't even been a week available for spots as of yesterday 12 noon Eastern Standard Time so we filled up about 81% already and then I'm looking here but there's not so many spaces left and it doesn't seem to be one at a time slot that works for me is there any hope depending on if it's one of the larger groups and might not be as easy cuz some people who have like 415 people in them cuz of their specialized theme but for the most part leaders will be okay with letting others than you just have to email us
two people that kind of need something on an evening on a Monday or some like that then we can try to put together a group at that time be kind of adjustment coming in and we think we have like now groups from 6 a.m. in the morning Eastern Standard Time 12 p.m. I'm doing one on Friday see how that goes at 12 p.m. we have 10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time so we were really trying hard to accommodate the times and you know for everybody but yeah right in and let us know and we'll figure it out share with you that you know we we have added additional time zones but keep riding in the more we know the better we can serve you and just a couple of important reminders this came from Jurupa
and Linda time to commit to attending to the regular meetings the attendance is important because it builds the bond within the group and consistency also leaving your cameras on whenever possible we understand sometimes people coming home from work and have to cook or do whatever but if you could leave the cameras on at least when you're speaking of sharing but for the most part I connect to see a face wait we do and if you signed up for a group and then you realize if you you committed and you know and you can't commit to it like sometimes things happened please let your Sage group leader know if you already have their contact information but also let us know by emailing us at Sage groups that wisdom to stages.com just ghost them no please don't go somewhere else to go
sorry we were concerned that you okay did something happen so it's nice to to let us know like it for the most part people have but sometimes people just ghost and that's sofa should be Ghosts, no one shows up butts are there and I'd like to do you delete that group would love that actually thank you also if you have if you have a group member and you would want to share a short story about your experience please also email us at stage groups that was among the pages.com so grateful for all you guys it's really a wonderful thanks and people who sort of like we've known as devotees for a while but they're not
 the Sleep part of wisdom of the ages
they're like wow what you guys are doing it's so exciting I was just I got the thing is taking out a life of its own because it's exciting when it's very very excited when new people get into bhakti because there's that Romancing of Krishna that goes up that comes people who are just sort of like my severing ties with the material world and falling in love with Krishna and it's a very very beautiful thing to witness just like 12 young people are falling in love it sounds great
 the end where are the where are the Eternal when Maris walked away from it you just walked away walk in the west you ghosted your sages I don't walk away man
 the end of the session
you say you step into my Chapel she'll see my special guest and some of the groups are if you guys can come on maybe when we have our meeting our leaders meeting remembers meeting so maybe Mark she doesn't talk what could I do I have to pinch her to make her talk
 you know what is a great way you know obviously it's great cuz there's some spiritual discussion and questions you can put for questions and share what you're going through but also just like you're saying just making friends you know you join you say it in one you how many how many seconds are there in 1 year 3
 there were three of them just coming here before which is for two sessions.
that you mentioned all those make an appointment just asking about the session sir
 connect with 28 people and you do make 28 friends in out of the Stone Age people you're going to have something that you really connect with you share with and you stay in touch with and like you're saying even bump into staying there home different things that that's part of rubber is that one of the rules of Jonas age group you have to let people stay in your home of course he's actually nice because part of culture nowadays is we isolate ourselves from our family very often we don't live near our parents very often we don't live near are our brothers and sisters very often so when we do travel it's very isolated off in time to get a hotel or go somewhere like we were going to Arlington at tonight in personal or tagging cheaper like
 you know it's just like we have this community
and it's almost like how when I was growing up I don't know if you guys did this I had pen pals I had pen pals and I kept in touch with and we need to do a little punk rock mix
 I had pen pal friend that I'm still friends with a collection of stamps and coins yes I did take a pen pal friends to thank you Johnny pretty still have been traveling it's exciting Thank You Sage groups and thank you he's very edgy give a shout out cuz I think he might listen to the Shell book back in the day
hey when you are five years old sing probably walking the streets of Manhattan there was a there was a devotee who used to have a food cart oh yeah by the World Trade Center I used to always go to Jerry Jerry Williams but if you so much food for it up if you were devoted to just cuz you didn't look like anybody who didn't like but he would bet they had books on his food cart and food cart Street on the sidewalks right down by the World Trade Center World Trade Center he was a great and then I think he moved but I think he sent us a message when you was going to say is just started so shout out to you Jerry I think you move to Thailand or something
 chatty Jerry was it 911 that kind of ended that day I think it was 9/11 that that that stirred everything up people moved out of New York
fill you up man Phil me up man anyway it's nice I do think that you shrieked sundry might have been touched by Sheila probably cuz when you said she was how she got into body I was like I was expecting some long drawn-out story but really she just like the family was singing Harry Christian the car on the way to the beach I like wow how is easy
 if you're ready don't I always ready
 there's no nugget tonight we're going right into the stream about the time to write it on the Muskegon of them Cheyenne under load them and even some Little Joe.
 Before resetting the stream of a bug, which is every means a conquest when should I respect the base and cease to the Supreme Lord to Ryan but you know they're trying to reach the Super Bowl
two other sharks walk to the goddess of learning and she'll be off today the author not separate issue about Reese you need somebody to talk to you about Mateen nice to nice to talk to you about the lights tricky the regular tennis in classes the bog of time and my rendering Services a devotees all those Troublesome to the heart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised transcendental songs we establish as in a revocable fact only on this year
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance to my teachers are open my eyes or the torch out of knowledge I have mail Basin Seas at their Lotus feet
 read from the shoe my Bob and Tom Canto 7 chapter 15 x 20 you know Gus back there he looks like a polar bear on a shrinking iceberg
to be finished like global warming is ruining my life
 yeah you know where we're winding up the entire Camp till now
 and which is we've been in for the whole year right since January started yeah and seven Canto and it's ending with these instructions for the householders for the breed hostas sister called in Sanskrit and it's hard as just giving some beautiful advice here that really has to do it yes it was all about can and then write this idea that
 once you do are tendencies that once we get a little Comfort once we get a little pleasure once you know we just want more and more and more and then we drift from our mission you know we don't have a mission in life and that means
is a spiritual Innovation that you want to stay focused we want to receive truth we want to experience the true nature of the self we want to relate to every living being as spirit and we want you know it in this way become released from all these shackles that keep us bound to lower levels of consciousness to anger and greed and depression and all that kind of thing so he's is warning you know he says the Adam from from the not from some kind of judgmental place but from like a you know from his heart he's he's he's sharing that you really need to be careful
 that we don't get too caught up in the material isn't available to us when we're household and we have jobs and money and homes and and sacks and in all that is wide open so he's saying but if you can live with the presence of God in your heart you can feel it then you can feel contentment no it's like you won't feel empty if you feel
God in your heart you always feel full no matter what the how no matter how simple the circumstances are and you won't be driven by the demands of your senses cuz I need to feel that God whole God what a god-shaped hole in the heart. Shape hole putting anything in that hole for God and it's just one of the wandering census is enough for Mission drift you know best I can throw you completely off big-time is a good little squirrel speaking of magnets throwing people off on the top of the
 what's the temple in odisha where they the story of Temple temple was like I think the world's biggest magnet
it's a gigantic Keystone of a magnet and there were temples in India at this time where that the deities were made of things that the deity would float in the sky or some type of magnetic engineering where they made the diesel when you walk in that Temple match and see that Temple a giant TV floating right there
 allowed in that Temple anymore it's just from the outside you look at it I think uh you go in it but it's been you know that the Muslims erected you know they just trashed the whole day let people and it's sort of like in and out you know it's like one of the old school temples it's like a before but I just remembered kind of observing it from the outside outside inside anyway so it's sort of glad you went to the yeah but anyway
 magnet
we talking about and the magnet they I heard the Portuguese were in on the desecration of this Temple because that magnet used to throw their compasses cuz it's right on the C I used to throw their compasses off that screws that powerful
 alright could be an urban legend but that's what I heard or been myth
 maybe not a myth and Legend means it could have some truth so why we ended yesterday here in this really fascinating verse in the end it's a warning as one of your houses I think it's also just a very pertinent warning for people that play a role like a spiritual role in life you know it says because of greed and for the sake of the senses
 this is what will happen is what you'll lose the spiritual strength education the austerity your reputation as a devotee
where is a barometer
 if you're not self-satisfied all that do windows it just seeps out that the gaps you know you got to tighten it up a little slippery slope the slippery slope is where you step one foot out one of those wandering senses here's the warning it's giving it in boggabah Tom terms yesterday we said you're going to lose your good qualities your austerity your character your self-respect right people people are going to lose respect for you you lose it all by just one of those wondrous then it's just like you went a little bit too far and now you're sliding quickly right to the bottom if you drag you right down to this all these warnings in in some out on Dharma Vedic culture at 8 on this regularly right big guardrails you know we hear all the time about quote Uncle Gru's you know these people eat people in the old the world
never in there if people are seeing them is like spiritual leaders or you know I'm kind of gross or something like that and then and then we hear about them just so you know that they're scandalous and it's not and you know it's not necessarily that they were just dumb crooked from the beginning or something like that you know do they live in but but it may have been that they actually had something spiritual going on there and people were connecting with it but they didn't really understand how this works is it is that if you're if you don't as you're getting the the material
 results YouTube the fame maybe money and reputation song if you try to enjoy if you're not content without that sure and you going to start reaching for that and now you're now you become a hypocrite now you're talkin about spiritually but you're trying to enjoy the material realm all of that all that you had your knowledge your
dirty reputation you learn it starts to seep out and you don't then you're kind of like this hollow shell there's nothing really spiritual in there anymore but and as we were saying yesterday then you have two choices right either you turn around in and build it back up and get the you know practice contentment or you fake it you know and that's that's the path that a lot of people will take you know that OK Google now and put on an external shell or being spewed a bunch of followers because I think you made a great point because whenever we hear about a scandal we usually condemned the person so you know this person's always been evil and crooked and manipulative but often times they were in a position where they had Charisma and the material shot that he's going to speak something to share they had good intentions they performed austerity and they develop and they inspired people and that went along pretty good and then what happens when that material Juju on that Good Karma comes
we don't even we should understand this within ourselves that how would we change if all of a sudden Good Karma dumped blessings material blessings on our lap how would we have no deal with lots of Fame how would we deal with lots of money how would we deal with people started bawling all over us it becomes it becomes overwhelming and even if you had it zipped up in a small community in a small village on the big stage you might crumble so sometimes that success can you know a wreck your life and Krishna will give us these tests all we're going to get these tests we want Krishna we're going to get offered all things in the same way the devil brought Jesus right up to the top of the city and maybe was Jerusalem you see all these you see all these cities you can have it all you can have it all Jesus you want it I'm going to give it to you
 Jesus said don't want
content I don't I don't want it and I'm good this is not what I'm here for not today Satan not today for powerful so the opposite of contentment is greed and we're going to hear just two more versus where
 Narda is just really warning about Greek Greek he's kind of categorizing greed is unique because a lot of these other
 what do you want to call them like vices I suppose they can be satisfied in a certain way he's going to talk about that but greed is never satisfied so it will want you to check in on text number or the strong bodily desires and needs of a person disturbed by hunger and thirst or certainly satisfied when he eats similarly if one becomes very angry that anger satisfy by chastisement and its reaction and I feel really angry at someone and you just vent
wake up a little road rage
 you never see me road rage
 but if I keep it private this guy think he is a private road rage even if a greedy person has conquered all the directions of the world or is enjoyed everything in this world still
 they will not be satisfied it's just like anger it's not a good thing to have in you but you can vent and in any kind of feel like okay if it left me left my mind and let my Consciousness and left my body
 hunger yeah you know you just had his 5 but greed is it's of a different nature it'll never be satisfied you got to confront it
 so interesting to steer
verse about that okay need to steer many persons with varied experience many legal advisers many learned Scholars and many persons eligible to become president of learning assemblies all down at the hellish life because of not being satisfied with their positions sure I want to go out and lash out at politicians and of like these you know ultra-wealthy 1% so much that they want to make you know like how much money is enough like what do they want to control it but then I think like who am I to say why don't I just stop blaming them for their you don't they know how to run a business or you know but I know you're right it's another thing to like great people but
 what would I do if I was in that situation
it's really easy to point fingers until you have that incredible Good Fortune we want to really focus on herself and they say like even the proper is proud of the painting right like we met
 degrees is not only something in the hearts of the super-wealthy sure hearts of all of us in different ways sure it's so you know there's this thing called the Peter Principle you know the pewter pewter if I don't know it Peter principle means it I guess it's a thing like you know people that study leadership or bad enough but the idea is that you keep rising up you know like it's a you come into a business or Corporation or something like that and if you're good then you rise to the next level and if you could sell on that level and you write the next level maybe they think it is always you always should be rising like that success but actually you see what happens if you keep Rising until you rise to the level of your income
it's like in till you rise to a level that kind of Beyond you are right happens if you got all the all the people are in levels that are Beyond then it's not good for Corporation you got to know it was like right where your where your level is at this isn't exactly like that but it's kind of like that another was just saying there's a greed even for people that are materially successful and they find high-level positions weather since scholarship for here here was talking about how to say
 presidents are Scholars legal advisors you know you're climbing up in the world and you never satisfied with the position you're seeing someone above you
 and you're feeling empty until you're above them and it's not a formula for success is not a form of her happiness for the formula for constant Disturbed mind a mind they can't become deeply absorbed spiritually and in that mind is distracted from the goal of life
get your mission trips there nothing wrong with excelling in your field but it not for the sake of being higher than someone else you know that's right right right I don't drive or not
 okay so so with that warning now not is going to begin to speak about all of these we call them an arthas right Arthur means like off in the word art has used Sanskrit word art the wells translate as well but it can also do you know what it can be understood as well as like in a sense of like something that's valuable
 and an r that means that which is not valuable that which we don't want and so a lot of these things like lust greed and anger Pride you know the illusion nvd because he's an artist and there's a there's a. In the spiritual path all the North University right we're through your spiritual practice to bring you your mind to spiritual content
through letting go use the ideas that you can overcome these deeply rooted in arthas in the interstate it's like you're actually
 very deeply joyous by Nature by Nature deeply Joyce and ecstatic it on the bag of time after that verse it says and then the Soul becomes a b it's just like we're just contaminated by these different varieties of lust lust for things less where people less for places less for things and then when it leaves you just have this essential being this god-like part of your God lightning Shining Light where you're just like Joe Louis when the mode passion ignorance go away so they Dart tuna vertigo on purple so it's so now for the next
 text 20 through 2:26 or so
speak about all this stuff in an artist and he's just going to give quick analysis of how to overcome how do you overcome less this way how you overcome anger that way how you ever come greet by doing this how do you overcome fear by doing that it's it's a fascinating you know is if it's a disa fastened a little kind of like what do they call that when you getting interviewed at the end and then they start to hit you with the quick questions so yeah rapid fire rapid fire rapid fire answers to lives in arthas to our to our vices in life how to overcome our vices with a rapid-fire answers
 but there is a very deep you know if you could go so deep into these answers
 really beautiful here is a text when he too
 his test 21
 6 * 222 making plans with determination one should give up Lusty desires with desire
not just women or men this stuff like I'm a design with the termination
 desires for sense gratification similarly by giving up Envy one should conquer anger to buy Envy I think of that especially means animosity right if I if I don't feel animosity towards anyone at my anger will just that's why I need to concentrate by discussing the disadvantages of accumulating wealth. Pretty interesting are the disadvantages of accumulating wealth what you give a greed and by discussing the truth when should give up fear
 and like okay let's just think what you're discussing the disadvantages of accumulating wealth what is it that people want to move up at the workplace you who wants to turn down a raise who wants to turn up turn down a position but but but you know
this literature makes you start to analyze what's happening and went where you go from this Consciousness and we have known even as practicing devotees millions of ways to justify it I think the biggest one is a false security a false security we develop we develop a false Security in material
 material Fortune
 white people that was at brahmacharya had no credit cards that means anything could happen at any time
 and you just have to figure it out and you know lean into God now I feel like 12 something to happen I could just you know I got a credit card I got I've got like a good crack could crack it where I could do this or do that our faith is less in God and More in our our credit status you know that's one
on way but there's no he's away that the shastra analyzes could problems the disadvantages another one up just came from out of this as you know I have
 sometimes when people have a lot they give their kids lots and sometimes the kids don't turn out great from getting lots because because sometimes it different powers the child to do anything with their life even as a parent Buffett has something like that we're like he's got the grandkids and stuff and he's not just giving them huge he's kind of trying to help them but it's not just giving them a huge Fortune Cena
 well it's almost like a teenager it's like you want to like support them but you don't want to enable them so when you have so much money and you want to give so much to your kids off and when you hear so many stories like this even the stories of India with the kids become they start to hate the parents and wish their parents death or
in the cases of a whistle shajahan you know the Moguls you know that they imprison the fourteen-year-old son killed the brothers because he realized he wasn't the eldest runs in the wrong ZIP killed his older brothers cuz he was going to inherit anything and imprisoned his father because he wanted to take the throne and it's a problem with accumulating there you could have your son try to kill you or you're ready to give it to you and there's all kind of you know how can affect your relationships how could you know your mind is Concepts or did you know what one of the one of the it's just consider this a classic scene in
 and I in films you know
 if you seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly I haven't never
 purple music and movies at music and movies you got that over me like 70s
elevation shows that's what I got okay. The good the bad the ugly is just like you know it's about it's about two three men out in like the desert you know but some things like taxes like the Civil Wars kind of passing through the area too so it's like and they each get a clue
 of where this treasure is buried like one person knows that it's in a particular graveyard and another person knows that it's in a particular grave
 and so they both late they realize they have to work together if they're going to get this if if they're going to get this treasure but their nature is just just the vicious survival out in the desert there like reptiles and sells you know they're just like it's somehow they have to work together and there's this one character is just like he's just like the worst you know like this guy's name is Tuco
but he's like a you know one minute he's like dragging you through the desert and watching you suffer and didn't you know it like that there's one scene where he's he's he's walking the other characters in cause and Blondie and was like Clint Eastwood and he's he's forcing him to walk through the desert till he dies he's on a horse he's got his umbrella and he's got all his water and he's just like making fun of him and taunting in the whole time and then he's drying out and you know he washes his feet is 2 can wash his feet like in this in the water and like it has a little bucket of water and then he's coming in Clint Eastwood's like to drink the water tell me more and butter and then end the his foot water you know and then write as he's about to drink it kicks it over and I'll just make him suffer
 and then this ghost like it like
Carriage just run with horses without a driver comes rolling in and inside there there's a guy that's giving him the Italian where the treasure is at
 don't you run okay you made your point here right here and so it's in that that like first to go speak into the guy that's dying and he tells him where the details of the name of the graveyard and is like not tell me the name of the Grave he's like you have to get me water first you get me water and I'll tell you the name of the Grave so that took those two runs off to get water he comes back and he's dead but then he sees that Clint Eastwood was almost dead found out the name of the grave and now it's so they go through so much together they they they struggle to survive it and as soon as he does as soon as he finds out that he's got the the secret he's like all will blondie it's good
that you have me here I'm your friend and it hit if I called it a second ago so like this in the final scene
 it shows Tuco he's in the graveyard it's a massive graveyard it's like in the desert you know and this music starts playing the music was so good in that you know like really expertly use in the director so good
 and it's just this music is so powerful and showing to go just running through the graveyard trying to find a grave just like frantic and you just see where greed drives you know it's just like it it will it will it'll drag you down you know it'll drag you down so so I just think it's a beautiful very beautiful but like
 visceral the stroller stration of greed you know in cinemas like that scene or two goes running through the graveyard trying to find it you know and you know that
he's going to he's going to suffer in the end you know but so therefore we need to talk about it you know it's so it's saying you know we need to discuss what are the disadvantages of it it's not don't don't don't approach it like a simpleton but approach it like a sage and try to see what in this realm that were moving through in this world ever moving through what is wealth and how does a wise person engage with it he may be wealthy he may be dirt poor but a wise person the unit will have a healthy insightful way of dealing with it rather than let them letting themselves be controlled by it and in order to have that you need to discuss it you know what you need right now Shelter lyrics by one concern
 this was what I was born with your eye I don't want wealth what kind of by
can I purchase that will satisfy you want successful you better invest but they're still distress don't buy their lie
