cheese expert at that and both of them are coming up this week for chant camp and we wanted to just make your brain a little hear you hear what you want what you want to offer this weekend
 all of this is our second you're coming we were there last year last year at kind of coincided with the gym estimated which is really sweet you know we get to do kirtan and with a little bit of a kind of educational bent on sometimes we talked a little philosophy sometimes there's some little rudimentary discussions on fundamentals instrument workshops act a little bit of our Raga and tell them little card that was a little younger and it's because it's a small little clothes group were able to have and a one-on-ones and different people come with different levels of experience are and they come with different questions some of them are
can some of them are just simple how do I hold the cartels and so we just hold that space we grew up doing kids on all our lives and it's it's our main service or main contribution and so it's kind of what kind of blow with with everybody and just do lots of here then every day we're doing it you know first thing in the morning and then I'll see you in the middle of the day and then in the evening that sits as much good thing is you can fit into a day and Donnie and myself are the teachers but you got to understand I'm like a ten-year-old with a guitar and these guys are like Led Zeppelin showing up here. I mean so I'm one of the teachers but I always defer to these guys as my teachers and to have them up and I'm not a black belt in kirtan for sure but I can teach some people some things but these guys are really like having them in this in a super soul is a small thing it's not like this massive training where to get one-on-one Conte
what is great here tan Masters I will say and if you watch them in action they're just real Masters going to get that one-on-one contribution I mean just down the road an hour south that Omega ecstatic chant is going on and it's just like everybody is there you just can't you just can't even touch those musicians because they're they're they're so distant so but I feel like we've got these guys who could weave their own huge kirtan Festival here in an intimate setting there's two spaces left if you're interested go to yoga under slash events and you can sign up for that but I'm excited and Ross going to have these guys chant classical bhajans just classical Bhajan is that everyone should know and then in the evening time we'll make that our local Communities going to come by to pedicure times Saturday and Sunday and we've got a special guest on Sunday as well we can't tell you who it is but it's
we're trying to like get a couple more special guests because they might be nearby so super happy to have your back and your whole family is really nice to have you we heard it's your birthday on Friday that's the rumor some gas I'm turning 39 on Friday 39 yeah
 there's a whole new generation of kirtan going on and you know my Dory cut down in Alachua sent me I said how are the my son is living in Alachua so I said how's the Cure time going down there he's sent me videos of Vishal bar leading the Cureton and the whole team they're chanting and you guys had a ton Maha Marathon I just see my 17 year old with like 15 to 20 other 10 year old boys jumping up and down it was so beautiful to watch and then you the camera pans for the right there's like 70
teenage girls dancing up and down I was like this is good clean fun for teenagers this is what I was supposed to be in custody but we're not doing when we were 17 years old you know and so it was beautiful to see what was that kirtan Festival like
 so for us sound Alachua is it's really a family Temple you know it's we grew up there I was there in 89 hours for years old and in many ways it's evolved button so many like in the big ways it really hasn't changed like if you took that same footage any decade of janmashtami Festival it would have looked like that is kind of us doing kirtan now it's like now we have kids that are jumping in the kid time but the we were that and what do you know about when I was 17 18 we were doing we were jumping around dancing so it's like you know maybe the tunes or
more complicated and in a family's evolve in like the face of the community has kind of like expanded but really
 just like ecstatically getting together and kind of there's a little bit of like it's almost I got temporary Madness that comes over you on these big festivals you're so invigorated with with everybody's enthusiasm that you just kind of let loose and and a lot of people feel like spiritual breakthroughs there's a few people that we were talking to that felt like wow I really would kind of want to renew renew my side or not it's like a it's like a fresh start and then of course we're just sitting down and doing what comes natural which is just singing all day you know what you would do if I was shaking the morning and then there's kids on happening all throughout the day then in the evening there's Community Abhishek where everybody can convey the DVDs and all their little pockets of kids on happening all over the
the temple property and it's it's beautiful and it's unchanging and and constantly evolving at the same time
 the stupid his generation cuz you're a little older than you and you grew up Channing the holy name and your from a hold dynasty of devotee like all your your fathers and your brother said they were all initiated but you know it's just like if you go to watch with your Rico
 Dynasty brothers and uncles and cousins are all devotees but who's to listen to any of these next-generation kirtan it they taking care of time to such new levels It's So Sophisticated now we just were youtubing some kirtan so yesterday and I was just like oh wow I can't even I can't even come close to the stuff I can't it's just not it's not within my capability

the cure for you you go to YouTube and put remembering sure the problem pod and a bunch of idiots come up its these these people probably in their 50s you know cuz I think this was done 20 years ago perhaps and they're just talking about Power Pod and it's it's so wonderful cuz you who it was who is this I'm forgetting his dinner we had them on the show one time he is out in Los Angeles Romero those videos in the LA

 but any case you those are very nice videos I had you know yesterday a friend sent me
 a recording of my Guru
 reading
Sid hunter that same sounds approval goes to down to the ass but someone send me a recording of my group reading about Sheila prophet in his life and then commenting on it it was like an old recording you know I tell you brought me back it was it was actually one of the most Sublime things I ever heard it was just I had this experience I just it's hard to describe
 just feelings in my mind feelings in my heart it was an experience I listen to yamuna Debbie yesterday Gary Raj swamy it's just like first of all high-caliber people High Caliber people who just said you know what I'm going to give my entire life to God and to Guru and there's something about associating through with those people that will change your day and start to like yeah what the hell am I doing with my life it just makes you a recap
write your desires recalibrate your direction your focus your your your ideas of what fun is and you see as they're getting older like what a noble life they've done everything and you see how blessed they are and in and you feel like wow I had em connected with this lineage it's very very powerful so if you feel like what am I going to do today especially if you have a drive to go on today or you got to do some busy work you know what I do I'm a Lawns I mow Lawns for a living I mow my own lawn and it takes me my life and I just put on headphones and I listen to things like this and it's so damn rewarding
 Jimmy James says I fall asleep listen to prop hunt memories memories
 he does you know anybody with me today and I'm not sure
if you put in problem on memory so I think that's what I was listening to it it's got all these different series of DVDs with different emojis thank you YouTube right the Perfection of YouTube you know
 all right yeah I mean there you go again the devotees have to be these archaeologists digging into pop culture and extracting what is digging into the information age and extracting what is actually valuable you know hearing from Saints here hearing from dedicated devotees watching animal attack videos just to protect yourself and then you don't leave the rest behind Okay let's dive into this Mister go still but we got the srimad bhagavatam to read Ryan on the bus get down there some that I told you I almost died yet before we sign the sheet my pocket on witches are very music
what should I prepare for the base is used to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach to the Super Bowl Steven being at your mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and just really awesome Dave the author praise about race Unity among God's a bag of it to you tomorrow but regular tennis in class in the Bog of time and the rendering Services if your devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord we praise with transcendental songs will be established as a revocable fact Beyond on Genesee. I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes or the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet
 we all need a heart to be touched and turned and poked I was I have I got choked
I cried a little yesterday it was something your mother give Luna said and Jiu-Jitsu nuff a big Burly Zoomer black belt in Jiu-Jitsu he said I was listening also and I was like I broke into tears when I started crying something I can't remember what do something
 it's somewhat one of her personal struggles and she's just so humble to so humble and she just said something and feeling so blessed and feel fortunate and she said you know I'm struggling I was traveling and probably just remember what it was
 I'll go back and listen to it again and I read it from the Shema by the time she can do 7 chapter 15 text 45 cuz it's been awhile when I give us a little catch-up
 overcoming
and now there's about 35 vs left in the seventh canto
 and it's that pretty much the entire Kanto is been Naruto speaking to you this year
 another Great Sage speaking to the great king and he's kind of going to be wrapping up everything he just we just heard kind of is nard was kind of going back to the Punisher to taking some of the metaphors when you punish as like the body is a chariot in the senses of the horses that are pulling the Chariot you know the soul is the passenger in The Chariot the intelligence is the driver it's meant to control the mind in a sense is going to get the horses under control and direct them and it got even more elaborate than that then you also a kind of he kind of merge two metaphors because then it it went to that one where what is it that the ohm is the bow
 right and
the Montreal men's the self is the the arrow and Target is this you know the Supreme you know the Supreme Lord and so it kind of had not only the Cherry but like the bow and arrow and everything you know on the chair being fired in that direction and so he's kind of wrapping up that analogy now and he's going to go into today what we start as a section where he's just kind of said you know a sent you there two ways you can go in life there's kind of the pro material engagement path
 and the anti material material engagement but in other words material engagement as a source of my happiness that there's a pro pad that's in an anti pass and it is going to show where they each lead and then he's going to wrap up the chapter
 alright let's dive into this text 45
who is one has to accept a material body isn't a great way to put it we have to include that this material body were being forced to do it with its different parts and paraphernalia which are not fully under one's control right you can't choose no that's that's what we're just here in like another is the census those are the what what are the parts in the paraphernalia it will have senses I have this cognitive faculty which is multifaceted there's a the accepting or rejecting part of the mind is the reasoning part of the mind is a self-identity part of the month so this is like all that equipment that is how God is not necessarily under our control our senses may be dragging us places rather than us having them under control
 as long as one has to accept a material body with its different parts and paraphernalia that's also gross things too like I wanted bigger hands I want to be taller I want to be smarter
 you just got
got you can work on it but you know he basically got this, so you're getting a body it's out of your control you get some parts you get a subtle body
 one must have the Lotus feet of his superiors name of the spiritual master and the spiritual Masters predecessors
 why not just The Birches hurts Master what I was feeling when I heard that recording it I'll talk at you continue okay I'll get back to you okay just great their Mercy at the gurus and the girls go to listen to go to school to Career was right the whole except like succession by their Mercy one can sharpen the sort of knowledge and with the power of the Supreme personality of God had mercy 1 Mustang conquer the enemy has mentioned above in this way the devotee should be able to merge into his own transcendental Bliss and then he may give up his body and resume a spiritual identity
Zoom is spiritual identity like we've had a spiritual identity we've lost it and nine dormant yeah that's kind of like the Matrix thing to or like all the bodies to lying in these test tubes smoke it's kind of like and it just you know waiting for you do you can wake up and going to bust out of the tube and just kind of resume your your real identity but you don't want that that term spiritual master and I think we're conditioned we hear that word Master we think like slavery Master kind of like we remember like Roots When we are growing up that television series Roots so I can do some aspirin Years a Slave and Kunta Kinte Yes master some I I want I want to be a master who I looked up the word master and
 it had to be you know quite a few definitions is it come from maistro I didn't I didn't go
but but you know it.
 One of them was a person who has dominance or control of something
 and another one was a skilled practitioner
 of a particular order activity
 so you don't so I think both of those are important you know like everything you do one thing is when we think Master don't think so much like slave master think more like Kung Fu Master and I like someone who is Right skilled at a particular art or you know right and we are the problem is once we think a master we think of ourselves as another word which is a pejorative practically in our culture is a disciple that sounds really lowly doesn't it doesn't sound lonely but it sounds more like our Antiquated or something like that like like you're just something that happened in the Bible or something by the typos, disciple of his Holiness whatever but yeah so so going
so there is that that idea of life here is saying that you have to find someone who's a skilled practitioner in a particular order activity right someone who knows the spiritual path in who's mastered it who who who is expert at spiritual practice she had to find that kind of person but I also think maybe even more directly here when we when we say a person who is dominant or control of something and here we say that the that they was the spiritual Master is the person who is dominated or controlled his own senses his own lower nature he's not his Chariot of his body isn't running wild because the horses are just pulling in any way he got the whole thing under control he dominated his senses and he dominated his mind so that he could be free
 and unless work unless we come under the tutelage right of such a person you never learn how to do it
and you remain a slave that it is kind of flips it. Now I actually now you do have that Massa you know what that is like your own senses in your own you know the Mastermind my body and my senses right bachal Vega Menasha coronavirus last of a gum 800 on your vision hit the dealer her when we hear this is really practical stuff if if you really want to practice yoga if you really want him practice spirituality if you really want to if you have some
 faith in these ancient texts they're all telling us that we do need to find that spiritual master and look for someone that has their senses under control look for you don't look for the person that's telling you all
 it's a
to let your senses do what you want to do and do what they want to do cuz you get these imposters that will pose that if they'll take so much of the teachings that makes so much sense that is their Cloud the mind is accepting or rejecting it is right now he's really on to something you know he'll he'll take all these truths from from these ancient text and then kind of misappropriate them at the end and use them to teach something else that that's easier for you to swallow what you do with your senses want to do it and then kind of get your reverence for your money or whatever it is that they're taken from you so look for the person that said that is a master of their own senses you know that this got it all under control that's their their Chariot is is being well directed
 okay I was good I finish that movie that hoversten otherwise
picture of a cheetah and Bala Dave and it shoots it means the infallible then the senses acting as the horses right and the intelligence acting as the driver both being prone to bacterial contamination
 inattentively bring the body which acts as The Chariot to the path of Sims gratification and which one is a good example of this when one is subtracted by those again by the the Rogues of viscaya eating sleeping mating the horses in The Chariot driver are thrown into the blinding dark well of material existence and one is again put into the dangerous and extremely fearful situation of repeated birth and death okay here's the example can I give him can I can I come clean here Mara let's go
what you're going to say to clean a fasted all day I'm water at it I was like even in the evening time that was serving out everybody me and Jamie step Jojo and Mara and Catherine a serving out I felt very detached and my son was like are you you want to eat some food doesn't bother you and you survive out food I feel good I feel good and I felt a little proud as well the next day I was like you know what is proposed appearance day I'm going to do a dry fast till noon
 so I just did no water and I went for a bike ride with no water and I just like I'm just going to drive fast till noon and it was 92° all good felt good all day then marry me this great little meals for me yesterday I was so nice
she made the first real proud pie she made a proud pot in me yeah
 and then under my head you could feel horns growing
 Marisa sleep
 Terrence is asleep and devil horns are growing on my head and I just almost as if a goat got into the garden I went into that pantry and go to it out like and like just went through that there was no Rhyme or Reason it was just like an extreme backlash a late-night backlash binge Mara and and you know I went to bed thinking about Krishna whether I'm sense controlled or whether I'm completely indulgent
 I'm yours and I'm helpless in in your hands I have no control I think sometimes I get proud
that control over my senses but I'm no better than just to go it will just like walk into your house and start eating everything start eating ever hang out with goats goats we'll just so you could be some goat from goat food he'll take it out of your hand then they'll climb in your car and start eating like that an envelope or your mail and goats are insane Valley saying about goats yeah there's nothing there's nothing a goat won't eat and there's nothing a something real nice to say so I'm very good go to a sort of my probably my spirit animal perhaps you know if you know
 perhaps I'll get a goat head in my next birth but I'm just putting that out there according to this last text
 when it when one is less attracted Again by the Rogues of the Shia
 is eating like he did something wrong
write the horses in The Chariot are thrown into the blinding dark well I felt like was The Wealth of material existence and one is again put into a dangerous and extremely fearful situation repeat birth and death
 o Krishna
 yeah it's it's saying that unless we were making a very conscious effort to connect to the origin of everything is natural that are the body and the mind that we have will not actually pull it towards the path of sense gratification this is where you going to find happiness and satisfaction this is this is what you need and the result of that and this is where it gets a little scary ride with this was a bug bomb with X telling us something it's saying the result of that is you you will find yourself not all the time
 you'll have your moments of gratifying your senses and feeling some sense of satisfaction that is ultimately paltry compared to deep spiritual satisfaction but you'll have you'll have those times but you also have time
in this world that are extremely fearful you know it and when those times hit we get bewildered and we get confused and we get desperate and but those times come in unless you've mastered this you will really suffering those times so it's a compassionate message now one might ask the question well you're saying here the taking this path of of material enjoyment
 isn't that all but it isn't material enjoyment also prescribed in The Vedas like if we go back to these ancient texts The Vedas they're talkin about how to live a life where your dutiful will you perform the Rite ritual and you do some sacrifice expressing gratitude to your to your rituals and then you could enjoy the things of this world you get you know why else in Beauty and the birth of healthy children and your crops will grow and the next world there's all these
I've been lead the lights in see a thing is a lot of the especially our community they don't get into bhakti from that they don't get in the back you like how can I enjoy more let's get into some religious path in India there's a there's so many Swami's were teaching Bonafide traditions of how to beat and enjoy your in this world and how to enjoy in the heavens in the higher planet planets and there's so much faith in the culture and in the afterlife and reincarnation that people are like okay this is a religious system this is beautiful this is Dharma I want to enjoy everybody wants a healthy family a good spouse let's do it but we don't read those books from the get-go we hear from bhakti vedanta's who say it with your world is a miserable place this year only will go if you're going to any Hindu temple you'll need a lie if you if you have the ice is Seadrill Seadrill okay here will worshipping you know this Davy and we worship her for you no good health and this one over here we worship this one for you know prosperity
you know this is why we worship get a show and Lakshmi Devi we worship her you know for this blessing and headed in the Indus Express in a way that it's actually nice you know it's okay oh I see it they're connected with the personified aspects of nature you know that behind nature there's always a person and we connect with them and and through that we prosper and we're healthy and it it's a nice thing but it's so here's the question is it will if that's so if it is he's ancient extra saying that are prescribing this
 well then why are you saying such a dark fearful thing it in the idea is that there's different prescriptions given to people according to the different levels of their understanding and so for some people it's a step up to to connect in that way rather than just be completely rudderless
 you're not now I'm following you say to text in through that not only in my purse prosper
I truly but I'm also kind of learning something about life as we go along you know some of the messages about life or coming through now is going to be going to speak about you know there's two ways a person Google in this world right there's a pro material enjoyment
 and there's the anti-material eat with the terms of property and they were too pretty in this case kind means like and get engagement so and you can see the the Sanskrit
 prefixes right property like Pro Realty
 and never ET like that never see another negation already and every chain on non-engagement tip Rowan on property and never T so now. Is going to speak about those two as in you know, just give a comparative study of them
 video interesting according to The Vedas there two kinds of activities or property a customer says it or a good way to remember
nivruti activities involved raising oneself from a lower to a higher condition a materialistic life right where is New pretty means the cessation of material desire through property activities one suffers from Material entanglement but by never to activities what is purified and becomes fit to enjoy the Eternal Blissful life through property activities one suffers from material on you could say through property activities one enjoys and then suffers her head that's kind of how it works and Liberty says you know what I don't need the material and join me and the and the material suffering that is always interwoven with it I'm I'm I want to move past that
 sure this is only coming from the Western culture
a lot of us have had we grouped maybe we maybe our parents didn't have like my parents never had anything but I always grew up with always feeling a little secure I could let you know I just want to be able to buy Matt want I never liked had a regular job I've always hoped musician a yoga teacher did lots of travel been all over the world a lot of us come from a culture of having and getting what we want and getting our desires fulfilled as if we were doing ritualistic Vedic work 2% gratification Ohio planets
 a lot of us have been to the best beaches in the world or we've been to traveling all over the world have had Adventure vacations we've been to the Caribbean we know we traveled America we've done a lot of stuff like that and we still get to this now we get to this point okay I've have and I'm like implicated I'm more entangled sometimes on our path to material happiness but your happiness becomes like a network of Mo
desires one desire you open the door in thousand more desires there and I met this cool guy and this cool guy introduced me to hundreds of new desires then I got into this whole new hobby which cost them more and this thing called a new Hobby Lobby give me what I want and we go down all these past we collect storage containers a junk basements of junk stuff that becomes useless stuff we have to fire sale and not worth anything to us anymore and we never actually fulfilled our hearts go it all became a big well that was exciting but now what and we start to realize it's not like the stuff in our life that is going to make us happy it's a community of spiritual people that give us groundedness enjoy and that's like a big realization a lot of us that
here are getting right now like yeah I've got a lot I've got stuff I can do what I want but this is actually what I really want and we've traded in re2 some Crews to go on a pilgrimage or come up to come up to the farm for a save a weekend or when we were like I want something a little different and we've realized that the the path of sense gratification doesn't really deliver what I thought it would promise and that's because I'm not a material being try to enjoy the material world I'm a spiritual being trying to enjoy the material world and there's a dilemma there even help
 the way that the depravity Marg works
 write the way that the path of material enjoyment works is that it's always promising us that we're going to achieve something that others have achieved before us
that's really satisfying is who is pythia but the fact is you know what happens if someone like I have to have this unusual life or never, I don't really have a regular job but my service kind of has taken me to certain places in the world where other people want to go right live like I never really been on a vacation are Kelly but I've been to places where people go on vacations you know like where
 well like I've been to Italy or you know that's funny yeah I've been to London and I've been to you know Germany I've been to India obviously many times I've been to South America and yeah and like I said you you mention the beach which I do think a lot of it's just kind of there's something so beautiful about the beach so suck dick like that is fine about it and yeah and then of course the way that the property Mart works is it becomes associated with bikinis
there's also tragedy what but it but even setting aside the tragedy like a rogue waves rogue waves wave comes in for swimming for their wives
 what happened to the fact is that when you get to that Beach
 that everybody wants to go to you you realize that actually a lot of people want to come to this beach they've all seen the poster and they've all seen the advertisement and they're all spending a lot of money to come here
 and they're all here at the same time of the year and so although it was kind of nice it's never as satisfying as you would hoped it would be
the end of the trip
 the majority of the people are like I went I spent a lot of money I promoted myself as enjoying on Instagram I let everybody know
 that I'm really enjoying life yeah right checking me out here and the ocean that's a big one here's my cross and calls and the ocean but but but does it sell the house satisfied are we really were the fantasy you do then you then you begin to realize you really only enjoy life when you can have like some private beach somewhere and for that you need like tons of money and if we get there even if you finally get tons of money what it took you to get that tons of money generally menu had to compromise something on the way for that that also kind of deals your satisfaction life you know and end in in this way
 this entire world and its promise of satisfaction actually never really deliver
and at some point that's got a sink in and it's got a Sinking Deep at some point we got to realize that path of material enjoyment is never ever going to feel me it's a bunch of false promises and it's giving you just enough to keep your going it's give me that you're only going to make you think there's more to this I just got a perfect it more yep and then the other than the fact that you brought up the beach so I guess there's something about the beach yet cuz it's in the mode of goodness like people who like to have a backpack or hike or go to the Grand Canyon or go to a pristine Beach that will get you to this level of Happiness most of us don't usually get why because we're the most passionate ignorance so when you get around the sea or the ocean or the mountains we feel like this is the real me this is the authentic me I just need to reground that's all
 now that's not all you need something higher than that that's good and we need to get to this sattva Guna to have some real
lasting something better quality of happiness in the same way a drug addict is all so happy you're happy in their stupor they're happy sleeping on the streets intoxicated we don't want that happiness then we advance a little bit more we want happiness in the mode of passion you know I take my kids to the stock car races were like stock car races were screaming yeah that's the type of happiness but happiness going for a hike or going that is like a different type of happiness and we realize this is the real happiness and the Box TV dog does the Yogi Bear say actually there's something even higher than Mets Transit Dental happiness
 it's so true and you know the world is if we return to it if we're looking for it it will give us these messages like say even do go and say they do have a relatively good time right leg say all that was a really nice vacation what's happening
is as a vacation is going on in the time is ticking away you realizing I need I'm going to have to go back I'm going to have to go back I don't have to go back and then you go back and you realize I went up and I came back down and now I'm back on the subway I'm back in the car will be in traffic go driving to work doing a job that maybe I don't know and it's it's the it's the material energy giving you a message
 Marcus behind this suffering the material energy is Durga who's actually compassionate being even though she's sticking those spikes of material life into us but she's she said just look
 are you reading these texts about how you help people may Ascend through piety they may Ascend to the higher planets and enjoy tremendously but they always have to come back down and would you just did was you did that in the middle of micro version of it you know there's the macro version and you just lived out over the course of a week and a half a micro version of going to hemly plants
return and there's a message there then that is the nature of the material energy it brings you up and then it brings you down and and the sooner one just really understands there's a I need to know if I'm ever going to get my wheels out of spinning in the mud
 just going to have to be some kind of leap of faith or at least some serious investigation into another path right there is another approach to life beyond I will find happiness through material enjoyment and so that's what it say hey there is another Mark it's called the number to Mark then where you say I'm not looking for my my foot filament through external things there's another path so good and happy and
hatched and empowered and strong and then the contamination of the senses and then there's indulgences and there's regret is that like every Chomp every goat Chomp I was chomping I was like that's it in the beginning when we try to walk that path it is Manifest in the stage Bogota go right it's like okay I'll just then let it go then bring it back then rejected to get that and then you said you called that dead regret you know that feeling of regret whether it's because we just indulged you know and eating some junk or whether it's were coming back from the vacation is said
 that a nut I just did the best thing and I'm still not satisfied and now I'm going back you know that that feeling of regret
that's very meaningful that that's that's a blessing sure you know cuz it's meant to help us understand the material the material path doesn't work you know what we could just tease this out with my whole life tomorrow by owner examples but it's time for the show to wrap up maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow could be looking for a medley of my blunders all files in how to put a rougher unmute some people tell all their Miss apps
