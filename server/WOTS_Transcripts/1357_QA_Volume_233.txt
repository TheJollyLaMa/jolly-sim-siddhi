How are you how are you it's it's well you don't have to ask if I have a world where everybody is muted except me not asking for conversation I'm just asking to talk but you don't have to ask if you want to just do it while they're in a week all those questions that don't need an answer
 what you see people positive they didn't they accept even a superficial report when I said how are you you're not supposed to answer that that we're here questions
an answer
 no they don't even some on some level once you know they receive an answer to all questions is that by definition they don't have an answer Linda come on you want to you're educated your corporate tell us retarded questions is a rhetorical question is what are you what is your head full of cheese
 anyone whatever this is such a snot smooth man come on you know how you doing today are you slow jam
 I see a rhetorical question is a question asked in order to create a
Matic affect what you make a point or to make a point but you weren't doing that when you say how you doing in effect or or point
 alright you see that's where you just you going to your four-year-old kind of thing or not you just say that was dramatic know it wasn't traumatic for the four year olds all right let's get this thing going right now just to answer them I'm rocking up I'm four years old today and I'm going to try my best to give a four-year-old answer your questions any announcements Miss Linda Linda Linda who's filling in for Miss Mara who's in

nobody does India in January like wisdom of the sages so there's a lot of options out there but wisdom of the sages does it the best so go to listen to stages.com and register you know it's like it's like you want to learn French while you can take an online course and you get a couple do about an hour and a half a day for about 6 years you get pretty good French or you could just go to Paris and learn it pretty quickly when I get thrown right into it it's like a teacher training where you're like so immersed in it the whole thing because because part of our basic education and the wisdom training as well it's not just like we're studying books you actually have to live the culture and
 exponentially more than sitting down and even reading a chapter the buggy there everyday you're like immersed in the culture of bhakti the culture of yoga the culture of kirtan and that's why people find it so transformational
Franny's Harris go to Paris learn it immersion is what you talkin about you immerse yourself going to version blender alright we ready to get into the question should I bring me some good questions I'm going to read you the first question that you specifically aimed at me is asked of you and that means what means I could come in after me well it's being coming in your direction
 already this is a heavy question.
 Anonymous writer writes I know you went to speaking to you wrong I know you went through a hard time with divorce while ago
 and I recently found out two weeks before my wedding
 that my partner you don't even have to go further wow this is going to be heavy
go ahead I recently found a two weeks before my wedding my partner was cheating on me it led to a very traumatic breakup and I just want to ask you how you got through it how did you come out the other side because this is the hardest thing I've had to deal with and I've never experienced heartbreak like this before any advice would be so welcome then the writer continues this is also part of the backup story there's a backup story as little backstory I was with him for 12 years
 he suffered with drug addiction once and I found out and I left then he got into recovery and got clean and we got back together even started chanting as part of his meditation and we were great as far as I knew and then he cheated I found out and he denied it at first it made me feel like I was crazy.
finally admitted so basically I'm gone away from the relationship with nothing I've had to move back in with my parents and sister and I have no savings I lived in his house so I had no ownership soon away Christmas taking a lot away from me but it's not even just the person in the marriage the home and everything I'm struggling to let go he said to me I would find it hard to find someone who did all that he did for me and that stuck in my mind all of that might not be relevant but I just want to know how I get through this thank you so much
 help Rogan.
 Well thank you for sharing that very very painful to hear how many people when they first heard that first sentence was like I hate this guy
 and if I was your older brother
kick this guy's ass
 that's the first thing that comes to mind and
 this is
 it directs us that that directs me to my sort of carnal nature I want Wornall Cardinal do with might like my my bodily like my bodily Instinct wants what a fight this guy when I crush this guy when I get revenge on this guy and so the best advice I got from running us while I was
 during a split up even if it's amicable
 this is the complete opposite of a miracle is betrayal it's like the heart is betrayed it's devastating I think a lot of people can relate with this question
 as we've all been hurt
 Mariah said to me go through this as quickly as you can without resentment without
spite without Revenge without resentment Spite and revenge have to spite and without Revenge okay and
 I naturally
 go right to the resentments so it's like really I can't do those things if any time there is a time to do that I was about to get married I hired the photographer I got the I've arranged for the chairs in the table settings and the napkins and I find out two weeks before that like I don't even know who this person is it seems like you get a pass on can't resent can't have a secret Revenge it seems like you should get a pass on that
 unfortunately this is a spiritual podcast
and part of our spiritual life means we have to take care of her Mental Health
 and there is nothing
 I'm not even speaking for you I'm just speaking for me there's nothing that I can do in my life
 to get back what was taken we can't get back what was taken and what was taken from you was this idea of a nice romantic healthy strong a seed of a relationship that could fruit onto family and children excetera and that was just destroyed there's nothing he can do to take that back that happened
 and as devotees
 when we want to move towards revenge or spite or calling them out or getting on the and if you've ever seen that show Cheaters or like there's Instagram account or like he is going to come from
the cheater right now
 and it seems like I'm going to get you I'm going to put you on Instagram cheating
 it's not going to help that is not going to help the person who's been hurt or betrayed
 we have to immediately let go of that resentment like weather badge let go of the spite because living in that mine will torturous forever
 let me ask you a question really is really just repeating her question
 she sang I want to ask how you got through it so I think what you're giving out his credibly valuable advice but it made kind of like the Mind goes through Loops it's not just easier to let that go but are their practical things that you did to get through it you know just how you feel your time and you are home
 well I noticed that the body did keep score and even during when I thought was like well I'm going to go out and just spread the holy name and I spent a year
after a split up
 we sort of had an amicable amicable split up with that doesn't mean we're not affected even if it's amicable because you know you have the destruction of the family unit and that's devastating for human being
 and so I thought the best way to deal with it was you know what you go out and you do what I do I speak I read in the Bible Tom but I do the Wiz massages every day I started about the time but I found that even after a year although I presented very well
 I was suffering from extreme anxiety
 and the things I was based on what's going to happen to my kids was going to have my business what's going to happen my family what's going to what is it going to happen to me what's going to happen to my home and these are just like very real things that people going through a split up face
so I had to just do a little bit of
 you know
 a little bit of self self care which included in m
 just not just being so public but actually privately reading privately journaling pranayama yoga walking in the forest contemplating what's going on but the whole time using the directions of those no resentment no Spite and no Revenge the big thing of going forward was
 telling my story of Woe that this is a big thing because I can't move forward if I keep reinforcing
 my truth of this is how I was hurt this is what he did to me this is and by not seeing either my part or God's part in it
 I have an idea of what the pie of
wrongness was and is generally 99% of their problem their fault and maybe that little sliver of the pie was my contribution to have things went wrong it generally is not that where the pies actually cut up and I just see I just see things from my perspective so a big part if I want to move forward in future relationships and to have just peace of mine is to say well what could I have done differently
 what what did I let what were the red flags I did not say because I had a rose colored glasses
 and am I start
 the problem with the problem is when I start taking responsibility I can't tell my story of well any longer
 the more I tell my story of well this happened to Melinda this happened because tuba this happened to me Jamie step dojo this happen to meet Martin all these things happen to me what it does it mean
fix my story concrete
 it makes it like Stone it makes it like the absolute truth when in reality
 is the partial truth
 and I do have some responsibility
 and if I don't own that responsibility and I just tell my story of Woe I will I will smuggle my shortcomings
 it's my future relationships is it possible that this person didn't have any ownership in that like they got cheated on and they didn't do anything wrong
 often times they have like Coda meetings for the alcoholics because there is a responsibility in the person who often times people know about cheating but they just don't want to believe it I'm not saying she does but it's good to do some hard introspection I've dealt with people
been in relationship with people who are addicts for like 10 years and they were just like I will not accept that they're addicts
 and and do try to bail them out of their addiction is a classic codependence I'm not saying this is her but it's worth analyzing because if you have that people pleasing nature to begin with then you shutdown your intuition on so many levels
 I'm saying it's worth it to go forward chili sausage and any on that maybe you do have a maybe you do have let's go with that maybe you maybe it's a hundred percent their fault the next question is
 what does God want me to get out of this
 what can I how is this not putting me in bondage and ruining me but how is this liberating me
 and those are good questions to ask what is this going to give me now
 and often times
 when everything gets taken
that's a really great time to reach out to God
 if not
 maybe that's the High Life
 times when things are working out smooth it's the last time I'm thinking about God's doing this for me usually I've got my life in control I'm in control matter fact as devotees we sort of
 glorify being a little destitute she's like I'm losing my parents and my sister and I'm a little broke right now we glorify that destitution cuz we see now I'm depending on you Krishna now comes as very very heartfelt prayers of
 oh my Lord I know I haven't perhaps I had some responsibility in this perhaps I was blinded by a faction perhaps I was naive but here I am
 what would you like for me now
 here I'm putting myself at your feet what would you like for me to please give
let me shut my anger down for a moment so I can hear your whisper or direct me in a very loud way that's one thing that's the Divine way to look at it the next thing would be
 take a year off
 adult cuz this is what people really go bad is a state they just jump into another relationship cuz there's nothing better than masking your emotions with a new Romance
 take a year off and just think and then after a month after month you're going to find out I met this guy this guy is great that's not but that's not the great guy get go go through a year of just introvert introspection journaling finding responsibility for Direction
 doing some self-searching
 and Kristen will send you the right guy
or maybe not
 or maybe not a Christian I'll put you in the right situation let's face it you're about to like bond with this guy forever and he lived a completely Second Life
 thank God but maybe just had one incident or who don't know he was leading a completely second life well he wouldn't he was a previous addict I don't know but his track record doesn't sound great
 and he was about to get married and he was having an affair if I was hiring I would not have that resume would not look so good
 I'm just saying we don't know that he was having a extended Affair or anything like that we don't know but it may be important for her to examine or picker
 do you have a broken picker
 she's with this guy for 12 years I understand
if it made we should have to go back a long way to get into her pick her up
 record but I suppose I think it's I think it's important in a situation like this where you deal with a person in recovery that you deal any of us all the clues she gave you have an affair right before the wedding and denied it
 like he's going to go into a wedding he's going to go married and he's going to keep that one secret as the foundation of their love, I think it's always safe to say when things are going south or sour we should examine is my picker broken
 I think it's these are not like holding hurt so I can run out now I'm totally screwed up it's important to find out where I have some responsibility in this as well as forward from what we're reading for all we know
 this is actually real
nice guy you know he had some trouble with addiction with that doesn't mean he's not a good person and he cheated one time we don't know that he was living second life or you was you know thoroughly dishonest time and lying about it is dishonest examine that and I tell you if I was your father I'd say get rid of this guy for good you know
 okay I wouldn't be as lenient as you are if I'm not being lenient with your dad or her I'm not I'm not being lenient at all I'm not I'm not saying anything about what to do but I'm just I'm just I don't want to read into it that's my point so what do I had to get over and had to work through it and had to move forward with it it seems safe to go to revenge and Spite and resentment don't go there move flowers
Christian has handed everything I've been in what appears as tragedy but we all know now is his in tragic this is a blessing you were released before you before you step in that like elephant pet where it seemed safe and then you just fall into a pit you've been saved you've been saved thank God
 and then you want to really get rid of resentment and pray for this person's deep spiritual connection
 thank you brother
 thank you I'm so sorry you're going through that Prabhu not you probably owe her Prabhu yeah I don't even want to get into it but there was a time that my heart was hurt so bad I thought I was going to lose my mind I thought I was going to lose my mind
 but what
without going too big long thing more than anything what helps you not lose your mind
 you don't usually taken shelter devotees and in asking similar questions when she asked
 and she's on the right track
 yeah
 sometimes in cuz it was at a time another time where I couldn't get out of it like I was going to have to actually leave
 and runs from the game again give him good advice he said sometimes when you're unsure
 you just have to stay in it
 when there's no nothing super obvious or there's mint sometimes you can't just get out of relationship even when things were really bad and so we came to this advice he said you know in my life I would let through a very very tough time I should have to deal with it and he explained the whole situation and he said you know what I did I waited I waited till became very very obvious what I was supposed to do
I was like okay I got a little children involved and I'm not sure what I should do they said would you just wait I go how long did you wait for you guys I'm waiting for 10 years and I'm like 40 minutes okay bye now I know what you got the answer in retrospect I waited like 13 and sometimes we don't want to make his choices we want to actually fully because we make a c twice as we're not doing it on Christmas Direction often we're doing it on impulse and that's usually never great outcome impulse choices okay okay we have more questions to answer today
 alright my friend they want to read one yep
 this is from Sherry hammock no it's not it's from Sherry know it's me Chris
yes okay thank you I forgot those other names this is not from I hope you're not about to read the one that we just read this is MI several year journey through bhakti I have come across 30s who espouse a belief that pro-pot was the last ability that could be a teacher or initiate people
 initiate people to this year's are the others can be teachers
 it seems to fly in the face of the believe in discipline succession that is referenced in the Bhagavad Gita all the way down to the great teachers in our lineage in over the last several hundred years I'm a little confused as something changed with The Disappearance of probable pod is there something mention in his teachings or the teachings of his teachers that ends that dips
succession what am I missing a great question cuz this is a thing unless you get into bhakti especially within this movement or proud papa is such a dynamic acharya who spread the teaching beta culture throughout the entire world and then he left the plant right away and almost like almost like a parent dies so to speak but a bunch of children are wandering around would I do without my parent and he left but all was these books some people are like you don't need a guru anymore we have his books
 Socastee I love to hear your answer for this
 right left a bunch of basically Young new devotees to run an international society and some of them couldn't handle the pressure of Fame and worship becoming a guru and it's a certain people just they lost faith in everything is so you know what this is nonsense I'm at
here we're going to do our own thing we're probably the guru and that's it boss no more well they're claiming that they have in first of all let's get back per second and say that you know our whole thing when it comes to the practice of Krishna bhakti is that this is a lineage of Bucky vedanta right it's practice the way that they don't has been practice going back to its beginning the way that it's written in these Timeless text is that it's something that's handed down from Guru to disciple
 the disciple becomes a groomer has it down to the next disciple that's how it becomes a guru India has it down to the next disciple that goes on we say that it's been going after that's the way the test that's why it's hot in that to his practice
 their their claim is that proper change that that because he's so
 influential
and empowered and realized that he has the authority to change that
 it's a very very bold claim
 and I'll say in my opinion but just very objectively
 it's it's it's not a well-founded claim it's red it's resting on light is it's like taking this incredible heavyweight and resting it on like a tiny little pin you know the way that they explain it is that there was historically as she'll probably got older in the last year of his life it was four months or so before he passed away that he had written a letter now
 there's there's different you know some weeks back I don't think you were here right now I think it was when you were traveling to Italy
but we interview Brew pod purple
 Parkwood read a book on the growing area by Stevenson and we discuss the different models of Bruce sometimes Bruce like a person in a village like a a married person in a village that's got like 10 disciples and then there's a kind of like this idea of like a jug of glue this person that travels widely and has thousands and thousands of that's true the problem he had thousands of disciples and he was constantly moving constantly traveling and so as that you do as he started to to have more more disciples and he was always on the run you might be in a place in the world where you're never even going to see him again but you have complete faith your your hearing from his disciples you're reading his books or Charlie inspired by him and you wish to become his disciple
 and what would happen that is usually like that the temple leaders
having examined your character in your sincerity would reach out to show the proper wherever he was in the world and say hey we have 10 people here that wanted to come your disciples
 and rather than wait for him to come through that area the world again what you might not even do
 then probably say okay the did the leaders in that place can do can on my behalf perform the rituals of the ceremony of initiation so so those Temple leaders would do the things that are normally the guru do himself like chant on the beads that are given to the to the initiate
 give the person a name they would usually suggest the name
 perform the the actual ceremony and perform the actual ritual when it's done and so those those Temple leaders of righteous shall probably okay we feel that these people are
qualify to to become your disciples and then the right to profit probably say Okay I accept them
 and now you perform the rituals you chat on the beads they would suggest a name he would accept that name and that was that process was going on for quite some time
 now what happened was what what what these are I'll call them literally objectively there conspiracy theorists right they have a theory of a conspiracy that took place where they're saying they say that on there was a letter the proper role where he was very old now he was four years from passing four months from passing away and he was he couldn't travel and he would it seem like it was it was becoming clear he's entering the final months of his life
 and so on his order one of his disciples wrote a letter that he signed that said prop has instructed us that there's going to be a new method
are they let let me put this way that there's going to be an adjustment to this method and essentially adjustment was in the past the temple leaders would write appropriate and say we suggest this person and probably would say I accept them
 now prop had was giving them the full authority to accept them themselves on his behalf
 so the idea was they wouldn't even have to ask for the property if he accepts them probably saying I trust he's 11 people he named 11 people I trust them they can do it all you just send us their names so that we keep track of them but they don't even have to turn to me and asked me if I accept them I accept them based on their acceptance and and within that letter there was one word and it said henceforth right this is the way we'll be doing things henceforth I didn't even write that word that was written by what
probably discipleship compose the letter right probably sign the letter authorized 11 but what they're saying was that when he said henceforth he never changed it
 so he gave him they're saying he gave a model where in other people perform the rituals
 but they do it on his behalf and they remain Sheila propods disciples and then he passed away for months later and he never took that back now what that means is that
 she'll probably do something incredibly drastic in different than it had ever been done in the history of of of these Bucky lineages and that's completely against everything that he wrote in his volumes and volumes and volumes and volumes of books of teachings so
 far more reasonable approach has to understand that this letter not written by Sheila Pappas used a colloquialism
where's that henceforth if you want to get real specific I should have said henceforth until proper dies
 this is the way that we're going to do things but that would have been in poor taste and it was nobody was thinking that anyone could possibly misinterpret this so that this is where we're doing it from here on out and you don't even if you want to get really technical say said henceforth will then you then you have to say Okay henceforth in other words you're saying let's be incredibly literal and how we interpret this even though it goes against everything that he ever taught
 but if you want to get so little then he appointed 11 people to play that role what happens once I was 11 people die then there's nothing left so it's kind of a but it's it's silly
 you know it and I believe what you are saying is that it's an emotional response because some of those gurus who initiated disciples going forward had so many
and they're saying this is evidence that they're not following that order and and so therefore the whole thing is is being disrupted so it's it you know if you go. I'll say this I bet some people that this could we call it the ritvik philosophy right because of the word ritvik and it's a it's a word that refers to the a priest who does a ritual on behalf of another right and so the idea is that these people aren't actually gurus themselves they're just performing a ritual and from here on out for the rest of History these people will be what what whatever an issue, historically in this line will be
 direct Disciples of Sheila Prophet rather than Grand disciples are great grand disciples like that
 I've met people that subscribe to this idea that a really sweet wonderful people
 and I've also met people are the most wild cancel
Mercy theorist that I received there is but I was going to take it one step further and say some of the most bitter hardage downright offensive people is perfect for them it's all they need to point the finger in and create the conspiracy and say look at these people that did this one with a he could sometimes be fine especially today that a lot of these conspiracy theories but it is safe to say I'm using the word as it's meant to be it's a conspiracy theory it's a theory of a conspiracy now is that doesn't mean that it's wrong but it's definitely conspiracy theory and
 I find the people that accept it usually accept every other conspiracy theory that exist and if they accept it and I accept a lot of conspiracy theorist jumping with a place near what I find at the American even look at the vast amount of spiritual Tasha I want to take my personal experiences
as I've met devotees in my life I've changed I've watched myself grow I've watched myself become a better person more regulated more sense controlled more God conscious I treat myself better treat other people better I've actually witnessed radical change in my life and I can and I'm suspecting it'll continue to the to the amount of this info and lifestyle that I am by
 it's a living growing organism my bhakti you know and so what makes me think
 that I won't become a Pure devotee one day that we never liked that they will all be a money but if this is really working I will also become a great Soul that's what might my hopes is and maybe not in this life but maybe in my next life maybe if I'm very focused maybe tomorrow but the idea is that this stuff works we don't just get it initiated and then we stay stagnant like you're you're
planting a seed to plant we're planting seeds not marbles we grow immediately and the idea that that this jug of glue to this issue the problem make the seed grow into pure devotees isn't that what they were supposed to do is that the girls I think it was going to say. Both of you guys stayed down there in the basement is always thinking how can I make this devotees become pure devotees and then take this then further it with everybody else become qualified gurus and I'm seeing it happen in my life and the lives of friends and and end in students etcetera watching them grow and I know that people that aren't necessarily liberated Souls but great people dedicated to ba chi have changed my life to just Krishna is working through everybody at the even even newer devoted Christian Works through the new devotees to spread the holy name and uplift people
relative your point here is is is really printed I just want to add a little something to do tonight and I would there's a couple of things more they're like to read about the spice it up polish it I just extended
 it is you have similar arguments coming from within the Gaudi Vice everything is like sometimes they say this particular lineage that were part of is not valid because within the links of the chain that we have some of the guru's some of the relationship between Google and it said we're not deeksha
 initiations they were actually shiksha relationships right they were not done through the formal ritual but they were a teacher that was just sharing the teaching now our belief is that teachings that are the sacred thing that's being passed through this a die so it doesn't matter if you were initiated by that person or not but the real thing is as you were saying it's kind of like looking at a tree that's giving fruits and saying that she's not alive
he said he know it's a lie because it's because I don't feel like we have to argue about this or what are you growing in your body. Are you getting it from other people is it come from property and is it coming from people who came before proud but yes we give you all credit to Guru but you get credited the guru guru as well as true as well it doesn't diminish probably pod prod pod was a in the charger that spread this all over the world and we worship Him and love him and appreciate him for that
 now here's here's what I really I just want to really emphasize that let's take this on to the real irrational level I'm going to read one exit of a letter that Sheila Prophet wrote this was written to decide when they push to Krishna your 1975 any rights that says keep trained up very rigidly
 and then you are bona fide Guru right he didn't say you have
that the he said you're well trained rigidly you're following is a true follower of this path then you're then you're a bona fide Guru and he said and you can accept disciples on the same principle because I'm following I can accept his disciples and teach them how to follow that's what I'd everybody thank you. It is the custom that during the lifetime of your spiritual Master you bring the perspective disciples to him and in his absence or disappearance you can accept disciples without limitation any says this this is the law of the cyclic succession I want to see my disciples become bona fide spiritual Masters and spread Krishna conscious is very widely that'll make me and Krishna very happy now this is just one example that is that ends the whole conversation it should but they're going to say that no that letter came after
this letter so he changed it but here's my point should have probably said that I haven't done anything special the only thing is that I've never changed anything right he would speak like that I'm just a representative and I never changed anything this was his whole Legacy that he presented the lineage of Krishna bhakti in a way that people could understand it and access it without changing it and so to think that he would drastically dramatically change it at the last within the last four months of his life if he were going to do that he wouldn't just put it wouldn't all rest on one tiny little fragile lynchpin of the word henceforward in a letter that was hardly anybody would ever read he would have said everybody were changing everything now you know everything that I said before it has been reconsidered and I want everyone to understand that we're taking on a whole new method of the sea
succession that will go on indefinitely into the centuries from here on forward that's what he would have done if he was going to make such a drastic change that's just rational thinking to think that he changed everything on the basis of one small little colloquialisms sitting in a letter is absurd and if you want it again if you want to take that literally then you have to accept that 11 people that he appointed to do that we're the only people that he ever pointed to do that and when they die the hold a sip of succession is finished you know so it's that's why I said you know I don't want to be disrespectful but it's kind of a silly kind of things that has the one you know this is something that we talked about a lot you know when you have attachments it clouds the clarity of your perception and so someone is feeling a lot of angst towards leaders that had a lot of trouble made a lot of mistakes
 offended people as well you know defended their own
brothers and so on then you can find that little word and make everything rests on it as if that were Prop Hunt changing centuries of of this obsession with out telling us except in that one little insignificant know if he was going to make such a huge change he would have been explicit about it and he would have gone into great detail and shared it widely because he had written a whole he had written so many books teaching the exact opposite so it's it's kind of absurd to think that people who have been betrayed Ben-Hur is especially in an in their early formative years in spite of his abandoned and abandoned in a parent that that they grow up with the narrative that humans can't be trusted this there's this kid people will leave you people will betray you people are not
trustworthy if that is the running narrative in the psyche and then you go through your life and you find a person and she left me or he left me or or you find a spiritual institution where like here is this holy person and it's a holy person in his holy teachings and he says you should invest a lot in these teachers and then all the sudden the teacher leaves that is The Perfect Storm the purpose for me to drum up my narrative artsy people aren't meant to be trusted I trusted him and they let me down and this will be a reoccurring theme in their life and then they they Madonna eyes a person wipe rod pod at because he's he's alive and he's perfect he can't do any wrong these are the same people Prop Hunt was here very often they would end up finding fault with them him because they're looking to be correct they're looking to say you know what people will let you down I mean I'm sure you have people in your life that it look
I have that looked up to you love you. Anything for you I practically a disciple our students are a fan or whatever and then something happens and you don't even know what it was you don't do anything differently all of a sudden your response you are probably giving me number one you are never sincere you are never you have no good qualities whatsoever
 can have his they have this narrative running through their head people are meant to let you down if you don't get enough people in this world and enter to fill out the contacts even a bit more I think that this is a dynamic that plays out in practically all you no religious Traditions that like for instance within Christianity
 you know originally there's the Catholic church and the Catholic Church are saying the pope is your kind of I forget to turn that they use but he's kind of like the intermediary between the self and God
that we say something similar we say not one Pope but that the way the process works is that there's a chain of of discipline succession there's a chain of God disciples and we serve God and access God through them through their teachings and Inns by being connected with them and I'm in the lineage then there's always comes around people later like Martin Luther who wants to remove the intermediary say that that's just man imposing his his will in between God and the soul
 and and they need to be removed now within our tradition though it's written into the tradition very explicitly
 like Christian I'll say one who says that my divorce is not mad about it but one of the devotee of might have already there make sure nobody else like that idea is like it's very well pronounced and you know very much elaborated on in this tradition that we wanted to come down acid acid. So I know. So that
we always see there's an intermediary between us and God that we please God by pleasing the devotees of God that and that's how we connect it's a very strong part of our of our tradition in our philosophy
 so it doesn't work well to just say you can throw that all out the window this so much so much has been shared by the charges of this as well as the original Source text themselves through and decided the prop I didn't throw all that away again Prop Hunt was saying his legacy is that he didn't change it and for someone to come along and say he changed it all at the last second and he didn't even really communicated why they just included in this little letter with this one word henceforth it's it's it's an incredibly weak argument
 what's good I thought he dressed then
I wouldn't even mind if people believed it but when I come to a spiritual institution I'm expecting two people to be on their A-game meaning you don't criticize you don't find fault that's what I find when I meet people are into that they have so much deep rooted animosity and be not everyone that I met but not everybody but a lot of the people I can't figure it out I think just believe it then and go on and be a nice devotee they're all fake really every one of them speak and I knew them personally and you didn't like I got the message they're all they're all charlatans there it's it's like you could tell they just got you don't want I don't want to go to a spiritual Community to hear people like that and then either so it would do it if that's what you believe do your thing where she expected from a little bit of a distance
100 m out okay mister that's it that's it that's it
