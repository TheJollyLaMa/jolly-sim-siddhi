 you know

I guess unless there's any more announcements last call for Italy that's all I'm going to say last call for Italy want to go with us to Italy you can do it
 the first one to bring an old friend of mine part 2 Star to welcome to the show in right outside of Amsterdam now right yeah yeah it really nice area away from the city yeah it is now he's an endurance athlete and on his trip to bhakti he was in the Uber deployed twice in the Iraq War I was in Iraq for five years like basically 3 towards there and then I had three tours in the Balkans as well during the genocide. God
 this is what I do I will get to that
what's oppressive are welcome to the podcast and I'm glad we reconnected we just randomly started talking to each other again and I know it is an interesting guy with some interesting realizations and you know I think also the one thing that we had in our conversation was the ups and downs of practicing bhakti for many years often times people think I'm going to open the pocket doors just going to be Blissful but there's so many twists and turns in your bhakti life also some people some people that you depend on let you down you know where something happened or some weird thing that situation that it may be broke your heart or something or maybe you had some personal struggles until our bacta path is generally not a straight line but I think when we were speaking the other day and you went through some twists and turns we won't get into it and now but I was thinking yeah he had so many twists and turns but here
yes you know you decades later and you're still playing the game and is quite that's quite beautiful to witness because it's not like the materialist doesn't get twists and turns in their life everybody's getting a Twist no one gets a pass from pain from the reversals of life from your heartbreak for people letting you down from false hopes etcetera so I'm still good to see you here with a strong focus and keeping the main thing the main thing for Boo store inside each of these
 difficult easy to each of these obstacles each of these terms in a road it just gives us another chance to actually internalized I'll hold spirituality right like because otherwise it's just a theoretical knowledge if you can actually apply it to it to yourself until you search within yourself it's just be
how can I get past all of these are North is in the hearts all these really deep deep deep seeded unwanted aspects unless you're confronted by them and advancement exactly I did this whole thing on forgiveness call the six pillars of bhakti yoga and one is the importance of like you do not taking offense to bother people so about forgiveness and whenever I make some declaration like you must forgive I feel like Krishna directly sends me a person to screw with me and then it was an Eminem just like okay and I'm trying to feed a radically write something but at the same time I have this person who's driving me insane and then I have to sort of it whenever we make that step up like I'm going to go to the next level and bhakti I'm going to like hate this Theory and in claim that
damn this Theory and I should tell everybody else about this wonderful Theory then I get challenge with that very declaration in my own life and exactly exactly I had that also where I felt personally I felt that I didn't appreciate the bike shelves anymore I didn't appreciate the devotees anymore so you really appreciate them and he cut his face like I'm sick of these guys they don't have their act together because I'm an extreme type of person and so then I took her for 12 years to stay away from them and to just practice on my own
 praying all that time at that love for them comes back again and it only then will I coming back into Association when I feel that that feeling has entered the heart of appreciation of wanting to see them to wanting to associate with them and only then will I come back
the association when it's like when you're in the desert and somebody offers you a piece of stale bread and some water it's the greatest thing in the world so it was kind of like this meditation of being in the in the desert of suffering and just what I couldn't what I was starving to death taking whatever more so I can get in be appreciative of it nice how did that work out it was actually amazing I felt like not that I would go back fully into constant Association but it taught me a lesson that a lot of the times our is our ego or our own our own stock that keeps us from wanting to see the good in others it's actually just us and what we feel and what we see and and how we take things you know I think that's
 an important important section a season of some some of us life mine included which is where the Tri-State you step away from the association
the bodies and then there's that really Romancing Krishna like you did when you were a brand new devotee and I went through that phase to where I was like okay I've been out of Krishna conscious you know I went through like a three-year stale. Where I just wasn't living up to the Integrity I wanted to live and I couldn't even it is humiliating to say but I couldn't even call myself at the body cuz I don't want to seem like a hypocrite so I just considered myself you know what I'm just not a devotee and Krishna kept on sending me devotees will be like but it's still I kept my distance and then I got to this point where I was like you know what I want the association of devotees but not too much so I got an apartment I want to get an apartment near the LA Temple and I had like fire department to choose from and all of them were like four blocks away from the LA Temple except one was right across the street
and all of them fell through except the one right across the street and I was like okay this is Christmas plan and it was the best planet ever happened so yeah we had a Christmas gives us less the leash go as much as we want to go and then he pulls us back as much as as much as we want to go back it's a matter of right like Krishna doesn't need your your vulgar Krishna doesn't need your you know Pooja by Krishna only Chris the only thing I want is honesty and I feel like once I never went to that. Where I gave up Krishna Consciousness I just worshipped my dear I was on my own I chanted by myself I read by myself I just I just created this internal desire and motivation but the one thing I focused on was to be honest and say these are my faults
 this is Nicole. This is the bad I accept you you accept me
minutes becomes a healthy relationship which I feel is necessary you have to have a healthy relationship it can't be built on the old it can't be built on fear and has to be built on genuine honesty and love I love that I love that it had to do a lot with one of her questions yesterday a person also struggling with the association not actually struggling with a Christian but just happy with where they're at but no no intense urgency to get any deeper than he was but thank you for sharing that so what was your initial stage of coming to bhakti how did you first find Christian in your life and what were you into and had a Krishna answer of those prayers
 well I grew up in the in New York and I in the 80s and the 90s riding BMX you know why I printed the first T-shirts from Murphy's Law at a bike shop with my friend Luigi
same to you in like biohazard like the first biohazard shirts like we printed them in a bike shop I worked at when I was like 12 or 13 years old or something so you know I knew of like hardcore I knew of these things I was into Punk fast forward at when I join the military yeah it wasn't until 1999 that I was I saw it as I have questions about the world and what does the world mean or what is the goal of it and just buy some instant cuz I was traded somebody sent me a book that was a conversation with you in such a rush and then that kind of sure that was a book released a conversation book right now with site your eyes for Bill who's one of my initial mentors and bhakti and that kind of put me on
 no coming back from the vet appointment that's what I really do
why didn't you even though I was still in the Army I decided that said this is what I want to do I want to just dive into this process because it made sense like the bug of agita is an amazing book every answer in life can be explained in the bhagavad-gita Reno Karma why we suffer what's the goal of life so just every everything is there in a bag of Akita and so that really kicked it off where I was living in Germany at the time station there and that's what I join the temple and I just lived in this dull life of of being at the voting and then I heard you joined the temple while
 you're still live in the temple living in the army camp would walk around the army base in like you do Dr with t lock in life and
and I wasn't the whole time I was in the military as if I show up I never hit it like when it later on in my career when you know why I was a senior ranking I would worship Cholla drive down there in front you do right there on top of vehicles are at my desk in my office the shaligram is the stone the stones from the Kentucky River an iPod which can be worshipped as Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna so you had these shaligram is with you while you're so I didn't like I never I never kind of shying away I just said like no Christmas in perfectly perfectly so I had this nature to be a soldier I was quite good at it I was quite technically and tactically sound at it so I thought well okay then just do it but don't hide who I am actually so I would instead of taking 30 days like leave and going to visit my parents I would go on traveling safe
and I would just that that's like my whole life was just asked for time means you jump in a van with a bunch of other guys and you distribute books on the streets of whatever Germany Eindhoven in Hamburg
 so that was that was just how it was it just was in an integrated part of my life it was like you know you way too much and then you go to the Army and do physical training and then at the end you go back to the temple wait a second so you had Mangal aarti at the temple or at the army base I'm just trying to get my head in Nuremberg Germany so I I was in Bamberg which was only about an hour away by car so I would think I would go to the temple and then I would come back and then I would just do the Army all day and then in the evening I would go back to the Temple of Time allowed due to life
no problems or other things that were going on but for the most part that's was any waking moment I was there staying in the temple wow you know I'm trying to just get my head around the type of people in the Army and I don't want to be at make a generalization but it doesn't seem like they're the most embracing group for a white guy walking around in a Doe D at the Army at the base can't look like how how did your fellow soldiers look at you treat you or they like a pretty cool or like I mean to me being in the Army remind probably something was like in junior high school where you get a bunch of boys picking on you making fun of you and you have to defend yourself and what was it like though actually I need from me it wasn't so bad I was already at NCO so like I was already in charge of people so nobody ever treated me bad they always gave me you know tons of facility like when I was in Iraq that you gave me my own my own place to stay
they were like well you have your spiritual practice wow and we don't want anybody to really bother you so you're welcome here's our own space you know your own room to live in and they just always kind of accepted it and they just said okay like this is who he is it doesn't affect his job it doesn't affect how he performs so what's the problem and they just thought I was a little weird but then everybody in the Army's weird so it's like there's nobody so it's just it's just levels of Crazy by the way this is I just want to jump in that's a great it's a great example of like when you just say you know what this is what I am you deal with it and instead of being like is it okay to be this is it okay to be that in the world is caught in this almost like asking permission for them to be themselves and you just or claimed it in the United States Army just made space for you
practice what you want to practice unabashedly. That's very impressive I think I was the only practicing go to your bike shop in the whole US military at that point and and I would bring up many things to the chaplain like why is it that you have all these other books but you don't have the bug of agita like why is it that you're not providing for me in a box in the Army are they wait what the people who print bag of Adidas
 did what they sold $15,000 us into the US Army because you don't even have my book available that I follow you have
doctoral you have a crush on you have you know the Bible you have everything even Buddhists literature but you'll have nothing for me and so so yeah so then they created the facility for me they allowed me to space to engage in and not just that but also to give classes to talk to people it was a very it wasn't hitting thing that I was like this item is very open to in the Army the chaplain does multi denominations or is there a chaplain preach religion OK Google Christian chaplain but they have to provide for every one of their specialty will be you know Christian or Muslim but they have to provide spiritual guidance for everybody. Did you see the thing about devotees and I'm looking at everybody on the zoom screen right now is
 a lot of times you practice bhakti and whether you like it or not people start to
come ask you for questions I think people on our on our Zoom board with all of a sudden we get this position of being a chaplain or a guru or a teacher without us even asking for it did you find that in with the other people especially cuz you're going in these sort of life-threatening situations where you know they say no one is an atheist in the Foxhole or something like that
 yeah I know right now yeah I had a lot of conversations I had a lot of talk so you know during my time to deploy. I did programs and I did like you know programs in the war and in a practical sense like I just showed them like this is what if I show up is a violation of his liberal person on the planet just the most accepting and loving person and so for me for me I took that serious. I should have these qualities and people should see
can see these qualities of fairness so focused on determination of trust so I tried my best to guide people and someone someday were some successful there is some like for out things that happen like at the time of death they were all kinds of crazy things are a lot of time of death situations
 I mean they were there were a handful I mean there was like
 yeah there was some here couple that are appropriate that are that hat that end with a positive note please positive note but I did see people leave their bodies
 and just totally alone and focused and you know they would leave with like a I had this okay cuz I was like what I thought like what are they going to do
like what's the US government going to do to me if I just go all out like what are they going to do the worst they can do is send me home right like I said like that's the worst thing about Harry Krishna yeah like I was just like all right so I used to travel when I go on missions with my body armor I would have an Uber in the shinga day of Sheila Schaller G Sheila with me on that we're studying is a stone that has like a jagged hole in it which they call this isn't a string of Dave Shiela so it's like having a deity of Lauren the string there that he's caring now I would do that too I would care that destroying their she live with me as well as rights are you carrying this Sheila with you
 but I also had like a little other little packet it had like younger water and have ironically water and it had Tulsi leaves and stuff like that so yeah like it happened where people left there in a multiple casualty incidents where people left their body
you know I was able to put a Shala G on their head and put some salsa in their mouth like right before the moment of death and you see that the peacefulness over the face even though that the language wasn't understood wow what seeing the peacefulness that at the end of life that's all everybody wants they just want reassurance that whatever happens in their next life whatever happens at the end is going to be positive and so somehow Krista used me as an imperfect vehicle to help others
 and it wasn't just there it was like you know there was another kid who who
 left his body and an aspirin initiation at the right before he left and I gave it to him I was like you know David's found out your big toe
what's the smartest thing you could do is beautiful and so realizing that this is it and weaving that life behind is it's empowering and it leaves an image that leaves like a mental image in your head about how precious gift of life is and how precious being in love is like we have learning how to to prepare for death by living in a certain way or I think a lot of times in especially Western culture where we're not seeing War like right in front of my face you can forget that
 people die you can live a life in such a way where are you really pushed away tragedy and you sort of live in a bubble of like
is good here and now I'm going to go on vacation on top of my good and then where would we forget about the temporality of existence and the pain of existence and the suffering goes on and you are in a position where it's like oh I get it
 it's going to be them it's going to be made soon as it got next to me you never know what the next moment is going to bring you it wasn't easy because like you do during that timeframe my spiritual Mentor stepped away which left me alone in this environment with no would know nobody to guide me even though through the internet so you know there was that there was I just want to explain what that means so he had a spiritual teacher for the spiritual teacher fell away and so so he's now torn like what do I do here I am at you must feel like almost like a bandit
yeah and you're trying to process this like I think of anybody even if they're that have a very normal healthy environment but their teacher has some struggles and they and they end up leaving the path that is self is confusing it's even exponentially more confusing when you're in the middle of a battlefield and trying to make sense of it because I've always been on my own I have a feeling or I have an idea that at one point in our spiritual lives we have to create our own inspiration and motivation that open to a certain point we we can't we can't depend on others to motivate us to inspire us the continue but at one point you have to you have to fly your own airplane at one point you have to be
 firmly fixed in in faith in the process that even if those external circumstances change that you will continue to follow your path and not
that's a beautiful that's a beautiful I feel like a next space and bhakti we're like even if there's nobody around anywhere I'm still a devotee of Lord Krishna and that's all I want and sometimes we got it have to get boosted by a community but yeah we have to also have that determination like no this is actually what I am this is actually what gives me joy and laughter there is no hope of materialism at all material world world is crumbling around me we have to really become fit and I think I don't know if it's just your born like this some people really helps to write the realizations down because the way mi works as we tend to forget and it's it's beautiful to hear those convictions no matter what the material world throws at you to have that conviction is like our next phase of getting fixed in bhakti yoga and and and in in spiritual life
 it's necessary it's
necessary it's like I've been through a lot man I've been through a lot in my life even post-military you know I was I was in South Africa as a monk at that time I was poisoned in South Africa want to share something like it's just like everything else like you know somebody didn't agree and and decided to take something into their own hands and and that's okay you know it's all just Karma being burned and things like that but the idea is like
 Nothing Stops us right Nothing Stops us the only aspect that starts us is us like we decide when to give up we decide when to quit we decide how much we want to apply the philosophy to our hearts like it can be either a little bit or a lot of it but it's up to us nobody can force us nobody can make
I love that we live in a world where it's very easy to say well this is a triggering environment or this is not a safe environment I guess what the whole world isn't safe it's up to me to decide if I'm going to choose to be Krishna conscious today or not be and I can't let the account with the situation the environment the people at cetera it's just like me and God and everybody in my family can walk away from me or my friends can walk away from me right but you're in your case your teacher left and you know I'm still have to be Krishna Consciousness it's a beautiful sentiment and conviction and I think from those statements of that's just the way it is Universe this is where I'm going it's almost like like you made that choice in the Army I'm just a devotee of Lord Krishna deal with it it's like okay Universe you do whatever you want but this is my connection to have that firm
 I don't know if you have that firm from being a new devotee or not but that is what it's going to take to make it through this crazy world of twists and turns
you know that's the whole idea of doing deep spiritual practices is to come to the stage of complete faith in in a process right it's not just the simply days are social media you see it quite often you know people take selfies with enchanting the holy name and it's like no you're not you're taking a selfie the whole point of me isn't it
 no
 at one point at one point we just have to go deeper that's the whole idea it's like it at one point we have to go deeper into the into the ocean of all of boxing to be able to get the full enjoyment out of entertainment out of it a message to the people out there next time you take that stuff if you Channing right underneath it here's me going deeper
 post
fly through three why am I even going deeper scroll right to go deeper then just touch my face clenched up that we live in where it's like we were so perfect focus on external practices sure that we put no focus on the internalized practice of getting to the authentic self you know like that's the whole idea is to practice Krishna Consciousness so that we can figure out like who we really are too so get rid of all the dirt in the heart of darkness in the heart of all the dust and all the gunk that's there to be able to see the natural position of Austin which is the servant of all living entities
 Super Bowl did you see a lot of people or were you with and where you sort of death Doula eating people as they were leaving or was it just one random one
it was a few times like it was a few times that I just happen to be there at the wrong place at the right time and
 and tried in some way to help
 them transition
 and somehow I was used as an imperfect tool right with all my faults and all my my crap that I deal with and somehow Krista allowed me to the present day or so that I could help in some way whether it is just champing to them quickly and their year as they go War while or putting your hologram on their head or just you know doing today in the area they left in and then sanctifying in the area so it's already like you're so you know I was just thinking about what is the karma of that person that they had to go through some material I
reasonably young probably under 35 and then
 it could very easily be like there were some Advanced spiritual person in a previous life they had to do one more dealing with the material body again and at a time of death a man will come to you with the shaligram Sheila Put on your foot to put it on your head and you'll go back and never know we never know who were face-to-face with even though they may have performed material activities you never knew actually who you're face-to-face with where you got back they have the Good Fortune of someone chanting in your ear at the time of death some of that you didn't even plan for you didn't you didn't it's a cross between having an incredibly incredible position on the wheel of samsara like now is a time to deal with this body one more time and also incredible mercy of the devotees we're just going out of their way to give a lot of love in a place where you should really sort of keeping your head a lot lower and maybe
be a little bit more quiet you're just sort of going out and giving a lot of love and a tragic situation but that's the worst Airline but I flew on Air India and loving being an Indian on the in the air element TVs work was coming up and down I was at fron and and she came up and she was like a doctor and I looked at her as I look like one that's like what happened and she said oh somebody died in up here and so on the flight somebody died I will not going to turn around because we're already like six hours into the flight so we're just going to keep going and then with a body
people sitting on either side it was pretty funny and she from okay well at least you died for their violation of this life were from a previous life they always arranged they never he never forgets that's the beauty of having a relationship with him it's one of
 I'll complete appreciation and love what he doesn't say like what have you done for me lately he remembers even the smallest offering you can made from a previous life that's beautiful I feel that for sure I even seen sometimes the opposite happens a person goes to vrindavan like I'm sick I'm going to die and something happens in Randolph and where they have to go to Delhi and they leave the body
Deli yes your those situations where it's Earl I can make a plan for but it's not a plan it's it's not your plan it's Christmas plan it's krishna's plan depending on where your hearts at and Christian and knows our Chris knows our heart and he knows where we're cheating as well. The eagle was so strong that the eagle says like all of My Success all of my life everything is because of my abilities but actually know it's all who are we were just like a little piece of sand and grain of sand in time and all of it emanates from Krishna all of it comes from him all our strengths and all have our weaknesses everything comes from him is the source of everything and so little of that a little grain of sand in time I know we we tend to think even our our good fortune and even the tragic even the most trash
can we hear about people live live from birth tragic lives even that is a greatest it's a blink of the eye it within a year of your life perhaps it's a blink of an eye and we we tend to that sounds like spiritual bypassing but it's also reality in the bigger scheme of thing it's a blink of an eye and I know that because in this lifetime so my greatest pains trials tribulations losses heartbreaks I can't even remember anymore and imagine that I'm the bigger scale of existence this is our life. Yes it seems so important
 I got a question from a shooter who's listening to the show you just from England he says many people come back from war with trauma PTSD from witnessing horrible things how did Parts Authority for fine Krishna Consciousness help him process and deal
 well I mean what I got out of the army
I went straight to India and my spiritual Master cuz I found a new teacher he told me to go to South Africa and it just start integrating in and educate you no share Krishna with others but you can't outrun your mental issues like you can't outrun it so you know what that point I was sleeping 45 minutes at night while I was eating just a handful of food a day because I just lost all appetite I couldn't sleep because of nightmares
 I'm just still I tried to push on and push on and push on and and then it became really rough like the suicide attempts started you know all these different
 one person grabbed me and said you need help
 that everything started to fall into place and you know Krishna Consciousness is one thing right like I remember once somebody
he said how are you doing partner and I said well you know I'm struggling with this and they said well you know what you just chanted Charlie then you know your PTSD would go away right away and I was like yeah like that's like a song that's like a bull shit like thing to say to somebody like no it's a very complex trauma is very complex but Krishna Consciousness needs to be there but also psychological help needs to be there sure like step step by step so that's how I I dealt with it was I had to experience the worst of it before I decided through intervention of others to get help and then it wasn't just as simple as
 I just getting help it was like going to treatment like 4 days a week and and doing Simple service is actually my favorite I'm being a devotee back because I I no longer with a traveling like me
all I did was going and clean the temples trash cans and dishes well I didn't have to get the ladder simple service it's amazing on on healing myself mentally
 and also trying to keep my spiritual life above water
 you know I am speaking to Geva G from the body recovery group is a big leader within with that people are going through 12 step issues but tying Krishna into it a recovery issues and she says the same thing it's the simple service that we need them really struggling what can I do simply today I think a lot of times are our thing and boxy is let's just do it a little simply like right now
 the stupidest worshiping is deity you can see him over in the lap they're just he's just doing simple as that simple syrup that service that just ground person before we start the show I was
my Pooja Lori and Brian and Mara was just reading reading prayers as we were doing it's that simple stuff and even some such as simple as a gardening or just one is especially when it's not about you I'm going to give this to the Lord to the Earth to other people we have Savory treats at the farm and people say these are the best Retreats ever we've been to the other Treats but just doing saying where there's no I'm not expecting something in return I just want to give you know it's it's such a beautiful healing for the soul
 and yep and I'm sure it doesn't end with what you went through I'm sure it doesn't end and I'm sure you got to go back to basics on a regular basis
 well I I think
 for me
 I am taking a different route then say some people for me it's not just the spiritual aspect is not just doing the treatment which I still do treatment
talk to a psychologist on it let you know twice a month but I still have to go through all these things but then there's actually the physical aspect also right like probably says you know like what is it helped by John Cena spiritual practices and then we can actually share what we have right without having these 3 Days To problems we can't actually understand what to share anything to people we need to have our mental health and physical health together and then we have to have a spiritual practice to be able to speak realization that will actually be meaningful not just parroting what we read or what we hear someone else say answer that's where the other aspect came in was like starting to do the Endurance Sports Runner or biker I do I do a little bit of both like I do I used to do more cycling but now I do ultra marathons like specially the Hundred Mile and then like 100 km
because I just feel like I just feel that it's got any music by I don't run with anybody I run a loan always and that is like that is like therapy or just with your mind and and people don't get enough down time with their mind anymore the mind's always it's like okay I have to walk around for a little bit I'm going to just listen to podcast the entire time just as I wonder what that does to us that we always are taking any information we must be missing on missing out on just self-reflection that comes with the old days of using a push mower and just or just walking to your car are going for a walk to your friend's house you want to share a little bit about therapy behind
 first of all Kudos 300 miles
300 km I don't get my head around that you know as soon as I like walk up the road
 well I think I you know I think it's quite serious like everything else you know Krishna conscious wise health and sports athletic wise I take it quite seriously I train I trained like 19 20 hours a week running you know like I run like a hundred miles a week 125 my want to be present because it's very easy to say like I'm a bad person it's maybe you do you go to any spiritual group and they're like
 do I call Ayo yeah I'm I'm so full in I'm so this I'm so glad I have such an eagle but you know there's a stage and bought the ice cold in north in the Ricky which is like the deepest darkest crap in your heart it's not it's so deep it so below the surface surface
lifetime's of
 of all the healthy behaviors that affects our spiritual life
 and just being alone with that with with accepting those parts of my heart when waiting through all of that and in hopes that I emerge from it with a better understanding of what we're I am what I need to change and what I need to work on and like next week I'm starting on a project it's 72 hours of straight running on like a 300 miles from one side of the country that has new hours when you sleep you sleep while you're running for 72 hours I'll stay awake and yellow under extreme person
on my hands and if you look at it if you look like
 cashew Pooh learning about your immortality right now I understand why this is going you want some Mystic powers out of this group of books that austerity in the wrong Consciousness can create a heart that is made of Stone I Put A Heart soft like butter
 okay man I got to get my act together for three days non-stop can you make sure I at least walk to get the mail today. Make sure you get your 10,000 steps today. Still something
has he gets help you check your step count it's got to be ridiculous I'm almost 50 everything now is with is trying to be with Consciousness now I hate my life is almost 50 I have no excuse Mara you just let us begin meatballs I'm just getting plumper and plumper he's running barefoot in hot sand for 3 Days showering in the rain only

 we have to do things with Consciousness behind it it's everything is with Consciousness like my relationship with my partner is because I decided I've never had a healthy relationship in my life
my parents were in a healthy relationship I was abused you know like I've never had like a healthy romantic relationship it's always been like very toxic and very unhealthy so I figured at one point if I don't ever experienced a healthy romantic relationship how can I have a healthy relationship with Christian but never experienced that and it's just a relationship of toxic toxic relationship based on fear based on guilt based on all these all these issues that I have a whole point of my ranting I guess is as we get older at one point we have to actually become conscious of the of the activities we're doing and connect them in some way to Krishna because otherwise it just stays
 a theoretical process that and we the advancement is very minimal love that I love that make sense
it makes total sense it makes total sense
 wow what's your next running thing we run out of time here but I'm just curious why what's your next adventure is where I am and I start running the pewter pot so it's a transverse it's a Traverse of the country of the Netherlands from north to south and the idea is because it's machine games appearance weekend so the idea is to just do austerity and in the eye or any idea on within the heart out of the material suffering and understanding who I am better in every aspect as a partner as a father as a bike show and as a person so nice that alone you got a team of other devotees with you other brothers
I have a very good life nutrition nutrition plan again I take everything very seriously so I have like a cold shower okay plan you know I'll have some like vegan Burgers somewhere in there just to have some real food and there's one person that's helping me and probably meet them every 30 miles
