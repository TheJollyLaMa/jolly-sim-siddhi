 with the blessings of her family and her teacher's she has had the amazing Fortune to travel the world singing writing and witnessing those hard Transformations that she
so much first-hand she can honestly say that conducting workshops classes and seminars seminars like your tongue has absolutely changed her life for the better and she can't think of a better way to live now along with her family she's focused her efforts on the New York City community and pouring her heart into the beautiful practices of kirtan writing an incredibly transform a tradition about Tioga welcome at 2 to go pee
 thank you I was reading her by she sent me last minute a bio though was written in first-person and they said you just kind of change like I to her but actually know it was more complicated than it really well do you know this time you're right now you're in Austria kind of a secret get together maybe I could get one of those little sick of their last year
some friends of ours get together on a beautiful Alpine Lake there and I'm missing you guys
 but you're just so I'm sure you're having the time of your life over there a perfect place to do a podcast from what we had last year we did your brother not to govind at this time and I think that became like on on YouTube eek-a-mouse most popular ever episode and we're really competitive so I'm really hoping to get this but you know I remember last year I spent about a week there that it is generally we get together for about 2 weeks there and I spent one week there and then I left moved on and I put that there's there's no schedule there everybody just kind of mingles and has free time that you usually don't get that right usually is
play something scheduled father yeah there's a huge either. You know there's a town festival or Workshop schedule and then we're in a place for 34 days and then we're heading back to the US at crazy hours and it is definitely a mind shift cuz she is like to get to know each other talk like in a different Zone but the only thing that's like a daily schedule is that in the evenings or secure towns and there's a lot of really wonderful kirtan lyrics and I remember I remember it very what's the word when you remember something very clear like it's with me still is the last night before you don't have to leave early the next morning in the last night I attended the Cure town and it was a it was first Marvel a beautiful beautiful kirtan and then but Hari took it next and it was kind of you and him going back and forth especially
 and Barcelona was there playing her violin
she's she's she's a devoted disciple Radha soami in one of the were not exaggerating when I say she's one of the world's top violinist she's the The Soloist for the I believe it's the Vienna Philharmonic and credible centuries-old violins that she just you know of all and your time off I never heard the melody before and it was just something about I arrive before long I said I got a record this so I got a good large 45-minute chunk of it and I still listen to that now but it's it's a really want to do that let me say for those 10 haven't heard of it you to go pee she's more than any she's a writer
 but more than anything she's known for a time and she was kind of raised in a town Diner
I don't think you actually have any recordings of your own like like like released official albums or anything like that all these years of my own but still sounds like a different world still despite that it's it's it's still has that kind of DIY underground kind of thing we're like you're known like globally as like or is it is a really wonderful and important kirtan later so over 40 million views and 40 million are you doing kirtan
 yeah forty million I think I said that's like you top The Beatles practically like in one video clip or something like that but let's let's start just by talking a little bit better you know how you dropped into this world of kirtan and intermittent in bhakti you know
how you grow up
 yeah so I booked it been integral to the whole reason that I am here I was born two months premature you know the supposed to be I didn't know that I always thought she was too small for the family I definitely think that you know what I probably didn't know that but it just thought of it in a long time and I was only a pound and a half really so small that was a lb and 12 oz when I was born and then dropped weight went down to a pound and a half and I was a baby dangerous circumstances it was a relief from here to here and it's Palm amazing
 so that was it that that big something sweet about that but that's her
my my parents were praying the entire time and my dad would come every evening because I was in an incubator for several months at least two and a half something like that and I was in the incubator that whole time in my father would come and he would sing for me but my mom would come and she was so stressed out about the situation that all she could do was sit and reach you and bother with life and we should say that your parents were initiated devotees really important devotees in the in the New York Community and the the the Temple of the Radha Govinda temple in Brooklyn
 yeah they joined in 1974 and 85 were born into an earring that incubator and they're coming and doing keertana reading Bob with time
is actually the perfect time to ask me about the one on May 7th and funny enough it at two months premature I should have been here right around now birthday when I was supposed to come out but I was I was too eager okay so my mom would my father would sing and here I am so rare was completely and absolutely utterly integral to everything that literally the reason why I'm here and your family has great musicians and you know you're kind of Born Into the kirtan tradition of the Radha Govinda Temple which is a powerful kirtan tradition year
kind of compartmentalize it was really like the program is going on over here and yeah I guess you all can do kirtan
 over here and then mostly after the program was going on was it like that your whole life or did that kind of develop after some time I know it was like that for a lot of my life how I started singing We would be in a temple room and it was just myself ananta Johnny Cage was in on his wife sometimes our church on Google share contact but usually about four of us I remember those days and would be after the program and we'll go late tonight or something like that or later it's like when we were able to sing you sing whenever we could get fit into thing yeah sometimes when people ask me the question you know
how did you tear down but I feel like there's no time and the temple schedule for me and like welcome to of my existence thing whenever because krishna's there every day you know your brother really played a role and continues to play a role is kind of like a or b the right word like a general he's got that military discipline as back to him for sure but but he's also very encouraging at the say almost like ordering you to participate in an encouraging and strong way I was ordered to hang out in the hallways and then he would literally grabbed me by the arm what are you doing stop chilling with your girls over here and get in the kids.
 Exact verbatim words and then he would drag me to get on but I think without that
I wouldn't I wouldn't have the strong connection that I have with Kurt on today because actually he was right most of the people that I was trying to spend time with her talk to you then I don't even talk to you anymore and I went through a really incredibly rough time growing up I didn't actually have friends until High School
 I see your your life is kind of like devotional e isolated or something from Jamaica Queens from from New York City and weirdo cuz that would be such a vegetarian Weirdo And I was black in a public school that was in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood what school did you go to PS 107
what's the weather in Queensbury area in this like it just happened to be public school but is predominantly Jewish demographic and so we were singing Hanukkah songs weird at least it was so sure you'd think that we would find some common ground on that we totally different because you're so like
 my parents would send us on a cottage cheese with that go wrong with potatoes and all the kids are like what is that like a potato no yeah I mean I said Not only was I a weirdo vegetarian strange religious kid but then I was black
 theme song
okay there were only two black kids in the whole school me and one other girl named Mousie and she is powerful magic so there was no one to relate to you and you had to go into your own heart hahaha I live in your mind or something and her name is Maureen and this whole let you know how much of an impact it makes when your kid cuz now I'm 39 and not 6 anymore and we have been friends and then one day she comes to me and she's like oh my mom said I can't play with you anymore because your skin color is going to rub off on me and we think that's really ugly and she spoke to me again never play the termination does this other six year old have you don't listen to anything else but that one and that's where we stand
call Krishna so yeah I didn't really have a lot of friends until I was in high school and then I went to a high school for Performing Arts and then we were all weirdos just came through that school was cancelled at school I believe really yes I think I did an interview with drifty baby. See that the artist and she was telling me that you know there's like a little crew there people that went on to become devotees so mean while you're growing up in this family the deeply devotional family you're in the temple is maybe not a second home maybe it's like it almost like your first home it is home I would do homework there I would talk to the devotees there and I remembered any of the devotees that would ever like give me the time of day and have a conversation those are devotees that you always remember like all the peoples like
the people that make such an impression on you and your growing up and when the whole outside world is doing whatever it does there's usually hopefully a home with with devotees right was there was there a point in your life where you your I know the people that grew up in strong religious communities that for a lot of them there's a point where it has to shift from what you've been brought up in and what you're being told to do
 to what you actually decide for yourself that this is this is my this is where my heart is this is this is my 5th decision and so I think everybody has to come to Krishna Consciousness at some point you could be born into a but like you said at a certain point you have to make that decision make it your own and then carve out now what the spiritual path
for you right I even from the time I was eight I always wanted to be a devotee just because all of the stories I'm a big reader a Storyteller as well as movement is filled with stories the most fantastic Stories the most mystical stories easy for me to okay if I can't find any friends out there I have a whole world inside where nobody can touch me
 I was always going to say I was going to suggest that I thought when you say you know you kind of develop your own path I was going to say for you I was I was going to say it must have been a combination of kirtan and Radha Govinda and the DD in the temple but actually I wasn't thinking about that yet now that you're saying that this makes so much sense to me that he was also Bob and Tom and and and pop Barton the stories
growing up these were the books that I would ever choose to to read so we had remembered to the comic books and all that too or did you just go right mess that you were there when I was about nine and third grade we had this drop everything and read so if you had done all the school work that you needed to do they would give you free time to be able to read and for me at like this like gold you just want to give me time to do what I like doing and they said you could bring any books that you wanted and the books that I chose to bring was there was this really simply written book The Life and pastimes of ramanuja charya okay probably seen that book yes I think I have a copy of that and it's really easy to understand and that was the book that I chose to bring which also might be widened have friends because
else is like reading Nancy Drew And I'm like but South Indian since you can't pronounce roasted every day just because of stuff like that but somehow or other it didn't make me want to move farther away from Krishna Consciousness I think I already knew that it just like there's no going back I can't really be normal but I did wind up as I got older having those questions of like what if none of us have it quite right what if Christians don't have it quite right what if Muslims don't have it quite right just don't have it like what if there's all like smidgen of Truth nobody has it like white rice like what I think about all of all of this all true and then again
my mom's mom was passing away and she was passing from throat cancer and a host of other things and my mom was there and she would go visit her mom and her mom was not favorable toward the devotees at all she couldn't really speak so much because the vocal patterns that one day she starts just kind of freaking out and my mom isn't what's wrong what's wrong and she says they're pulling me
 remember holding you who is there's no one here what are you talkin about pulling you who's pulling you and my grandmother trying to frantically looking around and one of my mom's sister get just colored her hair this like red Auburn copper color copper color and my grandmother points and goes hair like that cuz her hair was short
I got like this copper color and my mom goes oh my God the wrong people are here let's fill people in on so this what what what a treat to go with speaking tours is in the bar with Tom there's a story of a person image I'm yelling at 6 cancelled describing his death he hadn't lived a deeply spiritual life or it might say he abandoned his his spiritual practices and he's on his deathbed and he sees these terrifying
 ogres are creatures are men but terrifying men with that colored hair and twisted faces are coming to pull him out of his body pull his soul from his body and drag him to the nether regions for punishment and I'll tell you something we interviewed garnish a boo wants he was actually one of our very first interviews
chaplain and he told me and he worked in New York Presbyterian hospital and he said that he would hear stories of people talking about these creatures
 and not only that but that all of the other Hospital chaplain from all the other religious Traditions all had heard these stories all know about these yeah, my mom was thinking oh no the wrong people are here it should be the Vishnu just not the young man who went to her neck as as give me those and I'm telling you this woman was not at all favorable towards devotees give me those she knew I'd like on the phone with my mom after all this is happening but what did you do to people I took them off and give it like you took them off for you but then then
they went away and the next day my mom came with like Sanctified gunga water and prayers to learn affirmative and she was chanting and basically asked her that I don't think I ever questioned it again because that was a faith Builder all the worst things
 then all the best thing you'll have to be true that's a little bit better then I can probably imagine
 very interested that blue at what age was that again Seventeen or so
 so did your at that point it was a natural that you're you're going into kirtan was a deeper experience going into prayer became a deeper thing or gradually but also so right directly after that not too long after that his Holiness Buck teacher tomorrow at
 began leaving his body
and that was huge for me that was about two thousand five or six or something like that years ago 2002
 yeah 2002 I'm I'm 17 so then 2003-2004 2005 then when things start going downward and I'm about to church tomorrow actually was very important spiritual leader in your own family he was definitely like an uncle always always encouraging me and cared on and I didn't even know how he knew that
 because he would know that I played Miranda and he would send me into the middle of a group of whomever the job to get over the stage fright at some point and my my kind of my thing has been that yes I am afraid usually terrify
still even before cheer dones I will get nervous
 there's a feeling that happens somewhere in the middle when Krishna takes over and
 if you say yes to the service anyway in Buck you tomorrow just famous quote because when you when you don't feel
 the capability to do something a service but you say yes in the mood for forming that service that's when empowerment happens that's the formula right there
 and that's what I feel like with kirtan we won't always feel capable we won't always feel like we should be there or somebody might have a better voice or somebody might be more recognizable when we give ourselves just the opportunity to say yes to the service and then go on with a heart full of Faith empowerment magic just happens
 I will take that to heart meditate on that
no it went to hear you say that lends a lot of way to it because we see the power that comes to your time that this little one pound you know it starts to I always thought of you like I said I had forgotten that that that that important detail about your life but but I always thought of you as a small person with a lot of power maybe we can kind of come up more till like the present now and just speak about in your own life and like where your inspiration lies it and how maybe like how you did the practices of kirtan Joppa prayer how they intersect in your devotional practice and what they mean to you at this stage in your life
 yeah I know
do you like other now your whole your whole different world today
 I look at this kid and and she's 13 and doing her own thing and being like
 emo some days you just eccentric artist other days and diving into anime some days and
 the other day I was like
 who's going to come pick up his kid I've been babysitting for the last night and then I realized I'm still responsible if it's been completely completely different and funny enough for a long time I never thought I wanted a girl because the world is mean to girls and I are vulnerable right I thought I have been through some stuff
I don't know if I want to because your York or instinct is like will let me shield and protect them from every little thing that could happen and that is impossible
 and so I don't know that anything has quite built my face like motherhood number one even even like having a child you can take all like the breathing classes that you want but nobody can like nobody can really prepare you for the idea of pushing a watermelon size human yeah that must be terrifying and why didn't anybody like consult me before they they said like oh yeah this is what your body is built for what they did
I do remember even like pushing feeling like women have died in childbirth and that's like you know a common side effect that couldn't happen and then at some point I thought OK Google let's you and me if this is going to happen it's going to happen however you want it to happen
 and throughout over and above all of my fears my trepidation might like holding back whatever the case is it was incredibly faith building situation ever because of childbirth itself or motherhood in general
 looking down this tunnel and then you have to really figure out who is with me and Krishna is always with us I I know that for certain and after those
I really felt like no I absolutely know this for certain decimate you know there's something about
 being alone
 that
 if you don't experience it in in one way or another
 you your you would likely never really turned to God as deeply as you would it it kind of remains on a superficial level but I've been my my wife has been taken care of her mother for like the past year and so I've been like living a lot of that time I've been living like when I'm in I spent five months in my 4 so I was living with friends but when I'm back in New York like I'm alone like almost you know all the time you know and it's it's it's definitely when you want to when you experience when you embrace it in the context the body and the context of prayer and community
we got in your own heart you see how facilitates of what to speak of like the kind of aloneness when is that that kind of alone it's what you just shared with me sounds like OK child birth and death these are the street even if there's other people around you are it's you and God then that's it and and and that's it and that's such a young boy there must be nothing that prepares you for death like childbirth and my brother unfortunately got ran over by a car few years ago that was the most heartbreaking they survived it but it was an incredibly scary and dragged underneath the car
 I talked about it now and like yeah sounds like childbirth
because at that point you don't know what else you have like a Thrust into a situation where literally everything else is taken from you and all you have is your ability and your decision do I Surrender or not
 and sometimes the surrender is just a giving over of okay I don't have to handle this all on my own surrender doesn't necessarily have to mean like oh well you know I shouldn't try to do things for myself course you should but it's just the giving over of the idea and the mindset of I am the controller everything that happened to the product of my own capabilities
 accepting the truth that they're all along but that even if we accepted theoretically we don't fully feel it
 for sure
 it's feeling these things you know we read these books there's so many valuable instructions
we take the men we have facing them we reflect on them
 but at a certain point we had to feel them
 deeply
 and I think that's the real the birth of the the real connection that one has with God you know is not theoretical but it's as real or even more real than anything else that we experience and not even built on any of the identities that we claim to know it's like my relationship with Christian is not based on any of these identities that we think make us who we are within Society so yes I'm a mom but also
 I'm Christmas friend and then D who's my child
 I always comes
point in a in a like any society and Community where you have that thing about yourself or it's like wait but what if they all knew this about me would they all really still be here in this community supporting me and I guarantee you you Christian would be there supporting you but I don't want no matter what it is
 it's such a powerful principle that did this idea what you're sharing now like there's as childbirth but there's also this like you're saying like now there's this individual with their own proclivities and ideas and desires and interest that I have before I was directing the entire thing and other kind of just like taking off on their own that feelings got to also be like Oh I'm just alone with you again Krishna experience of I'm speculating so you can tell me if what I'm saying is is true but this site
yeah
 that we feel we need this direct connections with other living beings for life to be meaningful and secure and satisfying but when we get it that actually we both this individual and I
 have a more real connection with the root of all existence
 and and when we both understand that we understand each other better than we ever had and actually connect better than we ever have will not head to but I wound up going through a whole separation and divorce and you start thinking well
 what kind of devotee does that make me a my still the same good Christian a kid that I've been this entire time what does the title changing mean anything and so you know a lot of people ask me
it felt like how how is it with you and Andy's father and like actually better than it's ever been because what I wound up finding was towards the end of that we are not even treating each other like vaishnav sword anymore and it's like this is I can't I can't raise a child just for the sake of simply saying oh look your parents stayed together but they weren't even treating each other or you like a bison of like I can't do that I refused and so then I had to do the brave thing and say okay I'm not going to do this anymore
 I'm not going to live by the title in the rules that everybody says this is what makes a good devotee in theory and then and now
 with Krishna at the root of all things you work so much better as friends and as co-parents we we are able to do so much better and then treat each other with such a bigger level of risk
act like I feel like there's been so much healing that is come from saying just like I think the Romantic part is not for us we don't have to desperately try to keep that going to not need therapy from being our kid which is what I've always said I want to raise my child and not need therapy from being my child they made it there because I mean else but not from being like that and I try like that's that's my goal and so good the bitterness that everything else it was so much easier to forgive and put down
 I don't have to carry that anymore because we don't have to interact like that anymore and I found like our communication. Better everything got better so much got better then some well-intentioned people he likes it in that does that mean that you should get
get back together that's to work but yeah like you said with with Krishna of the route and having this spiritual identity as the source of all the things that we're doing in life I find that it helps us to really connect better with one another because it draws our attention to the empty things that we say to one another then sometimes you know somebody said something to me the other day and I can't remember what it was and I really do you really think that is that what you really feel today and I said no kind of like a devotee thing I just say we might not need to say those things you did this is this is always where the spiritually were the great the great Saints The Great Divide
through their life through the instructions account always trying to nudge us or push us are encouraged us to always be progressing in the in the death of yttrium in the depth of understanding and but it does seem like life has to kind of like um Krishna has to kind of working his way to put us in some kind of circumstances that the kind of pull us into that more contemporary World unless you have become sufficiently frustrated with this material world you never have that Arjuna moment we're so Govinda finds this way is to frustrate you
 so we got 10 minutes or so left at you that maybe let's just talk about maybe you can share with us just some thoughts just some encouragement or some instructions or some ideas about how we might approach our own
Santana our own spiritual practices realizations of your own that might that might Inspire us think the most Brave thing that anyone could ever do it's not a bypassing reality and
 some people see that way some people could see it that way and there are some people that it does read that in the beginning but whatever spirituality you're in if you stick with it long enough you get past the the everything is just so beautiful and I'm so happy face real quick and then it starts to like turn off all those Shadows that matter lurking and hiding and so I think it is one of the most Brave things that we could ever do because this entire world wants us to do something different every moment everywhere we go somebody's pulling out us to do something different
no don't put your focus over there put it over here and I think it's incredibly Brave to say no I I need a minute I need to go really internal and contemplate this and really think about this with the Lord in the heart that it gets even more brave because people are like a whore you to be able to like talk to God in your heart like that sounds crazy and also the people in charge didn't give you permission and they didn't need to because the secret is that God is always residing there always has been that's not a new thing it's not anything that anybody needed to give you permission to do I feel like it is incredibly courageous every day that you choose to remain spiritual in a material functioning world
 and everybody for that when you sit down to leave kirtan or to chance
is there any do you have any kind I mean sometimes he says I personally knew you don't want to miss so just blast them out to the world but is there anything you could share with us to encourage us in our in those practices it whether it's a practical something practical to consider to do or to think or contemplate or some aphorism or something like that I've thought of Joppa prayer the whole deal as a conversation and and when I say conversation I literally mean the most real conversation that you can have if you're chanting japa have a conversation with God as your best friend because I have a conversation and I promise you got it at all because you never have to tell anybody else about that it's just in between you and God if your person that curses like a sailor in your everyday life
 I mean sometimes you just got to check on the kids
you got to be who you are all I'm saying is going to be like trust me. Been there done there heard it like I do everything and there are times when people people look at me strange when I say that I like but I like to read Krishna book and Krishna book it tells us that Krishna and all his friends as little boys would go to the caves and they would yell foul language into the cave to keep the rest of it I don't like these boys is in the cursing and Cave just to hear an echo back I like I know boys will be so Krishna is not boys are at the Pinnacle of spiritual by your personality if you're chanting japa and these things are running through your mind really offer them and just be as much of yourself as possible and then
give yourself the opportunity to receive reciprocation how many yeah right how do you spell lately might my practice has been on finding gratitude and there've been so many like I'll find myself in a day that's been really stressful or something then I'll sit down then I'll Chan and think
 but no matter what else happened in this day this moment is perfect if there was never any tomorrow or any moment more than this this moment has been perfect and it is as simple as like I switch my brain and going thank you thank you for like one perfect moment this world is crazy and insane and always on fire
 somehow or other I've been gifted one perfect moment
 and as long as I'm chanting I can make that perfect moment last and so I find myself
you know sometimes I might go know I have to go do something but I like but I don't want to stop my perfect moment see it always has been such a perfect moment and so I kind of feel that way even about this podcast like I feel like time didn't have to exist for like a half it's just been I'm super grateful to be here it's been a really perfect moment with the two to go pee hey you know I was I was just yesterday
 I was alone here you know in New York City other people are out on Retreats other people that are in Austria other people in different places I was I was in the park and I have this I have different special places in the park that I go to
 this one really cool place I'm I'm I'm I'm hesitant to say exactly where because I don't want it to become too popular there's a beautiful
Shady's little what's the word I'm looking for Grove OR
 what's the Sanskrit word I'm looking for
 pleasure grow if you know I like a little little yeah there's a little that I go to sometimes and I was thinking just yesterday I went there and I spent time writing and I spend time chatting
 and I thought to myself that in the past like myself even not so long ago
 I would feel like when it's a beautiful day in New York City it's got to be something happened and I got to be with other people and I got it feel like I'm part of some kind of party or something you know and if I was alone on a day like that I feel like all I'm missing right in the heart there be feeling like I'm missing out I'm not part of some kind of movie scene that I meant to be a part of right now that makes life worth living and and I feeling empty
source of some sense of emptiness and I'm sitting here feeling like you know and I think aging helps with it and obviously practicing contemplation of the best be like I can just be here with God in my heart and in his nature and it within the chanting his name and the really doesn't have this is a perfect moment right this itself is a perfect moment yeah it's there doesn't need to be anything else if if we can allow it and that gratitude and finding those perfect moment because we all have them every single one of us we have them and they might not last as long as we want you know as long as we hoped but the more gratitude we start finding for those perfect moment no more will start finding that we have recognized our brain gets rewired to recognize that this is important and we start seeing them all over the place so I am so sure where we're going to find that perfect moment
 well you know
I remember when Andrew passed away important person in your life a great career. Charya grade teachers cure time and when he passed away I wrote something I think I read it in your presence before you know him a bit of a eulogy I suppose my appreciation of him and I and I and that experience that you talked about I always felt so profound that maybe I began to think a little bit like you're thinking now due to his power when you're sitting in the in the the in the Krishna balaram Temple and burned oven in the courtyard and Temple in just a few feet off to the side hearing and Radha shyam Sunder and kick the ball around or right here on this side of you and through the beautiful Courtyards through the branches of the of the tomal tree you're seeing Sheila Potts samadhi tomb there
 and you would and then he's leaving this kirtan that's just like I'm taking you to
you would feel this is a perfect moment there's no other place in the world if I could be anywhere else in the world right now I would not choose it I would choose this right here and we can feel that at any moment a person that's actually getting Spirit experience can feel that at any moment anywhere
