 I've seen educated about the Seneca stupid ass who's not here today but he's traveling there but he's live on zoom and he is in his taxi cab on the Van Wyck Expressway heading back to New York but we have a great feeling to alga Rhonda who was here yesterday and I think everybody loves you boil and that's why we invited you back today or two of Joy walk around go back and show everybody Welcome to all y'all thank you figure out. Thanks for having me here
it it was a fun show yesterday actually lots of fun and you know why we got you here or just going to talk a little bit about more of your course if you have that way he can put on the board but basically
 a platform Bonnie is a platform you know everybody wants a platform nowadays we're even making our wisdom of the ages platform and then we're going to work intermittently with with Vonnie but you know they're these platforms for people get
 absorbed in Netflix or whatever Spotify or any Hulu Hulu Plus Max and your watching their shows and they're all taking us in different directions and I'm know you know I'm not so much into platforms like this but when I do scroll around Netflix what I find is a lot of things on murder murders big murders huge
I usually just searched out, knees and sometimes the comedies are grotesque like they're like they're comedies of jokes I don't want in my Consciousness and so I love this idea of spiritual platforms where you can drive down the road and you can listen to things that are sort of going to Enlighten you do to make you laugh their light-hearted their teeth their philosophical it's what we put in our Consciousness on our downtime
 that make us who we are and so you have a new course going over the body of a give you want to share a few moments about it yeah things are going to get back there I will and we were at one point we talked about murder and grotesque comedies and I was bringing back home but no you're totally right and I appreciate that point that there's so much information coming out of sperm everywhere and reserve a spot for me just to give us an opportunity to have something wholesome educate
uplifting and a gaited horses having a lake sound about it's great for new people who don't have a lot of experience from the bug of agita I want to get introduction and it's also really great Four Season readers or people who have studied the bug of agita for a while and want some extra inside of how the whole thing fits together we talked about the structure we talked about the flow we pull out all the things that we kind of know are in the Gita but we don't exactly know where in the Gita it is so we go through all of those things together so it'll help you if you're a teacher it will help you learn how to share the bug of agita with others in a way that is authentic authoritative in the sense that you're able to reference the Gita directly have a greater understanding of grass with the flow and structure so really excited about it and you can catch the link a tear in the chat board mirror awesome are also puts it in the podcast notes so just check your notes in the podcast into space
link that was in the sages has but now you get a special discount and and of course launched on April 1st and if you sign up for the membership and course by then you can sign up for special 4 weeks of live sessions with me that I'll be hosting for the first cohort of people taking the course you can have weekly questions and answers and extra insights into the slot that that comes along with it if we work book and get a copy the bug of agita all sorts of great stuff so it's not outright In This Moment is that April 1st yeah you can join Vonnie today anytime but the course gets lodged April 1st so put on your calendar and then you're in your head on the platform and then on April 1st I'm going to reason and I was going to listen to it on the ride to the airplane to fill up my mind was something high and then try to download it and listen to it on the plane but what I'll do is I'll listen to your other course which is
also on Bonnie and then when it comes out April 1st I'll listen to it here's the link it's b b i t. L y b l e b b i t l y / Vani Gita youbi ini Kita Gita so that's great and I think it is important and what you mentioned how it's not just like we want to be the theologians were just quoting verses from the Gita but how to practically apply this stuff and talk to our students about it for yoga teachers or we're just telling people about the Gita what is his book about and how to put it in relevant terms in yourself and you know we practice this stuff on a regular basis how to make this stuff accessible to the modern world because it can be really thick studying the Gated really Hattie I know that first verse of the bug of agita dharmakshetra kurukshetra you know what's the English translation of the first one
celebrities were assembled in the battlefield the roster said
 oh Sanjaya you know what did my at the place of pilgrimage could have shut your what is my son's of the sons of pain do what do they do when they say they do I got to treat arrastra said and then I was like a close the book I'm not reading this again it was just like sunshine. Rita roster kurukshetra I've had enough attention span is yeah and we break all of that down in the chorus and it's the first chapters usually chat with you kind of skipped over cuz there's tons of names there's not as many quote on quote philosophical lessons but it actually is super super rich at the end the end I was working a lot with kaysha Swami for those medications from he's an amazing teacher and he was giving a lot of added inside and helping me kind of structure the course and figure out how to present it in a way that really make sense and so all of those things the context of the key to the Mahabharat
characters in the underlying meanings behind some of the things that may seem overwhelming or not make sense we Lumen and all of that so you've never read the Mahabharata you have no idea of any culture you're not Indian you didn't grow up reading any of the stuff that whole first chapter you can get so lost in names yeah it could be for a person who does not like a determined reader I'm a little weak mind at all I'll say that I'm man enough to tell you how weak my did I am and cannot concentrate very well but it it just threw me off course and then I got a taste for the Gita by someone really walking me through it verse by verse chapter by chapter and then I fell in love with it and then went to speak of you read that Mahabharat then you're really in love with the first chapter yet I'm going to look forward to it because it never gets old it never gets this stuff never gets old you can read the data again and again and again you can make it a practice
everyday we just Channel chapter of the Gita in Sanskrit in English and it's always fresh it's ever fresh and that's that beauty about these Vedic teachings when you feel a little dark you feel a little damp you feel a little moldy
 open the gate of chance of chapter and especially if you've been taught it by person has been studying it it's always fresh and it just sort of it just makes any a paled into a sunny day that's how I feel ya what sauce it's always fresh but it's also relevant every season chapter day of Our Lives so what when when you're a young couple when your season married couple when you have kids when you're in empty nester when your divorce when you got an illness when you're rich when you're climbing the corporate ladder when you're on top of the corporate ladder when you're falling off the corporate ladder like that whatever cease-fire for the corporate ladder when you weren't able to get rich telling other people how to tell other people how to get rich
the only other people that you don't have to be rich to tell people how to get rich okay then started a show like some of that's going to get into every show her but what I'm saying is that it's it's getting a rather get a 10 years ago five years ago a year ago and you think I know that but actually it has a whole new level of Me based on where you're at today different than where you were a year ago or a week ago
 okay okay so I'm never going to ask someone else right now Miss Mara please enlighten us

 reading from the srimad bhagavatam
 Canta 7 chapter 6 text 11 through 13
 we're in this we're in the steep
 yeah it's a big one it's a big one and under stand like
 this part of the Bible times really laying down the absolute truth and it's cutting
through the mode of goodness and sometimes goodness
 can be a compromise and can cheat you out of greatness
 we do that yeah I will the word Sado means one definition of what side of means to cut cut away our material aleutians and sometimes it can be sometimes we need that soon as it's like it's almost like the vagos I was like one big material intervention for all of us like we're in some sort of Illusion some material addiction and nobody wants to hear you walk into a room of an intervention I've never been apart of the intervention of other side but yet we know what one is and you walk in it and you think everyone's against you you think I want to wait tonight maybe people don't know what intervention is culture yeah when you have Lane intervention but they themselves so all the people that love them
 get together the family members people
why in and they said hey you want to meet me for lunch or something they sure do it and they don't know what's going on you think they're meeting one person for lunch and they get to the place and everybody that loves them has flown in from all over the world perhaps and they're just saying we love you we actually care about you you're ruining your life you can't see it but we all see it and we we sacrificed our time and our resources to come here to tell you how much we care about you
 that's an intervention and usually intervention is when things have gotten so bad like a person's life is just it's ruining their life and lies people around them that they just it's almost a disservice for us to not do something like this because it's gotten so bad for this person right and that person their first thought is it oh thank you so much I'm so glad you did this is like everyone is against me everyone is trying to hurt me nobody loves nobody understands me and it kind of takes a minute if it goes
Cecily where they get on board and so far we have a sort of there pointing out unsavory truths are aspects about life and not all of them may apply to us in one sense you know we may not have the exact so as we talked yesterday don't have kids or attached with the kids in the same way or whatever feeling ownership of our kids the same way but the principal a little bit about being caught up in the sense of I me and mine in the material world does apply to all of us have a story
 Natalie name any names but this was a person is a really nice devotee in my life who had a friends
 with a friend and I might be getting sort of wrong but it's the point is the person her friend was not a devotee she was a devoted but her friend was not of the body she was a good friend and she was dying of cancer she had cancer and she had these heavy heavy pain medication
 and this girl
straight edge shouldn't drink or smoke, but her friend wasn't really who is dying and all of her friends
 my boyfriend cetera we're stealing her pain medication and they were addicted to her pain relievers and they were like using her
 it is just like a degrading way and finally this friend of ours is nice to votee she finally had a breakdown she said listen these people don't love you they don't care about you you are dying you might not believe in what I believe in but you you believe in me and I'm going to ask you I'm going to be here for you till the moment you leave your body come with me I'll take you away from all of these people give up everything and I'm going to help you leave your body and bring the oven and she took this person to bring the oven and this person had a complete transformation of her. She ended up getting an issue
Red Robin on her deathbed amazing story but it was one of those interventions work you do things are good this guy likes me I use a little bit of my drugs and and you see it coming out now that was a pretty intense story but a lot of times in the Bog what time you hear stories like Maharaj Bart who's ready to leave his body is giving up everything and then Barnes this little deer and the deer eat takes care of your pets and we're almost warm heart it's like a warm-hearted Disney story you know the deers mother gets killed but now he's going to take the deer it's a Bambi you know and like the walking around and depending the D or he's trying to do his meditation but the deer is snuggling with him and then all of a sudden he dies untimely meditating on the deer
 and he sort of thing like well it's good to take care of deers what's so bad about deers nothing is bad about taking care of a deer but sometimes we
great
 we're good it's good to take care of deers but you're about to leave your body in your bout to take birth again and this is where the bottom of time comes in its or like slamming down the Mallet it's the intervention hey wake up wake up
 yeah the store coming to my mind also that's a great reference you just made but all silenced or those could have my mind was the door into the rostra dhritarashtra again when do the rush is getting to the end of his life is supposed Battle of kurukshetra door just comes in and just has this sort of intervention with your garage door just as what are you doing right here at the fagg end of your life and you are just holding on to the scraps of life is British British people on the show is that a is that a British
see some now I say it all the time I'm just so yeah I work with where we're going to monitor all of uk-based team and I'm getting all these I'm learning all of these British phrases yeah put it up but either you're holding on to the scraps of somebody Dia of your material life that's just it never was true and it's no longer true now either and Now's the Time to get serious about your spiritual life like Takis I protect you in a rush to get finally pierced his heart to hurt it and then he went back and absorb yourself in a spiritual practice and scroll down to the script that's a great verse in the Bible time when video or comes back from pilgrimage
 the war is over Drita roster is living with you to steer who is trying to kill you was trying to kill you this year and you just you're such a gentleman he said well this guy's my uncle I know he was trying to kill me and all my brothers or my family but you know what he's an elder I got to take care of him so he's a living being her out of the door put it like you know what you're living like a house
dog yeah and then he goes through his body your Skin's wrinkled your teeth are falling out your eyes are your your hair if your hair is thinning you're going over his like appearance which was in one side was a little bit funny and then Junior Austria because he was in a trained he took it seriously and said you know what
 I'm leaving I'm leaving so we hear these things when we're in good health we hear these things when were physically fit but it's good to hear these things on a regular basis because it helps us cut you not tell the story of Hari Bhajan in my book and if if you haven't heard the story he was like a saw do that and I'll talk really short but it was decided that used to feed me and bring David when I was a young man and every day we would feed me and I never knew we spoke English we always like talked in charades and then be like a shy but he moved his hands around
yes yes yes and then one day I said I wish you spoke English I speak English and then we have this whole after a month of getting fed by the zoo and I said how did you get here like were you born in Born David he look like just like some hermit living in the clay hut and he said no no no I came here with my family when I was 35 and in the 50s
 and you know Indians go on vacation with their families and their 50s Cena Americans like after 14 I stopped going to vacation with my my parents but they're on vacation to a holy place and they were ready to leave
 and he said to his father I can't leave here
 Isabel what do you mean you can't leave for yes it's a very beautiful place for David he was no really I cannot leave
 he says I know but David is very nice but we have to get our trained he says father I will not leave here I will not.
reliever David in the publisher would we talk to you about you have it was a married but he said that you have a job you have a career you have your own business and he just said keep my business keep my well I'm staying here he said how will you live he said I'll figure it out and he never left and so sometimes we get that spiritual impetus and maybe Hari Bhajan got it from a young age or maybe it was just the right combination of factors in your life and you don't you know what it's over material life is over and sometimes we get to that point and to really we ball maybe everybody on the show is got to that point but we're not like, so therefore we like waiver a little bit just yesterday someone said you know what I apologize for being so up and down with my life
 guess what that's just part of having a bottom material body we go up and we go down we getting spy
and then we get whatever I've been up to fanatical and we go up and then I'm going to I'm going to go deep into some bad habits in those bad habits week and disgusted with our self and then we go in deeper again I got to get serious about this and she were more on a roller coaster than a straight line that's why I like you marry your very straight and parallel lines moving to the light I'm more like a rocky road how much a dirt road a dirt road in the Himalayas with sinkholes and potholes and crumbling Cliffs and Lena slides that's been more my life and I'm okay with that as long as it's going up eventually that's what I'm hoping
 will you been doing you've done 1273 episodes of Bollywood Tom steadily throughout the land because it's our daily activities
let's start to change us our daily activities start to change us and that's why this concept of sadhna is so important showing up for the same old thing it doesn't get old on a regular basis to meet it doesn't get stale if feels stale psych I don't feel like doing it today people do this with physical fitness I don't feel like running today I don't feel like going to the gym today I don't feel like doing yoga today but you show up and afterwards you like did it did it been there you know and if you're hitting that feeling like you're hitting a ceiling keep pushing and then it tastes become sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and Krishna seeing your sincerity and try to lure you right out of the material world
 yeah what are they got out of the special at babies we start to read these verses and we can get into it right after this is the lot of these verses in the Bible tell the story that you here makes sense when there's a sense of urgency in our lives.
begins with the urgency of March brexit who only had seven days to live to do or was impressing upon to the rest of the urgencies like you're at the bag and of Life which are in the chat said it's the expression of the end of a cigarette but that's what the heck is with a cigarette with a cigarette cigarette but yeah the fact end so that's where that comes from FYI all the kids called me a school bus to something with cigarettes okay I call you cigarettes so here off at end and the verse is leading up to this time we were at yesterday was all about how there's so little time in life do you spend so much time sleeping you spend so much time at work you spend so much time doing this and that you actually have a very very short amount of time available to dedicate to something important so there's this would you think life is good when you think you got lots of time we just like yeah there's this and that took it so fanatical it's assorted seems over-the-top but would you come back to a sense of urgency like I've got a very short. Of time I've got a lot
do this is really important have a very valuable opportunity being the human form of life to elevate myself out of the material world that sense of urgency allows you to receive these versus it a different way so one of the set that up
 where's a good place for a place where a good place in the history of Krishna Consciousness to I think it's a very good exciting Place remind me to tell you about a show that me and Mary washed it so now cuz we haven't read one verse yet was it murder or grotesque comedy to the Harry Krishna doll cashier in a moment as read some verses then I'll remind you about that how can a person who is most affectionate to his family intervention here so don't don't expect it to be like polished be right cutting an hour trying to prep a
how do I get to the whole episode without reading any versus raised his travel dates just so I'd have to deal with this about sinkholes in earthquakes in Italy and read them I'm just shocked that you actually prepare dragon on like you got together with the oil before the show and actually prepared something who said I did that I thought you just said you were you just said something like that when I got on earlier before the show is running up the stairs like I'm just preparing for the class for the straight guy he's a nutcase Good Luck Good Luck how can a person whose most affectionate to his family
the cord is heart being always filled with their pictures give up their Association that's interesting that they even have pictures back then was that mean I wonder maybe it goes metal pictures that people can draw paints there's a painting of my family okay specifically a wife or the husband people really are sweet with each other
 Ali wife was always kind and sympathetic and always pleases her husband in solitary places I mean sexually that's the innuendo who could give up the association of such a dear and affectionate wife has a spouse spouse small children talk in broken language very pleasing to hear just yesterday what was I telling you this. My son when he was little we used to sleep with him in bed he's to wake up and go Daddy
like waking me up to say Pooja I was like a little kid and he was just attracted to him you are adorable child small children talk in broken language very pleasing to hear and their affectionate father always thinks of their sweet words even now I'm recollecting this story
 how could he give up that Association one's elderly parents and one sons and daughters are also very dear I was talking about Grandma Terry
 a daughter is especially dear to her father as true right Sachi
 yep my daughter forget those Sons my daughter off is especially dear to her father and while giving at her and end while living at her husband's house right one. You get old and moves away moves in with her her new husband
 it's always in the father's
find how is she doing is she okay is he taking care of her you know I'm always telling her if anybody mistreats you let me know they have to be my boyfriend has to have the fear of the father instilled within them that's my fatherly advice for fathers of girls they need to know that there is accountability for their actions
 who can give up that Association aside from this and household Affairs are many decorated items of household Furniture right there is like Furniture you loving your house I can marry as we're getting marriage grandmother's rocking chair and they're also animals rightly guy or Gus who could give up such Comforts the attached householder is like a silkworm this is greater than a silkworm a silkworm which weaves a cocoon and which it becomes imprisoned
 unable to get out
simply for the satisfaction of these two important senses the genitals and the tongue one is bound by material conditions how can one Escape
 we think that I think that it's explain to us how easy it is to get wound up in the material world to some was like what is that word sadistic was like you don't notice how it's happening to you over time Insidious evil Insidious that's what it look for insidious where there's that sense of like yeah you don't sort of realized the way that you're kind of on all the sudden you're really really bound up and it is just saying it's really hard in the light of all of that too
 focus on something Beyond that's easy to get caught up this things that were attached to the most
 home wealth family none of those are evil per se at all a matter of fact when you look at like a
a family like I was thinking this morning because I'm doing a program in San Francisco with John to be I was reading this verse earlier like she's our spiritual family said her father's initiating Guru the mothers like a guru or sisters I can break your time later it's like
 that's what it sounds like abandoned family but you got to be careful with family members because they can very easily latch on and so we also have to see people in this world who are lifting us up matter fact
 you know is my older age to I have other so many young people in my life that I consider almost like my sons and daughters I like Maya I like a daughter of mine you know you know Alex from Sweden or are you know Tommy faucet they're like my son's not like other Sons cuz they're on this like spiritual trajectory the spiritual path and that current
taking us all somewhere and so there is
 material family
 can be Insidious like like a current of an ocean like ever go swimming in the ocean like in the summer at Jones Beach or at the Jersey Shore you're waving to your mom you like 7 years old and then you're like swimming around and I'm saying like where the hell is Mom and then you realize the current has dragged you a hundred yards you don't even notice you're not even a Riptide but but yes a Riptide to but when the currents are just drag you're still in the below water the Curtis pulled you down the beach so that is that we have to check in on a regular basis and that's why again sadhna were showing up for a regular spiritual practice going away for a weekend that's why we just super so far we do it so you can go away for a weekend ahead of a spiritual immersion at just like we are asada in the morning
like a pilgrimage of our day and we have your salad in the morning a live interview day then after you get a good taste for it then you have a pilgrimage at night you read a little at night you sing a little at night then you say I want to go away for a weekend then you want to go wait for a longer pilgrimage you wanted you know travel somewhere go to India go to a holy place to go to Italy whatever these are these are not Shameless sales techniques but but they are as well but they are as well because it's important to get away where you don't have to worry about the minutiae of material existence and you can just really focus on hearing and chanting and connecting with God and a community
 love story of a cat Steven's Universe Red Cat Stevens and the riptide I know I know Cat Stevens became a Muslim
cuz you was famous and he got overwhelmed with the fame flattering and fake validation he personally has he was like a rising star at the height of his career he was young and good-looking and super famous had big hits in the 70s or whatever it was and he was in the ocean he got caught in a rip tide or he got he got swept out into the ocean and he was wait never heard that he was he was way out there he was way out there and he just resigned himself to die he was out of town. I think I'm going to that it was it was one of those contracts like wow I have so much Fame I've so much money I've got so much you know you was probably did those young and every type of sense gratification Boggle time describes we can think of was afraid it was a straightedge and he realize you know what I am helpless in this expanse of the ocean and I'm nobody's nobody can see me or hear me I'm going to die until he just he he resigned
tell the guy that he made a prayer to God he's just like and I don't know what his religious or spiritual background was that if any but it's a job yeah was that furthers their do atheist in the Foxhole does that phrase we just got if you get me out of here I promise I promise I will give I will give my entire life to you I'll just get my entire life to you like just get me out of the situation I'll give everything up and I'll just completely surrendered to you and I wonder if he dabbled in violation of ism I don't know but he made that prayer and after I made that prayer somehow the the the curse shifted and he got swept up back to the shore and he's like I'm going to keep my promise and he ended his career he became a Muslim I don't know why you chose this number if there was a connection or not but that's what is a Harry Krishna I would have loved Cat Stevens as a Harry Krishna I love cat Steven's so but that was that was the story that was a story
I was also thinking of Ravenna Circle quotes this verse from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet were worth acatic it's 7:00 Julie to Robia one of them refers to the other as you're the god of my idolatry you're talkin about like your dick you're my object of worship know that you are the god of my idolatry where it's it becomes like you use. To replace God in my life and I think they're the real the real switch-a-roo is when we think that we're playing God other people's life right out of your source of protection I have your source of love we talked about that yesterday like ownership and we're actually robbing other people of their spiritual life because we're inserting our self as God in their life without recognizing that actually I bet to help you turned towards God and find out of your life and vice-versa so I like that
 yeah we never want to make someone else our God let God be your God write that down this
look out your God
 the silkworm creates a cocoon cocoon cocoon and he can't get out
 he created it he created his own demise
 is that a good one
 if you're if you're if you're in a spiritual household where your friends and family and partners in kids in your household dogs in your furniture or I'll bringing you higher
 then you are like a caterpillar who's transforming metamorphose sizing into a butterfly
 and you're not dying I guess you'll what you'll die. What will die is your old Shell
 write your old carcass
is so, is different than a caterpillar right after we get the we get the analogy we got because to use that analogy of what a bee in a beehive a wasp or something cuz you are you there
 what do you think a silkworm turns into a domestic silk moth so look at my house or a great be
 she was like I'm the Van Wyck gets trapped in a wasp is coming in all right should we keep discussing this first okay it's a purse
to attach to the duties of family made to do you skipped over 14 attach cannot understand that he is wasting your ego is valuable life for the maintenance of his family
 he also fails to understand the purpose of human life is a human life a life suitable for realization of the absolute truth is being imperceptibly spoiled however he's very cleverly attentive to seeing that not a single Farthing is lost by mismanagement that's although and attached person in material existence always suffers from the threefold miseries he does not develop a distaste for the way of material existence you know this reminds me and all you have to do is study the history sometimes of of kings and royalty and often times you were dealing with vast amounts of wealth people do at Rochas things
to get to inherit that well sometimes if a person makes a lot of money in their lifetime they think I'm going to be very gracious I'm going to distribute wealth to my children and then the person dies and the children are fighting over it or they won't speak to one another over it you think you're actually doing such a great Noble charitable thing but because those people aren't even qualified to deal with the energy of well which is an energy it's like it's just like me like me after a lightning storm and all the wires are hanging down and Mara says hey that we got a blackout in the house go fix those electric go climb that telephone pole and try to fix the electric I'm not qualified
 I'm not a qualified electrician
 Doyle sweat you to know that
 not even part-time electrician
 call Tricia yeah I want to talk about that
they are not sure the energy of wealth so so a person who focused on wealth and focused on their business and focus and then they distribute that well above and beyond people don't know how to handle it and it can it can ask it could Empower them it could have power if they don't I handle well
 or could burn them and ruin the very thing you want to give your kid could ruin their life does anybody have an experience of that listening on Zoom
 yeah I was looking up some
 can I can I can I read some some I was looking up cuz there was a couple things I was looking at this in this first cuz it just like it's interesting so we're hearing things of wasting life for the maintenance of family being so attentive to see that not a single Farthing is lost my business management right Rings like never have you statements but then you look at the life of property and it's interesting to see how
 it's not care
for children are being attentive to how money is being spent his evil it's it's it's when it's layered with a misconceived material Consciousness could probably was also extraordinarily careful with money but you actually read is like a really great book you can get I don't even know if it's in public anymore I think I have a copy of it it's like a coffee table kind of book and it's it's like the very early days of Prague pot in New York and it's got like a journal entries that he would let he would write that weren't meant to be published anywhere just for himself and he would he would document every penny that he's spent that every rupee every penny I went to the West End Superette on 7777 72nd Street what street was it cuz do the where he would go if it's still there today we would go buy vegetables 72nd and West End 72nd West said he would he would document every single pair
that you spent and there was some other so that was one thing in there was some other question every some really odd about shows so prepared I heard we this is this is a letter that should have brought the letter that Sheila Prophet wrote to Arun Tutti Frutti. It says. I thought that was dossier anyways you the one I wrote a trinity.
 Papa said the score for probably the letter July 30th arundhati in in July 30th 1972
 child worship is more important than DD worship
 if you cannot spend time with him in the child then stop the duties of pujari at least you take good care of your son until he's old enough after that you were able to take care of it and it did was say talking about like you to be going to community boating but he was
if you can't spend time with your kids and stopped at DD's of pujari was it like you must do your service and if your kids are getting in the way than just don't have kids or get to get out of the way she or he said these children are given to us by Krishna they are vaishnav as we used to be very careful to protect them it was another quote that he mentioned our children are the gift given by the mercy Lord they are delicate take care of them with love and devotion that he said by giving them Krishna Consciousness so you know there's other letters we can look them up and set her but I just seeing how I'm on one head you're sitting this whole heavy
 down criticism of material life and family it's better than and the same stroke probably would give letters but how boring it is to take care of your family in a spiritual context right so take a lot of a sudden you're reading problems book the same as it does a laser focus on one statement one word one line
properties very holistic and it went to really understand what proper to say again in one context you have to understand the gamut of prabhas teachings his writings the way he lived way he treated people in person and interacted so I thought those quotes and references were pretty cool culture now is expert at picking out one sentence out of something you said some time ago and holding you holding that sentence as you know this is what you're all about this is what's going to read on your gravestone and went in and it's just not appropriate you don't get the picture of the person from one sentence at a contacts and it's not just dropped on its the teachings of bhakti because this sounds in one sense very cold but you like you said
 the energy of money
 if you're looking at is this is mine and this gives me this is where I find my worth it's a material thing and will complicate your life
 and the energy of
family and love if if they think this is about me it will complicate my life but speaking of family yes why I love you
 my daughter saying goodbye I was sweet
 okay
 Carlos going
 number in the next 15 15 senses we're leaving she think about this when I get to see her I love you okay if a person is too attached to the duties of Family Maintenance and is unable to control his senses the core of his heart is immersed it how do I cumulate money
 you know I had to devote a friend told me about another friend of his was a devotee it was was good at business and he said he's somehow
got swept away in the ganga ever tell you the story Swept Away in the ganga and instead of like like you're going to die the guy he said he said instead of thinking of Christian I was calculating every like my my bank balance to the dime that's what I was thinking of it's in these extreme situations where is our mind what is our mind meditating on and so he said that in a very vulnerable way
 I'm sorry if a person to attach to the duties of found me this is unable to control his senses the court his heart is immersed and had to accumulate money although he knows that one who takes the wealth of others will be punished by the law of the government and by the laws of yamraaj after death he continues cheating others to acquire money you know another famous story I was going to top of that the wealth of Kings as you know the story of these Mughal Empire empire the the Mughal Emperors and the most notorious was this around zap he was famous
or in a literally creating email deicide just murdering brahmins and destroying temples thousands of temples destroyed
 are hundreds of Temple is destroyed including govindaji in burned oven and Madan Mohan and but anyway and he came to power when he was 14 years old in killing his father or in imprisoning his father he wasn't the eldest son so he he felt like the if you're not the oldest son you're not going to get anything on these grey royal bloodlines so we decided to create a coup and murder his brothers to take his father's well this is the first time these stories have been done what people do for money
 it's really quite scary and then people kill for it he he was what we're in the line of the Taj Mahal king or was either way I still believe that
a Shiva Temple but that's the that's the narrative they're giving now I got to feel that marriage is going to change cuz you know they're discovering all these things about Ancient Ancient Mughal architecture that a lot of it was just resurfaced ancient Hindu drugs that killed his father and his brother's son of the father it was Brothers
 okay let's go back to the house that was at the point the stories of what people do for money and the father is probably think he's doing very Noble things he's a very wealthy family and all my kids even though they'll all live like royalty
 but you can be possessed by this energy so devotees would become like a like expert electricians knowing how to use the energy to light up an entire city and if you find great
they can light up millions of lives
 and if you handling fame or beauty or wealth or strength or intelligence but you don't know how to handle that energy you can burn the place down how many great minds
 are going to take things like a i and ruin the world with it take things like you know technology and ruin the world with it but they can't handle the energy it so they use that to build bombs it was like fools do the atom bomb like great and it is genius has built these things
