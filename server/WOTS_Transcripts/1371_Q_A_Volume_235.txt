 enthusiasm for spiritual life is great and it's it's it's
quality I think you probably were always enthusiastic but when that good qualities engaged in spiritual life it becomes a caterer's light becomes joyful so happy you're here how can we serve you what's your question today brother soon so maybe my question to be helpful to other devotees as well in the fans of the show my question is that I'm finding that my old traits as a spiritual seeker can sometimes hinder my faith and shastra for instance when reading stress sometimes doubt until I fertilize too much or the inclination to connect points to ideas and texts that are outside of the Pocket Edition this is a problem when I read something fantastic cool outside of my cultural understanding or something that isn't unpleasant truth that I wish wasn't true that you can relate These Are Spiritual seeking Tendencies were useful for me to get into boxing but now I suspect it is hindering the deepening of my fate
 how can I transition from a spiritual Seeker in
deeper Pockets practitioner and quill my doubts when reading shastra thank you that things were like I remember being a teenager and praying God please show me the way to tell me the show me the show me the agree with that all but I don't know are there any other ways or any other ways I could not give up
 basically what are we asking pure love of God is a high bar and yeah and I can understand you do as far as like fantastic things that are maybe hard to swallow I always put that on pause and I and I look at what I can swallow and it and I start very simply what can I swallow because something
we are very fantastic things things that are like this must be a man and it's okay we can reserve that for thinking about later on in life but here are the basics that I do fully get and you can start very simple Rising early is good for me controlling my senses is good for me controlling my mind is good for me the thoughts are things that's good for me I should know that I got to be careful about my thoughts I got to be careful what I consume through my mouth I got to be careful of this sounds the sounds that are coming out of my mouth these are very very important and those sounds that are coming out of my mouth are affected by what I'm putting in my ears but what is the media I'm consuming what's going to happen is after a while you'll get a taste for high-level consumption it like like like people get addicted to superfoods local produce or fruit fruit fruit salad for breakfast you know I used to eat bacon and eggs and everything some people smoke cigarettes for breakfast you know what I mean but and then you can
no I never do that again you'll get a higher taste for what you consume spiritually because it's all information and we don't want low-grade information in the mind because that comes out of the mouth and we were saying yesterday how the words that come out of our mouths create an environment create people people are attracted to the things that come into work that come out of our mouths so we create friends we create relationships with great Partners we create a household with the words that are coming up our mouth and that all comes from what I can soon and you'll develop a healthy addiction for those things and the repulsive things you'll move away from those things how do I get talking about this here rolling I'm sure if it's connected to the question
practice Yeah and then you go in in in that higher taste you will move forward and I put a pause on these things we can't understand of course we don't understand everything you know I can understand how my Watch Works cuz I can read the time I can understand the time but I can't understand how the actual watch works I'm going to have to peel that stuff apart that's going to take time to figure out there is a way it works cuz it works and how do I know it works cuz it's telling me time but I don't know how to build that watch I can't even quite figure out how this microphone works or how a text message works but it's working and there is a way to figure it out and if you want to figure it out keep taking tiny steps forward but understand at least now you can tell time and you're getting benefit from the time
 what are things to do with your benefit from that time
 what do I think like my own answer
I said what I said and what do you think about in general as you know so this practice and it's it's potty vedanta right it's a it's a practice of approaching the end of all knowledge they did they did a hunter Wright & in the way that is practice their central part perhaps the most central part is it's done through inquiry that one person is asking question to another person who's revealing the answer based on The Vedic texts
 and but whenever we want to approach anything you know it is it is necessary if you want to understand truth that we questioned it and kind of questioning that you don't have to do with them when we really have to test it you know you have to test it and when you test something
the way it has something good like particularly like up a philosophy or a Doctrine or whatever you have to try to find the weakness in it or try to find the inconsistencies in it and so that that's where the mine goes it's it's almost like a lawyer and I will try to find the weaknesses in an argument and then that's where you pull on the string and then it starts to fall apart. So that's what we do when when we're trying to approach these different philosophies about life even with invade on to the different presentations of they don't do we have to try to is there a weakness there is there strings I can pull on it does it start to fall apart
 so that's good we wanted we want to do that and end it sound sounded to me like that's part of what your question is about like I'm doing a lot of that but I'm not sure if it's always helping me is it is that is that kind of I kind of hung track and sometimes you know my mind will you know
doubts or yeah yeah and that's that's to be expected that you do now in the cheats on you charge a razor that's such a beautiful important text I'm Bucky the author krishna's cover that you wrote this one is he is writing these chapters in the Audi Lila in the beginning of their just chock-full of
 dance incredible information you know that philosophy and if they don't they don't do presentation any any said Erase this he says that if you are indeed interested in logic an argument then kindly apply it to the mercy of shooter nemaha Provo and if you do
 you'll find it to be strikingly wonderful
 what a great statement and any of this is coming from a person that's like a
 philosophical genius you know like he did these discuss while I'm there sitting in for David in like going deep into vedant the deep enough he said if you apply to treat you treat your tongue is presentation of ball TS
comes through G+ group anema little grass today of a connection here right as it comes to him and is there just an alternate how it's how it's how it's churn to its very essence in the shoe did Bob Tom Rich attorney present that and if you turn your questioning to that turn your turn your forget how you characterize but do you do you like habits or whatever of this kind of what I'm looking for investigation you know this kind of Investigation if you turn it to that you're going to find a strikingly wonderful if it but of course
 that assumes that we're doing it in the right mood that as soon as they were approaching you know he's it has to approach the right way like imagine
 if you really knew a subject
 and then someone who didn't know it was trying to see how well you knew it and so at the beginning their place in question
do you wear the trying to find if there's any kinks in your presentation any weaknesses and you answer those consistently and clearly a thoroughly illustrating that you know your subject
 and then they kind of said okay you're you're I think you're the guy I want to go with I think I want to continue to go into the deeper but as you went deeper into the subjects and some of them might have be difficult for that person understand they never gave
 it's not that they never gave up the questioning
 but they continued at a certain point you're going to be like I'm ready to answer any question you have been in any doubt that you have you can bring it forward
 but you have to stop viewing me is kind of like an enemy I like and and at a certain point you're going to have to have a little faith in me and use the use that face as what's going to help you
from one platform to the next and when you get to that other side it's not that it's you you have nothing but the face left but that face will help you get to the place where you understand yourself and you can explain if you could find it we always want the sermon with us that was beautiful you only want the sermon we carry that with us as we go to auction in containers sharpen intelligence in this beautiful Point these Great Master like Christian Dass kaviraj incredible philosophical mind when I say if you said hey there's this guy I dealt with an incredible philosophical mind often times there's a very big ego wrapped up in that we're talking about people with Incredible intelligent credible philosophical mind whose hearts are wide open there gushing if they just want to serve you and take care of you a nurse and love you up it's like a whole different animal and we've met people in our lifetimes with
Community Christian right who are the brainiacs people you never talk to them sometimes they're talkin on higher levels but have a different thing about they have a heart about them that's so wonderful as beautiful as quality to sleep right now so therefore within but even unto understanding knowing that this is a process of student inquiring from teacher teacher if it's a descending knowledge
 are you present the questions they present the answers but the connection happens it's it's
 what the shastra itself tells us as well as all of those that are coming to the tradition
 is it saying with this knowledge with his grade of knowledge with this
category of knowledge the most refined knowledge
 it's some it's not merely academic so it's not something that you just like any other subject that you might master
 in Academia because it is the very substance of what we're trying to abide is spiritual in nature
 it's only going to the transfer
 is only going to go into it it's only it will only be transferred into the mind of the heart of one who's accepting it
 in in the way that it can take take root and grow in one and that has a lot to do with the condition the heart and that is except in the etiquette to
 to create that fertile mind and heart has a lot to do with how you approach the person that you're questioning
and so that there for like an bug of agita when it gets down to like how do you question the guru you know the very famous first tugba T-Pain T-Pain Tina the repression and I say be a party person and I like putty means coil going around right so like you can question is from all around from every angle you can question you can be diligent and thorough
 but it says pre personal savior but you also have to render service to the person that you're questioning that's part of the formula for the knowledge being transferred because that's going to cultivate the right mood the mood of respect the mood of Simplicity that humility if that's not they're the real thing doesn't it did it really doesn't transfer Rite Rug vegans hold your ears it's like a it's like milking a cow you can't just say
give me a little love and love them and they give more milk that yes it's so it's so that so it's so really the answer to your question you need to find someone or some people that answer your questions while that you trust a drunk enough to write in his book he writes about like how it is early days he's coming around this is passing this make a lot of sense I don't know those kind of weird I'm just some stuff is little bit hard to swallow people aren't able to win if you would ask some more questions if they would even give him the time of day he would get sometimes he's kind of what's the word I'm looking for these kind of wrote rote rote stock kind of answers like Without Really Trying to hear you or hear your dad or dress your dad without the sensitivity of the refinement to actually make a sink it so he found someone like that in such a rush for boo
 Steven Rosen and and that's where the growth took place that's where like
the face grew that's weird cuz he had to the right person that could answers questions and then he found more people like that as he went on so you know that's our thing to you notice mudroom come on you you have to you have to approach a group
 and really did the address to surrender to the proposed Jetta and jignasa Truth when we have to really sincerely question about what's the highest good
 and and then you know shoved a put a transmission Autumn that this person has to be lernard fully Buena thoroughly studied in and shoved her in this in this song this knowledge through sound in putty and they say you can say put a shub shub day parade means
 this higher sound or you can also added to the charges say that per day they're means with God you know like they need
need to have the need to know there's nothing I need to have some experience in connection to the Supreme and I need to be detached from material things you find that kind of person in your life and you place your questions in the right mood and then you'll find your house will be full disintegrate but you have to realize that she was going to speak in many different ways like we were talking a little bit about the difference between the Western mind in the Eastern Minds earlier in the week remember that and ends like I think our Western minds want like okay you come down from the hill with the with the carved out Commandments big stone tablets is carved in there is not going to change is not flexible it's like really just simple tell me what not to do and let me go have it and you know it's kind of like that and and and and this Easter Traditions like it's going to speak to you on whatever level you're at it's going to sound different
little contradictory sometimes cuz it's so broad is going to speak to you sometimes it's going to speak to you like like a edge tablet that's never going to change and sometimes it's going to speak to you like any shades of grey shades of grey in a very human way like it'll speak in a more human way like using phrases and someone that that are more flexible little speech you like a friend sometimes sometimes I can speak to you like a teacher you know is Joshua speak to you in all these different ways and some of that experience with his going to help you understand no you don't have to try to squeeze it into your little mind box in that shape accept it as it is
 and understand that it's speaking to you in another way you know it end in that's the is that kind of refinement that can help us kind of get over some of the turtles that are just like the bumping up against this thing and it's just not fitting you no good answer good answer thank you
I'm with q and a day today Miss Mara who's next on our Andrea Kay from Beaver PA now she's so nice
 she's got an incredible community in Beaver Pennsylvania it's called the sungguh sakit answer and eating a live this microphone ain't your car you got to speak right on that Mike like her lips like right here what do you know about Beaver Pennsylvania Pennsylvania it's a Dry Town not drink alcohol in Beaver that must be like some old school old school Quaker things actually more like a docket or not we're not said that if this is going to be for a town for people you're not allowed to drink alcohol here so it's like a perpetually or whatever dancing of showing your ankles either
the ball is in their Court they could have just stick it in anything you could have said I could hop on one foot on Sunday so and it was like yes 12 years Wanderlust Festival it was West Virginia Bhagavad Gita for dummies cuz I had that was me from following us around last time at the farm, it's super special so thank you to Lori he was our teacher the weekend so she's amazing Lori's grade isn't she I don't think she's ever ever ever missed a podcast episode not only that but practically speaking never missed it live live
like I'm just like heard it while she was like cleaning the basement or some like that she actually just is always their number one first person and has been ended with me like eight times and she's and she's a very powerful or influential page yesterday I didn't know Paige a nice girl from from Newport and you know a lot of people just know they're there Yogi's from Newport and I was like a jump and listen podcast everyday and Lori is just like inspires people and so we're happy lohri bags here but you're here and wreak a few pages here what is what your question Boo and thank you for all of this because it's really changed my life if you're a good teacher too she's a very good teacher all the people on the podcast I feel like not all but I met a lot of them
change to I am as a person and I say this all the time it's made me a better person I'm going to get them it's okay cry what's the name of your yoga studio thank you for PA Beaver PA from Pittsburgh but my grandparents and my father grew up in Ellwood City Pennsylvania which I think is right next door or is it a so it's Beaver County but there's a town of beaver which is kind of a city it's like this is called a beaver not a squirrel visit your family do program in Beaver PA
yeah we went to the studio when he was in town last time ya got upset last time I went there. There's some kind of Revolution know is great with a great program and yeah a lot of my students got to go and hear you speak so it's going to think you I think hot bug of agita is the next bad that's going to happen I'm understanding chapter 7 now but I'm sweating like a dog and a degrees in the room all right I feel like this is a bad word but election anyway with the upcoming election I'm finding Division and friend groups family along political lines in your backyard
yeah it was right north of where I live and I don't want to be caught up in the anger negativity with people in my life because there's be a lot of people in my life I very much respect and and you know do things with all the time and in different ways but we have very different political views very different and I don't want to get caught up in that anger and because it feels like it's everywhere and it's so divisive super devices I'm trying to figure out the best way to deal with that from a body perspective should I distance myself from them for this short. Unfriend people from social media or just like that for a little while I want to stay even minded in myself and I don't want to ruin relationships over something and as we talked about gets its temporary and that's how I'm trying to think of it so I'm just looking for some advice on that
 that's a great question that's a great question
 you want me to take a shower you want to go first
does she like you know there's a highest truth there's a highest truth in the highest truth is that we're all Spirits Souls were lost in the material world our hearts are breaking with falling in love or getting money or losing money as long as we have these bodies we go to the changes and the pain of material existence
 but we're Spirits souls and we're desperately looking to invest our love and our hope and our faith somewhere and when we don't have Spirit God in our life we invest it in ideas from in perfect peace movement movement party isms sometimes in a b a a b in a person at a pet or in a car or a hobby and we invest it there may be a simile in music Asher take that love and invested in the highest truth and
I think it's safe to say cuz to myself
 it's not like we were just like we don't have any opinions of this material world but we felt like if we give our Life to source that will be the routes that we water that will solve all the problems of this world as here's one little example I was a big interested in animal rights I was very vocal very bold had a huge platform to speak on made got the bike tens of thousands of people into vegetarianism big Rhythm that being said is that the best and highest truth I could give somebody after really thinking about it I felt no it's not why because you can be a vegan or vegetarian and still be a complete jerk you know if you could still be angry you can be hateful I'm so so the highest thing is where we have to change people from the very core of their character to learn how to love not just people that are like us and that commit to our political party or commit to our
ideas or ideology but learn to love people that are even different from us this is going back and forth we talked about this week I'll be seated in political debates you know he is the woke student we're not interested in crushing anybody we're interested in unearthing people soul and seeing people for their great potential and if I compromised giving people the highest truth and go to my ideas of what political party is first of all no idea who the massive puppeteers are behind this entire political system but if we come now he has friends who are the people is being directed by one person now there's heems of think tanks in creating our laws in this world so anyway why compromise this highest truth or some lesser truth that we are so
speculating on and we don't even know if even if we speculate and say yeah this is the best nicest group of political people we could vote for is that actually mean the best thing for our country anyway we have no idea where clueless were short-sighted or armchair critics why compromise the highest Truth for some lower true that we don't even know about so we say the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing and the main thing is worse. So I was lost in the material world
 and I want to reconnect with source and that's going to be the highest thing going back to the analogy of animal rights
 I want to give people not just a good thing and not just one of the good qualities you get out of body but if you give them the highest thing all good things will come from that you water the roots of the tree all the leaves become satisfied and we see that proud pod himself he just breathe pure bhakti
but I know tens of thousands of people who got into vegetarianism animal rights just because he reached a message of non-violence they have become devotees percent but they they they got serious about it but a lot of people did take spiritual life seriously they also realize wow there's a soul in the animal matter fact that's a very common thing people say when they preach about animal rights will say oh you do animals are being so you do animals are conscious beings people say those things if you want to be ethical we should care about the ethical treatment of animals I give that credit to these Swami's insane so I probably came here in the sixties and taught that truth because previously in my generation growing up in previously animals were just Stone they were Commodities they were things that we we have dominion to do whatever the hell we want to do with them we can love them or can cut their throats and that's just not true so our Point our point is you give the highest and all those other things
become covered we all be and so he didn't have to bomb a slaughterhouse he didn't have to glue the locks of a you know Fourier or spray paint a break Windows he just taught bhagavat Dharma you know that we are we are souls and we're lost and we need connection and in that connection all good things come keep the main thing the main thing
 thank you I wish I could strap you know I was thinking I appreciate your your pro cheer your thoughtfulness to this I was thinking we were going out tonight were young young men Ramen digital Village of random people and Village People so but when we were kids you know we were into these
oh I got to the best turbo scenario for David Village People one guy to your liking or a diamond that you're making the Tulsi malas you're making the Tulsi mileage you're the Poo jari jari we have to have different my lifelong guys if you want guys like a outfit guys doing down there but for a crumb boy have you satisfied your need two squirrels back in the cage. Okay so when we were kids we were into the underground youth kind of subcultures the yippies remember the yippies are not happy is that they're still around but that wasn't our thing
you do it in a lot of it was kind of a happening in like in England and in America
 there is Connection in the subcultures and all that and in right as we're coming into it in the early eighties there was like a real in England there was like a real push for the national front which is like they're kind of
 radical right-wing radical right-wing now cuz stupid may we witnessed it there are there like right in our face on a regular basis and yeah and so that they were they kind of try to drive a wedge into the youth subcultures in England
 and that kind of bled over into the states as well and so and there was no in the different bands, they all responded to it in different ways and what beautiful thing that kind of grew out of that at the time was like all the Ska music which was you know it was iconic it was like
Vons to that you know it was the bands were kind of like multiracial and the music had this theme of unity me to see that or even a little earlier or 80 started in and that the ban of specials are probably the most important man that that were involved in all that in the end Jerry dammers was like the their song writer in the kind of like that the The Mastermind behind the whole this no not this is right I got to put that squirrel away I'm on point here I'm not point but I seen with Jerry dammers he was like kind of The Mastermind of this whole very nice you know kind of beautiful anti-racist musical movement
 and then when the specials broke up he had another band called special at Kay and they released one song I don't know if you remember this Ragan.
 It's right on point you're going to see about isolated as you're going to be in your back pocket go ahead
racist friend
 see how you say I'm kind of back in here in a song called racist friend
 and this delear sweat if you have a racist friend now is the time for your friendship to end and I said did your sister beat your brother be your cousin your uncle your lover if you have a racist friend now is a time for your friendship to end
 and you know like I think as kids were like yeah that's right you got to take a stand you got you know you yet and when I began to learn about what spirituality really meant I saw that it was a deeper understanding it was a deeper understanding of what like racism is or and racism is just one topic that divides us but we have fought magana we have knowledge of the self in that knowledge itself is running through sync it is that the rising tide lifts all boats it is
it is that what's what's the word on did the one medicine that likes cures all disease is Panacea Panacea is the Panacea because what it helps us understand is that behind not only the body but behind the mind is the self and the mind gets warped by it gets wore Tire experience so one. It's just like if if the same year you can have two people that grow up under different circumstances and if you would have just switched at birth they might have each embrace the opposite attitudes you know it because we get shaped by our external experiences unless were very
 thoughtful are determined not to be and so both so what the spiritualist understands is we we might stand against a stance that someone's talk but we don't stand against the person that took it and
and if we're ever going to be able to
 positively influence one another
 it's more likely that's going to happen through friendship and respecting each other than by breaking friendships I like that sometime it was a couple months or so few months that it was a while back on the show we did a nugget about this one black gentleman who went in to the KKK
 and made friends with the members of the KKK and rather than rather than like pose as like a someone that's like you know a fighter against them he
walked in there just said let's try to understand each other and miraculously he actually transform like hundreds of KKK members you know by by by maintaining friendships I get what you're saying it can be hard to it can be really disturbing to the mind and I think the things that you brought up or probably are things you want to seriously consider do you know maybe I just going to stay away from social media and maybe I just got to be careful who I sent you because you don't want to break those connections use those connections to to try to upload uplift one another like that cuz they're going to answer but answer right and your cat
 yeah I want to give a shout out to grace young was listening in burned oven oven and Maya's driving home listen to us I see you're out there tell Grace young she wrote into a sudden she she she was under the impression
we coined the term medical tourism but we didn't actually have a huge thing I said something different but I said
 what's the other thing I said I said something else too or is it all like always like Pilgrim interval Richard I said about she's at the airport right now she's at the airport I said medical pilgrimage remember medical field because people are going to India for men maybe you did okay I call you medical pilgrimage saying I'll take full credit for that.
 Sandy come on Sandy
 Marta we got to do Sandy and Marta so let's do this
 all right come on down Sandy right into the make your mom passed away
is closed like this welcome Sandy Sandy what's your story
 I'm from Tiverton Rhode Island and this is my first time here have you ever heard the podcast before I bet your yoga student of Lawry's you came on the retreat had no idea what your stepping into a good weekend yesterday do you like your tongue I love I'm sorry to hear tone was that your first your time
 sort of yes or no real one yes yes yes but I'm learning how to play great and what and what do you do in Tiverton I bartend and I teach yoga and I sing in a band okay
map to Phoenix ass out there and what's your what's your question today dear don't have a heart palpitation any moment everything is good if I die from a heart problem
 so I don't know if this is a good question but I'm about to tell you if it and I do believe me we what do you call it
 we check out what if it starts with the V we that prevent all these questions so it's already past it's already past the vetting process unless you have them one that's why I've been a kind of on a spiritual path after I got to eat the microphone I'm on but I'm confused and and I read many years ago swipe
what does a 5 get the quote wrong but I think it was ramakrishna who said it doesn't matter where you dig your well as long as you dig it deep and that was a metaphor for finding your connection to God or to sacredness in the highest truth and so I've kind of spent my life digging if you could see my spiritual backyard it says like a million little a little holes how do you know when you found the right or how do you know where to keep digging that's because because I will then maybe go a little overtime too because it's cool purnima
 all right so this is Guru purnima is the birthday the parents day of Shield of Yas ativa now are you familiar with Shirley Bassey diva
if this is a crime everyone should know anyone that even comes near yoga should know him right off the bat right we're going to get out of here all of the ancient Vedic literature all the upanishads in The Vedas and the bug of agita in the Mahabharata and looks like the shooting bombs how much we read from every day on a podcast
 there's this massive body of literature that all of the yoga teachings come from and they all came through one person it is and it's not exactly that he wrote them all but he was like he was a sage that kind of bomb downloaded them you know like mystically accessed and then he wrote them all down any road a huge body of literature knowing that we're going into a darker age he wanted to write it all down and he wanted to divide it all up and categorize it all and in ways that made it easier to understand and it was these
they can't just remember things they just can't remember to write it down and then what happened in 1995 was like these people wanting to read things anymore we're going to have my audio books don't even read any longer that's where we're at right now and so he wrote These massive collection of things like 200,000 versus Arsenal like 20,000 versus which was the four Vedas these are books that teach you how to be like a good righteous person and how to get good karma and enjoy the world in a in a righteous way
 and then he can pose books called upanishads 108 books that were about you know what that enjoying the things of this world it's it's it only goes so far and it's always followed by suffering I'm not of this world I'm not this body I'm something Beyond this let me turn with instead of trying to find happiness to external things let me go with sand and try to find my own place when they chew
let me renounce this world
 and then he wrote butt and then he said you know what these books are only for like very few people can Priests and renuncies can understand these books let me write books for the masses and he wrote stories like the Mahabharata with the bug of agita in it and the Piranhas or to the couch collections of book stories and he began to speak more in those books you also began to speak more about this devotional side that you know what is one thing to enjoy this world is nothing to renounce this world but higher than both of them is like Divine love which kind of employees it kind of employees the best of both of those eyes and go still further I wrote all these books and then he was feeling depressed and you couldn't understand why am I depressed what what's not right and he began to realize I've written so many books on so many different subjects and I've approached people on whatever level they are at
 if you're into the things amateur world I've got books for you the babies if you want to reject this world I got books for you
the other point of shot if you if you want to
 if you want to find like a connection it with love to the Supreme I can buy provided those books too but he realized I haven't emphasized Divine love enough because that's this is actually an evolution it moves in this direction from becoming righteous within the world to reject in the world to transcending both of those
 and in finding Divine love and through love of God love with every living being and he saying people are going to look at my books and they're not going to do good they can make two mistakes potential they can make some mistakes one is that they could consider less mature teachings to be the conclusion and now they're going in the wrong direction or two they could think that all of these teachings are of equal value and in this way they're never going to progress towards the conclusion
 and so would ramakrishnan said about like you can ditch it doesn't matter
are you dig
 yesterday was concerned that people would interpret it that way
 and therefore he was like all the teachings are you cool it doesn't matter which one they're not going to understand the progression
 and so he went back any refined the book called issue involved with him where he explains it all of these teachings move in a direction from being righteous and good with in this world and enjoying the prosperity of this world to recognize and the futility in the things of this world and leaving the World Behind and and that's like thesis antithesis to swing from one side to the other synthesis is where it's all meant to go and everything is synthesized in Divine love and so therefore books like the bug of agita and issue involves time to come most his most important works so this is how we we understand your State vs Davis texts and ramakrishnan service him in a different way shankaracharya interpreting them it's still different way but
I would say that those that move you towards the vine lover moving towards the conclusion and it's it's not that one is bad and the other is good it's an evolution that we naturally go through from being materially dharmik and righteous to leaving the letting go of things in this world to embracing Divine love that's the evolution
 so what you're saying is if you start digging a hole in you find a little trickle of that Divine love than there or or we would also say if you're digging your kind of going through these layers of first being righteous in the world then letting go of the things in this world and ultimately getting Divine love that's another way you could say to but you got to keep digging
 you know listen to Back episode of the podcast read Punk to munch me home has all the answers eventually don't want to rip them all can you dig like they are okay I just made it a very simple
not through my journey I go through that all these different philosophies and you already known me and you're the singer of a band I think you can relate to it and brought it back into my life but also and then eventually eventually or maybe right away will be like you know I want to read the Gita as well but the back episodes of stupid me explain the stuff in a very short of palatable way that's not too lofty that I think you'd like and then from there you dive into the more esoteric or philosophical things start little everyday but every day that's how we get better at everything we do a little bit every day and what kind of music do you do we play in Newport couple times a month usually at the Atlantic Resort sometimes Dan he's the head of the band and I play a Duo o at the Newport Elks we do a lot of like 6070 stuff Motown
 no no more like the Grateful Dead or Alive
yeah but this is all we got to school. Thank you very much Sandy great to have either another word for bringing down another Phoenix money for right now there's a band called Phoenix in in money for you. Phoenix or money for come on Martha Martha speaks perfect English but you're like oh you going to make fun of my Spanish she's from Spain and I don't want you to hear I don't want to hear any apologies about your English is perfect when we don't have it right the first of all
 did he ever listen to his messages
consistently has page but okay and are you familiar with bhakti at all the teacher I work with tiny humans and I teach Star Wars
 I'm a teacher and I tried to have them do yoga at 2 so it would be lovely to do children's yoga on the show so far diverted to your question dear honestly all of my questions have been very well answered through these three previous question so I do feel nervous and that's why I didn't really want to come up I find ya want to throw a wild-card in the mix 2
 maybe maybe we can touch a little bit of went with you and I spoke about yesterday about the the smaller smaller Goods versus a greater Goods
I struggled a lot with understanding the bigger path and in the bigger picture and on when on the suffering on earth when when good people or when good has to suffer a lot and go through bad things happen to good people to a very tragic accident when they were younger and for very very long time I always wondered why why why this person was so good that the world deserves her and she deserve to live a life on this planet I'm she worked at the Peace Corps and she was just the best human being I've ever met she was my best friend and sometimes you see these evil people make us stronger than ever
 why is this happening and sometimes he likes to do my hands up in the air and I my God why why can I share this beautiful story with me yesterday in and let's see if you remember the points
you can tell us I think that's okay how do you say hot seat in Spanish it is it's quite nice cuz it kind of stay in a little bit with even just the back of the pizza in the beginning of that sentiment of like I am a warrior and I don't want to kill right because of killing supposedly if you if you classify thinks is good and bad feeling is is bad and I don't want to do bad things I don't want you go to win so why would I kill him but then he says don't be weak of heart your your your goal is like you're supposed to kill right and I am and then I'm like the killing is bad then why do this and I think what I understand is that I didn't say I didn't say this by the way she's not around you have
 the Dharma was that he is a warrior
the greater good so I guess understanding that sometimes bad things were things that I would consider our painful and hurtful have to happen with the ultimate better greatness of goodness and even just tying it back to why why does my friend not get to live on this planet and live a life and provide them to spread love like I said she wouldn't made it I smelt the rug and that's when I said thank you because now I can understand that maybe she was released of the suffering of what this Earth is and in fact she is in a better place and although I still struggle with what's been left behind like the pain that happens from the people that we still here I guess it helped my heart calm down and I understand that there is a bigger picture and again maybe not questioning just to have this faith and I'm a little nervous enough
takes a step forward in our spiritual life I use the example which I always do with a good example of Ganga Devi
 if you're just seeing how they say that they say that again gave you did what every time she had a child of Shanta know it's the beginning of the mob art music through this child what you said tragic tragic and the husband was freaking out never question anything she does she throws seven children in the ganga and on the 8th child
 he refuses no you can't take this child you can't kill this child and she said okay you question me now I must leave I will not kill this child but you should understand the bigger picture I am gunga Debbie herself and in the previous life we had a romantic Affair that wasn't appropriate
for the higher planets we had to take birth on this earth live out our passions and now I'm leaving we were never soulmates like that we were coming together for us we had our thing we had our thing it so it was beautiful it was beautiful Let It Go but these children they're also from a higher planet and they were cursed to take birth on Earth and immediately be liberated so they were asked for and liberated they asked her to do it and so this last one
 he actually was cursed to live a very long time so this last one he's going to live so here's my point from the vantage point on Earth
 these children who were killed immediately how horrible this is tragic it doesn't get more tragic than that but we don't see the bigger picture we see what's right in front of our eyes but from the zoom that picture these were the Blessed chill
where is this last one who gets to live a very long time is whole life was tragic this is Grandfather beasman Noble wonderful left with Krishna but he actually suffered so much he was cursed to live a very long time and he was the cursed child so we don't understand what happens maybe a person has to burn off some Karma and even a great Soul matter fact may be some great so has it to burn some Karma it's hard for us to under to let go of someone we love but for that person it's over and that might be our perspectives is from our perspective it's hard to judge who's fortunate and who's unfortunate yeah yeah we just think death is unfortunate no way that could be very very fortunate
 and I think that's one component of this and actually there's quite a few other components around this very multifaceted topic
the so-called Ram randomness of pleasure good fortune and bad fortune it's not random it's perfect and it work and we understand and give us examples some people actually their entire life is painful
 but even the life 100-year Life's a centenarian in the Eternal picture of time that is equivalent to blinking your eyes blink Martin it it's just a blank and we have to see ourselves as bigger than this time and space that there's we're actually Eternal souls and it's just ups and downs big eruption bigger down but there is a benevolent energy a benevolent source of benevolent deity a benevolent God that whatever it's going we are just learning lessons and then by the mercy of great Souls who come to this earth and extend their hands
was out-of-this-world of the cycle of a repeat of birth and death and there's that other story that I think we try to tell we never quite got a ride or maybe I screwed up or someone would that story about like there's a saw doing this Village policeman and there was called him to ask questions and one day like just you know how like in a village like all the chickens you know the roosters in the morning they all start when the Sun rises they're all like that we got that has stopped doing that one day and every one of the villagers singing that strange the rooster stop Roussin yeah I could doodle doing and then they went to the shop and they said this is really strange all the rooster stop stop stop doing their thing
 it seems I have only or something like that can you explain this to us and what did he say right now
 I remember he said something like, you know it's hard to understand what
doing worse it's all good but it could be a good thing or something like that he said some answer like who let us see what God wants or something like that and then then then to another thing happened like that and the third thing on there and then like one of those like fire fire didn't work anymore like to start fires and nobody can start a fire and that was like really considering they went back to the side and now we can't suppress was a chicken that was the other thing that I wasn't even starting fires what is going on help us you're the only man you're supposed to know then let's see what God wants in there like that you just get totally frustrated with him you know where like it's a good I think it's a good thing you know God will reveal its you know and they're just like enough of this old guy bearded idiot sitting around here doing nothing accomplishing zero not giving us any answers
 and then then the next night there was like these Invaders that they're they're just stacking one Village after another you know and it was nighttime almost morning and and they came to the outskirts of that Village Inn
look in the shed hole in there okay let's go stack that Village and they said hold it hold it
 it's no good roosters crowing around and do you know they would be waking up right now and it making the sound and there's no fire actually can't see one fire over there and it must have these people must have known that we were coming and they've all taken off and then they just avoided that thing and then they all had to go back today so it's hard for us to understand what's going on but there's always as benevolent hand behind a guy really liked that the benevolent hand thank you so much.
