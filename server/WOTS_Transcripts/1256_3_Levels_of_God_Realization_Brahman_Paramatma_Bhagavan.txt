 you're listen to the body recovery podcast today Mara
 it's a great podcast that she has the ability to go very deep very quick cut through all the nonsense shout out to Gigi
 are you ready to dive into some nuggets in your I am you got what you got to do what can you tell me about loud Sue rubbing I don't know I don't know much about the man while he was very wise he was a Wikipedia says he was a semi legendary ancient Chinese philosopher
 what I think they mean by that but I think that me and my semi-legendary is that like
 he's like I don't think they're saying is not quite legendary
white make legendary status or something I think they mean that a lot of what is said about him is Legend it's not necessarily true you know it's okay because they mention a little lower down modern Scout scholarship who knows what they know modern scholarship generally regards his biographical detail was invented and his Opus a collaboration to be to be a scholar you got to come and say will hold it you know what your stuff down to say that they said that you can even in Vedic thought right I'm 12 now he claimed to be a city or something unless they are down and I was talking about the mahajan's what makes him a hot jump out the best we can do is
follow in the footsteps of the Maha Jones The Great Falls is always a place for the established and thought and then another flies are comes and tears that down a building next to an up and seems to be a constant thing going on so what's how how do we know what's right what's wrong you look what is it that you look at the Into the Heart of the the great Souls you don't follow in their footsteps that's where you find the truth
 now as our daily ritual continues organized is frozen and he's not here or are allowed to nugget hopefully he'll be back in a minute or so I'll read a little bit more about to see if we're going to comes back this is loud Sue he's the author of The Tao Te Ching the foundational text of taoism along with the sound GT bouncy
 forgive me for mispronouncing that Natsu is a chime
honorific typically Transit as the old Master modern scholarship again regarding his biographical details as a vented and his Opus as a collaboration traditional Council that he was born as Lee are in the state of Chu in the sixth Century BC during China Spring and Autumn. Dan. He served as the Royal archivist for the zoo court and Wang Chang modern luyang
 any night in impressed Confucius on one occasion and compose The Tao Te Ching in a single session before retiring into the Western Wilderness Okay so
 whatever we do know about him he has an interesting quote here I'm going to read the quote are you ready people here we go according to loud say to the key to gross
 is the
of higher dimensions of consciousness
 into our awareness I will read that again for you the key to growth
 an enormous sensus doesn't sound too profound but actually I believe it is and then I'll discuss why the key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of Consciousness into our awareness we might think the key to growth is to develop a skill we might feel the key to growth is to gain something external weather might be well for might be the same or might be whatever might be what I what I find interesting about this in helpful about this and what I find in this that kind of runs parallel
 to our teachings and inbox yoga is that oh hey we got really bad
sorry about that nice old school India where the electricity was just go out and over the days 19 hours seems like it doesn't everyday at this time like I know exactly how to catch you ready to move the time we might have to move the time
 and so I rather not have to read again I was just getting into the key to growth
 is the introduction of higher dimensions of Consciousness into our awareness how do you how do you interpret that it's not what he's saying anything external we might think that the key to growth is like to go somewhere to see something different you know to leave where we are in a but the way that I'm understand he's saying as we can be sitting where we are now
 we can be living the same life that we're living now but we could be seeing it if we if we were exposed to
and if we absorb and incorporate higher dimensions of Consciousness into our awareness
 then we can see exactly what we're seeing now but see it from another perspective or as he stood language that you know he's using your a higher Dimension and so then the question becomes
 how do I introduce hot dimensions of Consciousness into my awareness becomes a fundamental question which I think is how do you how do you do it how do you do it I end end the most fundamentally I would say the way that I attempt to do that in my life is by hearing Bobbitt almond and by hearing similar tax it's it's that the idea that there are there it's not because they're ancient that they're valid sure it's that is because they're valid that their ancient is because they're valid.
pass the test of time you know so many different ways and traditions have have the same wisdom in different packages some of them may be expounding on it more and more detail than others but everybody we can find common elements that have passed through the centuries and so from for myself particularly the tax to be a sativa and those that are following in his footsteps you know text like vomit on text like bug of agita text like my part to my shots is my next question is how does it manifest in your life that's how you get it but we have to do with it likes what he practically do with it that that assist you well the idea is that all you know I read quote quick but you know it was white you I want you I want your heart will pour out your heart to heart
but you know it was actually I think perhaps later in the day whoever this verse now but I think it may relate to something else it will read later in the show today this is bug of agita
 a 1331
 chapter 13 text 3113 3101 a sensible person
 ceases to see different identities do two different material bodies and they see how beings are expanded everywhere they attained to the Brahmin conception retained to the spiritual level of thought or the spiritual level of awareness of the higher dimension of the Brahmin conception and in reading that there's a word here paucity
 property has to see a new pastor t.i. believe that honor means it has you know it can mean several
has an element in it that do the prefix has an element that relates to following reitano Pusha T So proper translate that is one tries to see through Authority
 in other words there are texts that are spoken by
 speakers who were seeing with a higher dimension of Consciousness and if we if we hear from them we can try to see through their vision
 and end in develop a higher level of awareness so how does it work my life if I read these and then you reflect on them and that's the quote that I want if I was actually in a commentary to this might be able to pull it up quick but basically was saying is that it was describing what philosophers called in Sanskrit in Sanford Montana
 which means reflection
Jeopardy sing
 are you frozen again okay thank you are maybe I don't know if I'll be able to pull it up but the idea was Montana is that further shravan are you hear you hear from someone that speaking from a higher level you know how your dimension and then you reflect on it then then as you go through your day you were clicked on it as you pass through your challenges you reflect on it and gradually you you are gifted you you develop the ability to see the same thing that you saw yesterday or last year you said one way you seen the same exact thing but you're seeing it through a new set of eyes
 Auto paucity and and you're able to relate to whatever your circumstances are in a different way and that's the key to growth you know in a general way I would say like
do you have some thoughts on that
 you know what
 not as Lucid as your thoughts
 I've been drinking too much watermelon juice over there what's going on yeah and watermelon juice
 the right I'm a mess Christian. I'm sure both of them gave him satisfied before starting the srimad bhagwat time was the very means a conquest Wichita prospective agencies to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Ryan Ricci the super most human being to other saraswathi the goddess of learning and destroy the velocity of the author not stop her you a show about race Unity Chan Baka Baka Baka by to you too much low-key back to you in about 15 I sticky but regular tennis in classes in the Bog with Tommy by rendering a service to the pure devotees all that is troublesome to the harlo become eradicated and loving service to the supreme law
who is praise the transit of the songs will be established as in a revocable fact my sweetie go to bed, ha I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teacher to open my eyes to the torch setup knowledge I have to rob a since he's at their Lotus feet
 read it for the shoe by baton Canto 7
 4:37 we were we are just beginning this, we thought we would revisit it right but want to go ahead and read a verse about this is the one that had the Krishna Gras the planetary influence in the influence of Christian that's like an influential Planet I've been really thinking about this for fun time this Krishna girl haha it's because the planets have a poll on us in a full moon or New Moon the Moon phase has a hole
on the body and of course if your dominated by a particular Planet you your astrological chart you know these people are very very successful their planets are so powerful and sometimes people have planets that are like man this guy is going to like take his life but it is so the planets the way they lined up and we're responsible because it's our Karma being manifested in front of our eyes but the planets give us some insight to them and they have a weighty Paul either lifting as high or lifting a slower and the Christian for those who are devotees were adding the krishnaraja the Krishna planet has such a strong effect on our Consciousness that is holding us in every direction and we are saying when you add Christian it's your life ever this was one of the film's yesterday was everything becomes auspicious even the most tragic things where they things that seem
the horrible material Material World will claim like unfortunate and horrible they become quite wonderful and so that Krishna graha is is a is a blessing to have that in our life and love in the devotees of Krishna and the aspiring to go do some Krishna that's the bats are deleting Planet more than any other astrological reading astrological Force okay so this is the translation from the very beginning of his childhood prolonged Maharaj was uninterested in childish playthings
 indeed he gave him up all together and remain silent and all being fully absorbed in Krishna Consciousness since his mind was always affected by Krishna Consciousness he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification or like where you and me we're at in our punxsy more like why why are people doing the bank here
well yes you don't think I was like a question with a question what the world has happened what's going on in the world why what why should we move forward half that's been laid out for us that we don't see any real success story start questioning what success in the material world is I think that's the dawn of our spiritual life the way that I understand his Consciousness though I get what you're saying and I agree with that but I think like princess later on we'll hear when he's when he hears people talking about friends and enemies
 I've heard people talk about this thing before but I never really understood how people could see like that it was it's like some kind of deep innocence and Purity that made it very difficult for him to understand how people didn't see
in the same way that he did right
 who's more advanced than us that's I'll give him that that punk rockers and Lower East Side for allowed Mirage has some similarities but okay I stand refuted is the because let's face it there's a lot of people that were like punks Like Us in the Lower East Side and they didn't see the system as a good thing but they just went in a whole different Direction with their Rebellion we we rebelled to God
 and they rebelled towards you know some demons
 there's demons kaszuba interesting stuff lately
you don't put that video is the Buddhist whole thing to it is we're not going to disturb his whole thing to science of mental health Stevens
 I got to do that OK Google that I can respond to them should I would you like me to call since you started the squirrel I was you know in what I'm writing right now a lot of it has to do with
 stages of evolution of Consciousness and wanted in the primary model of that Evolution that I'm working with this is the model from Karma Tu Gana Tu bhakti write the letter evolutionary path is there in
Acro
 they're in the micro natural is beautiful and love is the highest principle and part of it and you know sometimes people when you six press him like that all your Singh bhakti is higher than Gana will that sectarian and but the point that I'm making his know this evolution is found it's it's it's Universal is found in all the different Spirit ditions Branson's in the
 in the Buddhist tradition
 I was reading a I was reading the kind of like an introductory book on Buddhism when Barbie some professor
 and you know generally when like particularly like Western people when we think of Buddhism
 we think of Gianna we sing of Buddhism on the on the platform Abby and we think it has you know everything to do with control of the Mind Control the senses letting go of the things of this world excited looking at that
kind of Yannick conceptions that that level of ganic realization of what the professor was saying that like when you really get into it like if you go to a place like to bat or nay paw
 and you you'll see that primarily the most of the people that are practicing Buddhism
 are we practicing from the level of Karma and the way that he Illustrated that was he was describing how he was sitting I think he was in April maybe two that I think was in Tibet and he was sitting with a you know an influential llama in the area Monk and and they were discussing you know philosophy on the phone with Kiana but he said then a couple you know villagers in a married couple to villagers came in to see the llama and they were
you know reverential towards him but also they were upset you know fearful and they you know he said you won't really know what's the matter and they explained that there been all these inauspicious almonds in their life and they were worried about what they've done what karmic activities are done to bring this upon themselves and so I wanted and you know and his roommate you know he assured them that they have a peaceful mind is there's nothing to worry about and gave them some what you know in Sanford where they would call Price Chitto gave them some rituals to counter off the negative effects that they were worried they were worried I guess you're saying that there's some Demon or something you know something auspicious presence in their life
 so
 there you go get you know you do they do they do Puja they do they do Puja they do mantras to counteract some Spirit some inauspicious things for sure
is very very karmic level anyway approach in and there's all these worship of depth at Taylor's to our let's get into it a lot more rush back to ghosts okay. You're absurd in Krishna Consciousness in the church and Rita it is said a fully Krishna conscious person although situated in this material world does anything but Cristiano anywhere and everywhere interests of the sign of a Maha Bhagavad Gita Krishna everywhere because of his attitude of pure love for Krishna
 as confirmed in the Bronx to meet up Raymond Jenna to read about the election Aina I worshipped us a dive over the issue below Chianti
I want to just do the English Ambassador at Cynthia gonna swarupam govindam ADI purusham Govinda who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love hope it's like a salve in the old days you put some like a salve on your eye or if you have some problems seeing and some are it's a it's a host the host it's an oil that hosts herbs when I try to say sorry
 an oil and you rub it on your eyes so they're saying that oil has to be the Salve of love that's what's keeping us from seeing Krishna face-to-face and that's a tall order it sounds like well I know I love you and I love people but we get challenged a lot
easy to love the people that are similar to that like us that look up to us but when there's people that are out there on the other political side or your people that aren't behaving what I how I approve or people that just don't think I'm cool or validate me it's like it's hard to love them and so we are in a constant practice of learning how to love these people who are just not acting in a way that attract love and I think especially this is Same Love for Govinda and then through that you developed the kind of
 right so I'm saying dance of loves and you're discussing on you yes yes
 exalted devotee exalted devotee or Mahatma write a great soul to be seen remains fully conscious of Krishna and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his heart it is sometimes said that when one is influenced by
Little Stars Saturn Saturn rahu or K2 you cannot make advancements in any prospective activity will you and I are both in our Saturn. Yeah but we have a very strong Saturn. It's not an inauspicious Saturn but it is a time of shedding shedding material things you shutting yeah
 simplifying we got a shed like Gus said there's a lesson to be learned from my dog just the opposite way of providing Mirage was influenced by Krishna the Supreme plan unless he could not think of material world and live without Krishna Consciousness that is the sign of a Maha bhagavat even if one is an enemy of Krishna in my bag about sees him to be also engaged in in Krishna service another critic sample is that everything
a yellow to the jaundiced eye similarly to a Maybach about everyone but himself appears to be engaging Christmas service that's a fascinating perspective and I try to understand it I don't feel I understand it very well but I assume
 that that perspective at least part of that understanding has to do with a very zoomed out perspective right like even all the activities that in other words if we we would look at people and judge them and say they're definitely not engage in Christian service but this person whatever it is that we are whatever information were using to come to that conclusion
 to the Maha bhagavat to the devotee this great ability those things must be very insignificant in comparison to other information that there a tune to you know sure
 yeah
Sound of Silence
 okay is the approve Maha bhagavat the Supreme devotee in the previous verse it is stated that he he had natural
 attachment the symptoms of such natural attachment for Krishna described in this verse although provide Mirage was only a boy he had no interest in it in playing estate in the bottom of the symptoms of the perfect Krishna Consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities for small boy to try to give up playing it's impossible a prolonged Mirage being situated in class devotional service was always absorbed in trance the Krishna Consciousness just as materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material game in my bag of Life prolonged Mirage is always absorbed and thoughts of Krishna
nice I hope you got to try to bring that planet into our life
 in so many ways
 might enjoy that pina colada thing their thoughts of Krishna Das being always embraced by the Lord
 he did not know how is bodily Necessities such as sitting walking he's eating lying down drinking and talking we're being automatically perform so he's really out here yeah he was he was really
 in another level of Consciousness where he was just in town early dependent
 and just free
 check report this we could it's a quick one small child well-being
for by his mother does not know how the needs of the Body for eating sleeping lying down
 passing water and evacuating are being fulfilled is simply satisfied to be on the lap of his mother-in-law really grow out of Mirage looks exactly like a small child being cared for by Govinda
 that necessary the necessary activities of his body were performed without his knowledge as a father and mother care for the child Govinda cared for provide Mirage who remained always absorbed in thoughts of Govinda
 this is Krishna Consciousness prologue Mirage is the Vivid example of perfect Krishna consciousness
 Mara is not helping me and I'm blaming or what is going on is living your Beach life over here
upper I need to help I need you to help me right now
 you also need to stop nursing that pina colada drink it's ruined the time is up East bugs come out right now and I'm scared because of advancement Krishna Consciousness he sometimes cries sometimes wow sometimes Express Jubilation and sometimes sang wildly sometimes upon seeing the Supreme personality of God had provided Mirage loudly call in full and call and phones ID
 he sometimes lost his shyness and Jubilation and begin dancing and ecstasy and sometimes being fully absorbed and thoughts of Krishna he felt the one that she felt the Oneness and imitated the Past Times the Lord okay let's let's let's discuss this just a bit we're hearing about someone that sounded an extremely high
level of body Consciousness Krishna Consciousness very high level of spiritual awareness and these are involuntary symptoms that that play out in him right ecstasies in the commentary
 regarding said he felt Oneness his property rights these feelings of a devotee would not be appreciated by in personalist so impersonal is here means those whose faith is not that the absolute truth is supreme manifesting in a personal form their ideas that in truth there is no form that any conception of form even of the Gods of the goddesses or Krishna is illusion and has to ultimately be pronounced to to rise to the higher levels of awareness so the feelings that provide is having here dancing and jubilation
feeling all these different Deep Emotions probably saying these feelings of a devotee would not be appreciated by a person list one must go up and I promise it is one must go further and further into spiritual understanding
 the first realization is impersonal Brahman
 okay so that and we can discuss what that means but promises but one must still go further to realize part of Mama and eventually the Supreme personality got it so three levels of awareness are we allowed to ask describing higher dimensions of Consciousness and Sage is like biassed wrote that these are higher and higher stages of consciousness of awareness of God of the Divine
 so probably says one must go further further the first realization is in personal Brahman
but one must go still further to realize part of Mama and eventually the Supreme personality of godhead who was worshipped by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of Shanta. Sia Sia. Sawyer for metro area
 so you know this is something that I've been on how is that being a cloudy day good
 who is it was like
 so
 I thought maybe we can talk about it very briefly least three different levels of awareness or three different levels of realization of the absolute right what do you say if somebody says something like came out to me I don't believe in the god I believe like the ocean is God I believe like the sunset is God I believe that the Grand Canyon is God can you say that Ramon
realization
 well
 it probably doesn't rise up to what what would Johnny Be categorized as Brahman realization but it can be related to that right it's an impersonal way of saying the power of the material universe
 it's a greater energy than me or I am I am that energy you know I am the mountain and I am the river and you cuz I am cuz Saga called me dumb drama everything is just rum and everything is at 1 energy it probably that was the bait for a lot of us because a lot of us out of our Western judeo Christian background because we don't like the relationship with God God became sort of cruel or God became an authoritarian figure and we heard this concept of
you are God and the East they talked about you know mindfulness and that we are all God and then that there's not some goddamn out there and even though we don't necessarily believe that
 we believe that God is out there and got his also we are also part of God in there but it was sort of got cut and it was sort of like a bait to sort of like bring us to higher forms of Consciousness for a lot of people for sure and you know anyone could say that the the thesis is that I'm completely different from God
 and that would be like the judeo-christian thing right God is great I'm small that's it that's final and then the antithesis of that is like all is one I am God and everything is God you know that the thesis is nothing but God is God and the antithesis of that if you if you're if you're not happy with that presentation the antithesis of that is everything is God or
God is everywhere I am God to you know we are all got any distinction any difference is illusion in a must be rejected and in order to rise to level truth I really think it's a good thing we got the good angle here yesterday because we're here and go other a lot of a lot of our like nothing person's laundry people person so I said what your name is said Simon so your name is Simon
 he said yeah I said really my name is Roxanne. He's like I said he said I said what he said what is rakanoth mean I said is Boggle on he's like there is there's only one bug one I said I agree you should probably find it in your heart I go yeah I just called in your heart is called
he was no no no I said yeah bhagwan in the hardest part about when he goes no no no Hindus believe 33 million demigods and I said yeah they're Davis Davis & Davis but there is one
 there is why they let you Deva there is one day but you gave up that is the one I was taking them down here you should have got that for your Instagram thing I would love to seen that posted you guys should have done so in case I was saying that
 that there's a the thesis witches there's goddess everything is separate and different and lesser than God that's in that would be the judeo Christian idea and then the antithesis of that is no there is only God and we are all that God and that's all they're even see how he must have drove Christians crazy
Bryce strong crazy but what's so so what the the body of his belief and it's super well-articulated it at by the followers is that we are one and we're different it's a synthesis right there's a Oneness and there's a difference you know it's it's bit more nuanced than that it's not one or the other end and try to understand that so like this is something we shared on the show before if you if you're if you're trying to explain your faith in bhakti
 two people that are new to it and they ask for what you believe about God and you just start off on the Bhagavad level but I believe God is a blue coward boy that lifts covered on hill and that for the for the ninety-nine percent of the people out there that is just going to sound absurd and irrational and ridiculous just like some really blind faith that you have
you say that you don't following that these ancient teachings you coming down from the sacred text
 what they described is God manifesting in three different ways one is as it is as though you know these little baby Krishna Krishna as a five year old that is it talking about it, and then as a prince the one all-pervasive Divine Light that is that substratum of sure of it every of everything and then there's the localized form of God that is present within the heart of every living being
 and then there's actually the person God actually that you could know God in a in a personal sense with form and so on and have a personal relationship with just that is enough to make the average
say oh oh okay you know so you can approach that was so briefly you know something about these three different levels of a realization you're starting with Brahman realization so yeah it starts when one's is starting to perceive that everything in material nature is temporary and so they begin to seek that which is eternal
 and through reflection on that into deep contemplation on that it through meditation and you know usually they'll be practices of renunciation of letting go of the things of this world one begins to perceive that eat their own eternality and how they are one with the Eternal Grumman that the Eternal substratum of of all of this and what the feel inside is like I've bandaged my temporary identities right
I'm not this manner this woman or you know I am beyond all that I am from and I am part of that energy and that I'm Eternal and and I am Eternal of blissful Consciousness and there's nothing in this world for me to lament about or to desire you know because I am infinite and and in a sense I'm one with the Universe I made of the the energy of the universe if you call that Brahman realization and will send it said that that is the that's you know that we said ultimately the Supreme the Divine God is such it on Monday eternal
 full of knowledge for the Bliss this is realization of the eternality the Eternal aspect of the Divine
 and then progressively not as you move forward as you have probably seen you have to go deeper have to go move forward one begins to recognize that there's an order in this world that we're living it and it it has to be design
has to be controlled by a conscious being who's overseeing everything and keeping the order and this is the chit level right that the knowledge level so on this level of realization in Muskegon is talking about that part of mama was in the heart of every living being one feels within my own heart I'm in constant contact with this that make contact with and you can say I'm under the shelter of right this Transcendent all-pervading powder Brahmin this hire personal manifestation of of Eternal Bliss full and that this supreme conscious
 being the sole of the entire universe who exists outside and inside of everything and whoever sees and controls all the material energy
 is a dear friend of every living being and I've got
right here my heart and I exist in his network of material energy which he's providing with his Consciousness and
 controlling and dim in an organizing and it maintains I live in his
 you know it in his expansive Network he friended you also the one running the Instagram allows you to have your your own pages is all of that yet that there is a master
 you know behind her the webmaster is a mastermind at all and so then you know that's when still got the highest level of evolution
we're going to Beyond both prominent part you can sit including Grumman in Parma and then evolving still further when one hears about
 this part of Brahman
 and they realize that this Parliament has its own Bliss you know that it derives through its own activities and it's on you no loving Adventures of supreme Bliss
 it's either in that you only get like hearing you know and you only realized by hearing from someone who's realized it then what's your feeling inside now is I am krishna's what prophet wrote about it in the comments are here right he's going to get it. Don't you also get it by all the nine stages of bhakti
 and there's that there's an example of an Exemplar for S10 no doubt no doubt but even all of that is your attraction to that is coming through some purse
right that's sharing of Mahabharata but yes I'm going to vote and dumb but he said I want to go to the the end of what I read There He said
 he said one was still go further to realize part of Mama and eventually the Supreme personality about it which means by Gabon who is worshipped by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of Shanta. Sasaki about cellular material what does one feel that we mentioned him with Brahmin realizations one's feeling I'm Eternal and Blissful I'm infinite I'm one with the universe and a mama they're experiencing these ideas of I'm connected I have in my heart within me and end with out me the presence of this Divine being this year most friend who's controlling everything
 on that bucket
rotation the inner feeling is I am in in this relates to the the words are probably was using a shunt to me and Shanta is like
 these are five different varieties of love that one can have her got shunted me so I guess there's no service it's more like an appreciative love you know it's a 10 inactive love. She means I love you like a servant like you like you're my Superior right sometimes like people love their teacher
 you know or less a there Guru or something like that you know somebody got to them in such a deep way I kind of want to ROM yeah and I want to please you I want to serve you that's with that kind of love and suck your means intimate friendship knowing that you love buddy love is not my Superior that I love but it's like my equal that I love and Visalia is more like a protected parental love her I'd like actually the object to my
