 I got a big keishin
 alrighty then alrighty will it it said take the Sun to the Nugget now. My phone's been confiscated by Miss Mara from GK chesterson to catch St Louis
we call him before in the show have we yeah I know at least once cuz this name is so funny name of it so they can eat here named like this don't forget it to puff and stuff but I just like Google it right now cuz he was like this acid trip of a character like when we were growing up I don't even know who he is now brother crazy bastard strip of a kid show it's not $5 he was at an English writer or philosopher a Christian apologist
 and a literary and art critic and he looks exactly like you would expect him to
play h.r. pufnstuf he's got those glasses that have no
 you don't know why arm Cinema whatever no beer but it's very sick mustache the end now but a big fluffy curly hair kind of thing but not white and some type of Derby weed tweet outfit cuz we got to get focused today I want you to read all the thousands of faces listening to us and just like talk to you see that's that's a good thing though usually you cut me out and you just talk about it
 so let's read the Nugget recognize let's get focused
okay it isn't that they can't see the solution
 it's that they can't see the problem interesting to me that could read that again it isn't that they can't see the solution
 it is that they can't see the problem because his great it's it it's like we live in a world fixing symptoms that we don't understand often times in the fixing of the symptoms we cause more problems right because they're not getting it to the root the heart that the root of the disease just because the the check engine light is going on that's not the problem though that light blinking that's not a good light to Blink I should get a screwdriver and pound that light off goes on the car breaks down you know that that's a symptom that's a warning sign that's a good thing
write acid indigestion you don't try to get rid of acid indigestion taking Tums you find out what am I what am I eating that's giving me acid indigestion or maybe you don't have a healthy gut maybe that's the baby no gut Flora maybe that's it maybe I'm compounding undigested food on top of undigested food maybe they have been drinking too much liquids with my meal you know any bad food combining could have been too much silk nog over the holidays Justin okay let's continue with this people get the analogy, only what you do for that flies in the fish happy let's get it you know a cigar I love you that'll make you happy
analogy
 honestly we may be someone could look that up for his marriage maybe you could search origin of the fish out of water and knowledge and then you take a fish and you take it out of water and you give it anything anything wonderful nicest thing you can give a fish out of water how you can put it on a silk LOL it would probably like that A little maybe another fish be back maybe give it another fish right maybe take it to him or sold in a sports car maybe take it out to a restaurant typhoon whatever you want money no matter what you do no matter if you hold the fish you stroked the fish and the fish still isn't happy
 even if you're
 give this fish it's not that you can't see the solution that's not the issue here yeah it's like the fish just won't be happy you can give it a Cuban
cigar
 it's not going to be happy until you put it back in the water why cuz that's where it belongs that's what the problem is that was the one trying to find happiness in a material world that's the problem it needs to read and that's why we can get together you know driving I'm looking for a pack of cheap they drove through 3 hours plus to come here yesterday to do what to sit on the floor right to sit on the floor and sing songs to come on get a life that's the life you come together with people or strictly focused and you sit and stew the most simple of simple things we're trying to get all these extravagant things
 please
 so we were reading yesterday about how our demands that listen to check about you.
 Express
get back to at least the 14th century and it was in the prologue to the Canterbury Tales
 Canterbury Tales
 it's amazing your profile was also besides everything else probably it is very agitated
 re-educated
 is he was
 were you saying are you sure you run out of energy and maybe run a few laps around the house and
 I was saying yesterday we were reading about how our desires drive us to pursue pleasure
 and we pursued and so many different like you were saying so many different varieties of ways so many ridiculous way is really ridiculous but the results were still not happy we're still not satisfied we still haven't found peace we still haven't found contentment we still feel something
missing something's lacking it's not that we got to keep searching harder for the solution
 is that we have to just understand what the problem is
 we're a fish out of the water it wouldn't go with reading yesterday was saying that the illusion that we are disconnected
 from our source from the root of all of this that that there is
 there is on something that ties everything together and when you get deeper into the confidentiality of the time you find someone
 and when we act when we act in say blindness of that particular Wellness done with enthusiasm then it doesn't matter what material adjustment that we make we can keep going on and I we can get creative we can spend money it doesn't satisfy we've got to try to to understand what's the root cause of the problem
that's a lot of what it's doing is it's on it's it's it's helping on helping us understand that helping us see everything and everyone
 as tied together as all connected but all connected to one Central Point and then you can we move in harmony around at Central Point you know then then then we're solving a problem then then it doesn't matter like that you're saying I drove for three hours and I just sat on the floor and sing some songs you know what a waste of time what my abs don't know you find happiness right there because you're moving in harmony with at Central Point right that Central person so any when the event doesn't show ended up itself and you got a car ride home and you're talking about things and you're you're appreciating things you know it is a triggers conversation and thoughtfulness noticed a can also
also miss this whole thing Christian is very
 he's hard to catch with just your mind and intelligence we can get natural symptoms like you know what this material world is too much I have cluttered up my life I have too much junk in my life and so we could be
 feeling like this doesn't feel right like the fish does not feel right out of water so we can get this intuition also if something's not right which is a beautiful natural healthy intuition for intuitive person and then we can say that what I just created a complicated life I'm going to uncomplicate all this guy's traffic is going to cut him out of my life all this stuff I'm going to renounce so much water in my life I'm going to live simply and I'm going to live just a more connected life maybe get a garden and move out of the city or something like that but but the point is is that unless that's got a spiritual connection
just
 just shaving down my clutter is also not going to fulfill me as well you could also still be a fish out of water in a renowned sweat as well if you're not see a shin isn't that the real problem isn't that we're not renounced like the real problem is that we're not connected yes yes yeah
 if if you if you read Bhagavad Gita you're going to see Chris the same connect to me right you looked at you you look that you don't be connected to me always he's not going to say renounce everything and then everything is going to be good no sync connect reconnect
 okay

 She's got power we're going to shoot

 alright let's dive in where we left off
 was that a promise was made by Lord Vishnu
 to educate tomorrow you'll for instruction from Lord Vishnu and then ended it
 trying to find it
 you're here
 assistant now
 I'm lost. He said this this is the last person we read okay if you accept this conclusion of mine and that conclusion was how everything's working under his Direction how to reconnect with him in through reconnecting with him through Divine Law
this way this is what it says if you accept this conclusion mind being on attached to material enjoyment adhering to me
 with great face and that's becoming proficient in fully aware of knowledge and its practical application of life you will achieve the highest Perfection by tainting me to be fully connected again now we're going to eat now we're going to see just how proficient can treat your K2 became because he's going to be put through a test and he's going to handle it like a pro bass pro fishing
 after offering a basin cease to the direction from which ananta the Supreme personality of God that it disappeared chitra K to write to just disappear and that you toast standing there
you began traveling in outer space
 as the head of the big e r s oh yeah he's put in the position of head of this species of higher beings right. Our info do Catholics did your daughters daughters literally means knowledge or caring wisdom in the Hindu epics. Ours are described as essentially spirits of the air they described as doing different activities in the Epix like gazing at the human problems with astonishment string flowers
 watching a combats Rejoice because it here like many times you hear them mentioned in relation to another event right like all the battle goes on and then the visit hours like they throw flowers or something yeah. I don't think what they're all about but
just like Mara and like it's not like everybody in Earth nits but Marin it's occasionally you know
 so they drop flowers from the sky they blow bugles or something like that that's great magical powers and abilities to debility to diminish their size
 they are endowed with epithets describing them as doors of good and devoted to Joy they also they live on the gun the month at Mountain and other Emily and mountains with the canaras
 there I think the numbers of some kind of bird species aren't they know that's my wrong about that Karina says yes and defeated by a 10-year old
 yeah some kind of burden and are there also described is resigning on Mount Kuro Chou on chitrakoot where rahmsauce are women playing and in the Hills
and they're all they're all over the place there to describe throughout these texts okay but there's some kind of a Celestial lover and musician half human and other half horse or half-bird half-human they're always half-human I wonder what part of the half
 we don't know how are they the Horsehead
 and the human body or is it a horse legs and a human head or is it straight down the middle
 text one of these things though okay text 223 being praised by the great sages and Saints and by the inhabitants of Sid holowka and Charnel Oka chitra K to be the most powerful Mystic Yogi
wandered about enjoying life from millions of years
 with bodily strength and sense is free from deterioration he traveled with in The Valleys of sumaira mountain which is the place of perfection for various kinds of Mystic power in those valleys he enjoy life with the women of the Vdara Loca by chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord Harry
 what time will King chitrakadi was traveling in outer space on a brilliantly effulgence airplane given to him by Lord Vishnu he saw Lord Shiva surrounded by citizen Char Ennis
 cycle oil otherworldly scene going on right here it is I think they're like super Yogi's
 charna's is flying through outer space look up star with a charm Hazard thus it is with a perfected beings a chart they're all these higher higher Planet beings with me
take a look at charnas
 Lord Shiva was sitting in an assembly of great saintly persons and embracing parbattie have a slap with his arm shoot 4K to laugh loudly and spoke with in the hearing of Parvati so this is where everything starts with a sprayer it all falls apart inappropriate things said to Lord Shiva I mean you know there's a lot set of what let's hear what he says and then we can talk about it but this is unusual
 here you have Lord Shiva who's like an important spiritual figure any this isn't like he's in some quiet secluded Place embracing Parvati he's kind of like in like in a traditional setting where you speak about you know where you have elevated spiritual conversation you don't expect them to have their wife sitting on their lap when are you thinking in that way so it was unusual
and he saw it but let's see what he says and then we can talk a bit more about it
 Lord Shiva the spiritual Master of the general populace is the best of all living entities who have accepted material bodies he enunciates the system of Dharma yet how wonderful it is that he is embracing his wife Parvati in the midst of an assembly of great the saintly persons when he's as wonderful as being a little it means fantastic it makes me wonder why I wonder how this is possible that he's doing this right because I'm saying members of the opposite sex on your lap publicly
 yes if they specially in that kind of setting is it was very unusual but not the kind of person that can do on usual things right for sure he's above the rules are as lab don't be awkward you know but
Parvati and Shiva make it a pass they got a pass on it
 ordinary person except Lord Shiva whose hair is matted on his head has certainly undergone great austerity is in penances she's going to glorify him indeed he is the president in the Assembly of strict followers are very principles none the less you see that with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her as if he were Shameless ordinary human being I don't know what to make of this like I have so much respect for him I'm a little concerned
 at this will bring some kind of unfortunate results there's a commentary on this from Chula Vista cannot chakrabarty Tok or he remarks that although chitra K to criticize Lord Shiva
how to find Lord Shiva like daksha did
 Doc should consider lordship insignificant by chitra K to express his Wonder at lordship is being situated in that way so remember if we go back to 4 schedule
 that's awesome
 figure daksha Porton figured out you didn't think all the lordship is so great how is he doing is he just said how is he doing this like who is this got you know who choose who is very different he really appreciates what Shiva and he's a little concerned that this isn't a good thing because people might misunderstand him and he doesn't want that in one sense he's criticizing
 but in another sense is coming from a really good place it's not coming from a place of it is because if it wasn't someone that he respected so much he wouldn't have maybe even said anything
but because
 he has so much respect for both Parvati and Lord Shiva he spoke up and said something
 it's one of these things that it's sometimes hard for an American get to get in their mind and until recently liked very recently that the whole idea of public affection
 it's just not it it's just it's just not done it what at least it wasn't done for so long and India now it's I think it's at this changing a little cuz of medium stuff like that but it's almost like shocking to see it in India it's just a culture where that doesn't it in America has its base that you kissed somebody in the street you know you hold your hands in the Street YouTube racing in the street it's just it's just not there I remember we had had what I had a pilgrimage once I had a very nice couple who are newlyweds are like the other I think they're it was a Kim told me for the nicest couple verse spiritual couple and we're at the Ganges was beautiful during this whole lamp offering and the whole thing once
it's romantic kissing but it was it was like they didn't do anything wrong in their heart I felt but yeah it was just like publicly people don't get it like what are they doing here
 168
 the pilgrimage leader takes him a car mount for everything I felt it for myself or persons generally Embrace their wives and enjoy their company in a solitary Place how wonderful it is that Lord Mahadev although a great master of austerity is embracing his
openly in the midst of an assembly of great Saints get he's not your like criticizing it's just like sorta overly questioning perhaps yeah
 in what sense everything that's happening
 and this is one of the lessons is really all in the hands of God do you know he meant no harm Parvati said she's going to come through she speaks of heavy stuff to him she said she was not at all pleased with his comment and what we will see what she does but we're going to see that church of K2 himself he's going to walk away saying I accept everything is like God's plan except it
 he is also like it's not like he wasn't just thinking it he actually said it and he said it out loud so they can hear it
 you know it's a little that's a little hurtful
 if you walked by somebody's I hope nice
that hat you know what I mean
 it's okay to I mean even if you think it
 do you get if you get if you get offense discredits for thinking bad things what do you think I think I in this day and age we don't although like you are like if you're thinking something bad about me
 like if I thought I would let it bad to get karmic reaction for it but at the same time it does create patterns in your minds and that you will lead to probably speaking at or now okay so don't think those I was thinking really nice things about you today
and say it I probably won't get good points for thanking him
 I was going to say go to the bathroom today was thinking today. So now I'm going to say it publicly
 you're a good soldier specials I will get two more points I think you are really good so
 are you just saying that to get points I think you're even better than me
 okay text 9 if you could see your points your security points your pies credit voice
 HEX number 9 x 9
 I'm really low on points
 Sheila's us while we continued
 my dear King
after hearing chitra K2 statement Lord Shiva the most powerful personality whose knowledge of Fabolous simply smiled and remain silent and all the members of the assembly followed assembly follow the Lord by not saying anything when he's not cool head of these knuckleheaded but she's pretty cool
 and everybody's following suit all these Sages
 who is a
 mother's charnas here we still have Mary did you ever find out who the charnas are
 nothing didn't come up
 how hard did you try Mira
 Isabella right age to car
smokers Mirage would not let her off the hook not at all did you look are you tell me know what I mean and Kashmir
 as mentioned in the knee LaMotta piranha singers from Kashmir
 maybe the Kashmir singers are named after light yeah yeah that's what it sounds like
 the musical
 the musical beings pretty cool that that's what your race is known as the music a species and if you think about it will be no Pirates have parrots are like the talk and species
 monkeys are the mischievous in a playful and species is another way of looking at it is statements
not at all pleasing right they weren't pleasing and therefore the goddess Parvati being very angry spoke as follows to chitra K to the thought himself better than Lord Shiva and controlling a census
 that's a problem when you start to control your senses right you start to see other people who might not even have a lot of body but not actually controlling your sense as well
 yeah and you might be like better who do you who do you think you are you can't even control your senses very prone to that kind of Pride yeah
 text 12 horsepower text 1150 speaking received a post from which you punish Shameless persons like us how the addition of sarcasm has he been appointed ruler carrier of the rod of punishment now the only master of everything that's basically
play like who do you think you are I know you're you're higher than they were chilling now. Now you plan on you got an airplane from Lord Vishnu and now you're like
 yeah I am your private jet from Lord Vishnu continue a few forces here in Alaska who is taking his birth from the lotus flower does not know the principles of Dharma nor do the great Saints like briggle & Narda nor the four Kumar's had to buy snot kumara Monica P level also forgotten their Dharma the religious principles I suppose it to be because of this that they have not tried to stop Lord Shiva from behaving so improperly who took his he doesn't know what he's talking about you no more than him and Bri Boo and Arda and sanat kumara and Monica. They've all it did we can't go to them anymore you're the authority now huh
that's how things work in the universe
 I want to be famous with a whoopsie defend the mother District a 2 is the lowest of treachery has free is infinitely overridden overridden Vermont and the other demigods by insulting Lord Shiva upon whose load of speed they always meditate Lord Shiva is the is personified Dharma & the spiritual Master of the entire world and therefore should your case you must be punished
 this must be getting scary
 this person is puffed up because of his achievements thinking I am the best he does not deserve to approach the shelter of Lord vishnu's Lotus feet which are worshipped by all saintly persons for his impudence they gave himself greatly important
so if you didn't want my dear son now take birth in a low simple family of demons so that you will not commit such an offense again for the exalted saintly persons in this world oh now there's there's the curse is that is curse at all that link it just connected right there I click that how he became Fortress or that's who richest or was virtuous or was his crate of OT came to educate two who had gone through already gone through
 gone into his deep meditations learned every lesson I had to learn you know anyone that he said his back to life is baby came back to life spoke to him today just spoke to him already gave in the meditation on the Vishnu we meditate on their vision of a solid which no we offered prayers or visual. Visual gave him benedictions
 and then one day he was flying around and he said something you know it in this is the thing he's good we're going to see how
what are you talkin about I didn't even mean anything wrong by this
 I'm not disrespecting with you I love Lord Shiva and Who You'd to go and start cursing me for this interview take birth in a family of demons I mean is that fair is that right you know you're going to do that to me when I wasn't trying to do anything wrong at all he doesn't respond like that at all in this is a serious thing is it's especially as devotees and sacred circles they got to be careful what comes out of the mouth and you know what
 people like me suffer from this and know I I just talk I just talk talk talk talk ever noticed that sometimes I can just really just talk and brake lever insightful and funny it's stupid comes out of an opportune time
I don't know where he don't talk about why you say yes so quick LOL
 do you have a terrier so the curse just came down
 let us continue this
 Teresa gets 17 should be able to send it from his airplane bad before her with great humility and pleased her completely that's how you take a curse one and I don't know LOL tell you you told me let me tell you about down about it you know we started the bottom four years ago
 right or Leon
 it's for her anyways its license course it's for
44123 it's like accounting so we started it early on we heard his story
 about King Cricket right who's the questioner in the Stream of Bob and Tom
 and he one day he was out hiking you know he was exhausted he was hot he was tired he was wiped out he was kind of in a state of mind like you normally wouldn't be in
 as always he's very respectful right very respectful to the to the sages to the Saudis to to the yogis and he came across one he came he came up to his
 I'm going to ride over here I really am exactly like four more years to Inwood Road for more years on the chat but Timothy tacos right now
okay so so when when I March break it all wiped out and dehydrated and kind of like a little bit
 little bit
 maybe he was just like a little bit losing it you know so he found one stage in his little ashram and he said you know you're saying has the stage name is Shamika Russia you say pretty please help me in can you provide for me some water to drink but the sage was in such a deep state of meditation samadhi
 he didn't even understand that anyone was speaking to him
 and so Mars Prickett he didn't get that in the state that he was in any he was a little disappointed that this that this stage
 would even talk to him
 and so he said all okay you're just like that and there was a dead snake right nearby
and he took the bow his bow and you looked at the stake any wrapped around his the stages neck like it was a Garland
 he would normally do something like that right we all have our days and that was her bad days all days for playing around with dead reptiles we've all been there so then he returned home
 and unbeknownst to him at the time the son of that Sage same as shrini
 he he he found out about this and he was a Mystic the young Mystic this young Mystic and this is a really important lesson to learn
 this young Mystic
 he had the power of a Mystic
 but he didn't have the full culture of a saw do you know and so that power becomes dangerous in the hands of someone that doesn't quite have the grounding
you know exactly how to use and how to apply it so he cursed Mars Bruno Mars. He was a king
 that was he was supporting Everyone by his strength and by his power and by his Dharma he was giving shelter to an entire Kingdom he made a small offense any cursed Mara spricket to die in 7 days it was a total of a reaction it was something someone that had missed apartment that had the grounding of a real sourdough what is maybe wouldn't talk to him or something like that excuse me you're the king we were suspect you were grateful to you but you understand that what you did was inappropriate can we talk about that you know something that would have been more appropriate but it was it was way too much but they can't accept it right the king accepted it
 he actually do you know I just
just the other day let me see if I can pull this up I found them I found something about exactly what I didn't know is going to get into this if I did I would have brought this up earlier but let me see if I can find it there's a phrase that he used
 I hope I can find it
 ya got it
 I think I got it
 although King Huracan poetically describe the brahmins curse
 as a cause of fear the truth was that when he learned of the curse he was unafraid and even pleased
 it was pleased by the curse he was already hoping for such a reaction to his offense like I know I did something wrong let's get this offense that let me pay the price right does he
says here
 you know cuz I don't have the
 because I don't have the the diacritics are all messed up in the way I copied and pasted but he said something like Martha Priya priyatama I took it as most welcome I welcome the curse
 and so let's see chaquetas response here or seeing a similar thing you know cricket by his Chris he lost his position as king
 Choo Choo Ka Choo by his curse is going to lose his position as king of the Vida dhara's to very high-level positions that come with lots of prestige lots of power of Fame lots of perks but both of them Let It Go like that now we're seeing throughout the Bob with Tom injury
 just not able to let go ride like scheming play
I'm putting himself in all kind of
 typical positions in an embarrassing positions
 just to try to maintain his his position right that's that's ignorance right we're seeing it we're seeing are like a a contrast you know there's another there's another time and we read this back in the fourth Canto where if you remember can print two who was like this up-and-coming incredibly powerful and righteous he was doing all kind of rituals including the horse Rejuvenation ritual right
 and he done 99 and was about to do another do 100 but in your head done 100 he kind of set the record
 and he was afraid that if this King pretty does 100
 he may take over my position he may get so much
good karmic you know Merit from that that he missed he may become the next injury may bump me off and so he he did this crazy thing where he disguised himself as a senior see and he stole the horse and took off and got caught and got brought back and embarrassed in front of everyone total humiliation
 and then he went into the exact same thing again I got caught a Kick In The Head relay to Indra it's like a total it is almost straight out of like I said, and then and then when you been captured the second time you know he's kind of bound and he's in front of Lord and he's in front of King pretty too and he's in King creatures wandering you know what should I do on one hand he's done something very wrong and it's a king is my duty to correct what's wrong on the other hand he's in Georgia you know he's meant to be
expected but he's acting in such an an undone respectable wag so so what do we do about this you know and
 and Lord for my steps up and speaks to him and he gives in this instruction that is like so deep in this is this going to be a big takeaway for today you know like what we walk away with
 he said to him, take my words with great respect
 what a good way to start right, take us up for a beginner I said do not be agitated or anxious because your rituals have not been properly executed do the providential impediments right the world did move your way
 he said don't don't Focus your anger this person see it as a broader thing right see it as the world is not moving with the way exactly one it's right now and they said, take my words with great respect we should always remember
that if something happens by providential Arrangements we should not be very sorry right now very upset about it the more we try to rectify such reversals
