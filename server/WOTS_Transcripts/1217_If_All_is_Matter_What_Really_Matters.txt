 King of Hearts I want to make one announcement today so I'm going to keep in our prayers and I want to talk about
 Uncle Louie
 it was a pocket Louis to you know but just another hardcore Legend albarell you know who albarell right here when I go there yesterday I wrote him and I rode him yesterday
really don't do I know
 surprise around for him love and I love the rail we all he gave us all I gave me for sure he was a champion of straight edge philosophy when I was a teenager when I need when you need it most you know it it really helped me so I gave him I wrote him right before I was going into. I mean he's dealing with cancer he's going through an operation results got so many other ailments back elements he's like kind of bedridden for a long time he was one of these guys who is like the Pinnacle of like vibrant Health as well so at any moment any of us can be just sort of like
 that was forty years ago. Whatever whatever thing is
 yeah. We don't waste a moment and
what is a guy that you know I don't think spirituality Eastern spirit rose ever seen was just start listen to the show and just you know he was open-minded enough to check in every day and here it out it's not like he's in opted-in devotee of Lord Krishna but I think even if you're not you can get there's a lot of wisdom here that's not ours it's not even wisdom is wisdom is for all people suffer any no church has a monopoly or synagogue or ashram or mosque has a monopoly on truth and so truth is for everyone and if there's something if you're new to the shown you're listening to this it might be not exactly your Niche thing take something diable bring it home apply to your life CD for you that's all
 yeah and and you know I just got a message from nunziato from antidote also you said yesterday evening
Louis who's a longtime listener from the very beginning before the podcast was a podcast yesterday evening he was transferred from the hospital to a facility called kindred
 which is in Passaic New Jersey
 350Z Stillen our mistake New Jersey I think so that's all the news this is her for like months now
 yeah the ACT you think you got to talk to her you know but no one always saying yeah send some prayers him some love go visit him
 I'm sad
 may I say something to cheer me up saying that it's going to say something good
 remind me in at noon in the women meet at 2 p.m. today I've been listen to the boxer recovery podcast it's time to get stuff so it's good stuff Gigi's dial then she's deep
okay alright so that's hard answers for the today now listen we're not going to do a nugget today you know we're going to do
 anti nugget and anti nugget is sometimes you need to hear the opposite of a nugget understand right and understand the real nugget this is from
 Stephen Hawking okay me and tie nugget here to reset regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components spell there is no heaven or afterlife for broke down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark
 okay it's time for shelter in defense of reality lyrics huh
well we're looking at this anti nugget this is what I really
 take from this is and it's just something that you know we're looking for truth you know that we're going to do just saying nobody see what did you say nobody's got Monopoly on Truth 77 or wisdom tooth is like math it's for all people out of all time it is it's unchangeable picture in past present future and when I hear some you know I don't just like I got in this case yesterday I don't get a Stephen Hawking's case or anything like that but let's just examine what he's saying is an influential finger but it seems to me sometimes these guys they can they may be very intelligent they may have
 consumed and process so much knowledge but even I just see like the most fundamental like slip-ups in their thinking you know it's like I can think like super powerful in One Direction and then I'm totally
another
 so when he says I regard the brain is computer which hey that's that's a pretty good night we said is we can treat everything as a computer and the brain is really the physical manifestation of the mine just the way that like a like a and we share this before right like a a speaker you know maybe the physical manifestation or like say the next consequential manifestation of like an electric signal right that place since the music into the speaker so is the speaker the source of the music well not exactly do you know it's it's but it but it becomes a cause you know a second
times so we are we're more or less hey we can accept the brain is like a computer and then he's in then he says and when it stops it'll stop working when the components feel fair enough and they says and there's no Heaven or Hell there's no heaven or afterlife for a broken down computer now right there is I called the guy you just totally screwed up your own metaphor here because nobody saying that the brain goes to heaven nobody's saying that the brain has an afterlife we were saying that the brain is like a computer great who is the computer who's the user of the computer that's the point just when my computer breaks down it doesn't mean that I died
 it's Emily when my brain breaks down it doesn't mean that I died you you're giving an argument for the wrong side here and then
you know the buy is come to the kind of the chauvinism where the little bit of arrogance little bit but they giving in to SeaWorld fairytale world not us we Face Reality well that's where the Delta comes in which guy you know if you really want cuz you're so insecure so you have to create this elaborate rituals elaborate Fairytales and worshipping some magical Gods who are resurrecting and going to save you so we just said so that the lyrics go security
 why you talk about security awareness a social security how secure are we staying out your right we actually are insecure and just because you're an atheist that doesn't mean you're more secure We're All in This Together get it right or are we we make our plans in a castle of sand
as our dreams could drag to see you're back to the castle of sand from Jimi Hendrix, it must have been said before people have always been there a million times
 you say you're independent this is a whole that you guys would like to lie on some God you're say you're independent is that a fact it's by Creations donation that you are maintained but you rather turn your back where in defense of reality here we are taking constantly taking from creation yet we are claiming this Independence I don't need God you need God cuz you're so damn dependent insecure have to stick your head in the sand can't face reality reality is and if you don't believe in God how about your just depended on millions of other higher
powers like the sun in the moon in the rain in the key and write the other the water all the elements look at that has God that it's higher than you
 you know where I can. That brings me to my next appointment if you have more lyrics please continue I don't mind your squirrel but it's not a squirrel it's right on point okay then talk it said what was your point is right there say it again or maintain a higher powers are feather a little flute boy you can't imagine that okay how about the higher powers of the son of the reign of the rights of the all the elements that were completely dependent on here here's what I was going to say I saw another clip yesterday Christopher Hitchens
 oh yeah and I mean sorry Mister hitches but you might like mr. Attitude at the exit
you know what the back the problem a little bit of knowledge you just get a little proud I mean I don't think you're arrogant turn it on that pompous as it's like it when they got that British accent they were there really good at you know so they really don't pay Eddie was he says science has explained things that religion used to take credit for for instance he said like there's a germ theory for disease so now we know that diseases are not curse is a revenge is from Heaven and the same thing with earthquakes and this and that and so on but it's like come on guy like this is kind of saying like this like let's say I am
 let's say I went to Rogan us Super Soul farm and I put like an m-80 in his mailbox which is kind of thing people do out in
do you ever do that if you never put an m-80 in somebody's mailbox never even had an m-80 in my life but but let's have put an MA unit like an explosive and in your mail by a flute upright and then like what Christopher Hitchens the saying is like it would be ignorant to say like that was a curse that made that happen you know or that that was like some kind of sign from God or something you know he was so we can we can see what caused it if we can we can we can you know examine the residue left over like from gunpowder in there and so on we can understand it there was an explosive in here that made this blow up looking fine but there was also some one that put the explosive in there and that's something that you don't know anything about how did you know so when you say you know will this disease has nothing to do with God was caused by this germ okay but where did The Germ come from
and that's where you need a theologian and a philosopher to enter in the conversation and in only a scientist that's one of our things right it's a scientist philosopher and theologian if you really want it you know you have to begin to think with different parts of your intelligence different parts of your brain that took approach these important questions and you know when you say something like like Stephen Hawking is saying like the old any sort of an afterlife that's a fairy story for people who are afraid of the dark okay should we go down through history of all the people that were afraid of the dark sure all the all the British people that made discoveries that your discoveries rest on you know they were just afraid of the dark but there's other great thinkers you know throughout history of great things to believe in an afterlife well you're leading right into burst verse to my parent
 today's modern science that's your modern religion okay there you go
right guess what yes work but Todd is fact like when I whenever I teach this stuff you will say well how do you know there's 33 million demigods might answer is I don't know I don't know there's 33 million demigod all I know is this with the basic Authority say I will tell you what I do know that you will tell you what I have a simulated wood I can verify for my own experience but I don't know that but they're very quick to say well this is our Theory I'm going to teach you this fact and they might call it a theory but then they teach it in the educational system they build other theories on top of that theory till today is going to be their very invested in it right today is my vehicle can I build the reputation on it and then it's really hard to hear anything that's all my whole life has been wrong everything that is respected for was wrong
when I read that Christopher Hitchens team
 I saw that clip then I I looked up I went and Googled germ theory for disease okay then it's in the Wikipedia thing and list like different topics and it says the development of germ theory of disease
 yeah you cuz it could sit here Christopher Hitchens speak but it sounds like all just recently people figure out if I like the way a lot of people in a natural medicine will argue with the germ Theory I'm not going to get into that whole thing well
 just hold it right there it is it's a big it is it's a serious issue with naturopaths and people are into cleansing and fasting The Germ Theory cuz they'll save the germs will come to certain bodies of Summer posts and welcomed disease or other people going to be very clean.
faith-based other ideas that that that work in harmony with that theory Sure I was okay but any case under development the very first thing it says it's ancient India
 okay now I got your attention right now it's kind of a couple of ancient Indian rishi's such as conv describe tiny creatures called creamy and there harmful effects in the attire of Aveda say what took me to a link
 of an article written the Forgotten past microbiology of Indian rated knowledge there you go you went down a whole little and this is what I mentioned is there it says in modern age in Modern Age and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek known as father of microbiology was the first person to observe microorganisms with the help of primitive microscopes that he developed
call them and animal animal animal animal animal kills its work was published by the Royal Society of London in the year 1677
 while the discovery of sage scientist conv and other Saints remained on scene within the Sanskrit slokas of Vedic texts
 if we look back to the atar of Aveda thousands of years BC
 we come across three chapters where the description of my microbial world is available I was into this whole thing about 20 years ago serious I'm not saying that that one up here let me saying this stuff is real and the thing is Vedic teachings it's not just like some faith-based idea about God it's it's it's knowledge across the board on health and healing and culture and its Sex Therapy
happy it its longevity all these things are sort of like popular right now you know about you and God and and surrender to God and give up the context of the person who let her hitch in cuz I sent it was just you know quite frankly just speaking with Incredible condescension you know if you are why why I said to if you hear the most learning Vedic philosophers
 we're not just out here to gain intelligence we want to transform character so even as you advance and spiritual life and you will get you will get more intelligence it's the humility of understanding the bar are actually very tiny in this in this universe that shines through these these Vedic leaders he's these gurus these these Masters it's a sweetness that comes with deep connection with the app
real self not just like using some insight or some intelligence to just you know like a peacock parade your you know your greatness around its ugly face ugly ugly so my point was
 that
 the Christopher Hitchens is speaking like well there's two possibilities right you can either be like us who are like people that aren't don't don't buy into the fairy tales who aren't afraid of the dark who are intelligent who engage intelligent who don't have all kinds of unit don't engage in ridiculous stories and someone like that or you can give you a story or you can be religious and just be a complete idiotic fool like that in order to support these
 but is he aware
 that thousands of
Lego
 you know before they're even microscopes there are you know quote on quote him do you know religious men Brahmin is your mom just that that were already like you know centuries and centuries and centuries ahead of the game and that knew about this and started in that we're obviously brilliant and they didn't have a lot of the they didn't have like a lot of advantages theoretically you know that that you're modern-day scientist would have on it so you know maybe just take a step back you know open up to the possibility that they could be intelligent people that see things different than you and really try to understand that rather than just mock them you know really try to understand that and I'm going to take it down a notch
 down to continue on with Shelter lyrics
bring it here and there was a little acoustic
 so it's by okay
 okay so we said today's modern science that your modern religion guesswork taught as fact don't talk back right you're not allowed to even question it a blind faith in their decision so you went blind faith it we as a students of their new religion of materialism we have to have faith in my face is that the right no it's not it's a explosions started creation
 okay and we're just chemical combinations right now but would you take that same Stan if there was a gun in my hand
or would you beg for your salvation to the idea is that all we are his bags of chemicals and why are you so concerned about the bag of chemicals rather threatening first favorite Stein or Ukraine or Russia or like falling in love are giving Christmas gifts for Christmas present to this bag of chemicals over here because everyone can understand that this Consciousness is special right sure and love is real and and there is something wrong when people do horrible horrible things you know when people do loving gestures when people do bold beautiful things I've been Integrity driven things I'm going to I'm going to say this person's wife I'm going to risk my own life that is something wonderful why why why do we want to race that is just so you know what it's all just nothing that's real spiritual bypassing just saying it's all nothing
we got news for you that's what they're teaching your kids in public school
 I like Connie Mae on the chalkboard starless something for this is from Sarah pooter old scientist friend if all is matter
 what really matters
 that's a very Bleak world isn't it thank you need my for pointed out that some more than ever that makes things matter and that's.
 Anyway I'll stop it lyrics but but it is part of his generation everyone thank you thank you
 check that out in your spare time Spotify independence of reality
 all right
 hey Mary Daniel bad for the non hardcore people have to tolerate going through but you know extracted from the bark of a time okay
she bad by what I love these I love these crazy fairy tale stories were telling right and even if you can extract wisdom from there you can extract practical life lessons and let's face it if all your Cult of it they should have knowledge is getting you arrogant we understand that arrogant people can't be happy anyway and in the world of nothingness
 even cares about your philosophy anyway what it what are you even doing just trying to end yourself up to impress people and if you and if your brain is near the continent of the the random combination just came together to do some kind of random explosion
 then why should we trust that as well
 you know where have you guys ever seen an explosion create order
 then happen
does a Dixon teligence a higher intelligence right now did you believe in God before
 where did he work where you at a spiritual person
 yeah you did not that God was a little blue Cowherd boy necessarily but like that there was some greater power that you know some Divine force that was sort of vague you know what the church right now look up Papa Tony where is he at he's been to like Tibet or maybe he was trying to maybe he was like subtly investing that in you yeah he still is I think every morning I think it's part of a
morning meditation practice nice that's a big clue right there I wasn't aware of that at all
 yeah you might have prayed for you in a holy place in India yeah I'm sure he did I'm trying to take credit for your spiritual life but it could be your father since I just take credit for everything
 balakrishna all right we're going to good point in the back of a time these crazy fantasy stories have deep hidden truth is truth unless we're going to be today I'm going to see Lord Vishnu face-to-face perhaps the Rhine on the most good job that I'm chive interrupt them David gas some before we start that she might become witches are very means of conquest or should I perspective the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan reach you this year most you would be
add another starts watching the goddess of learning and destroy the Peosta Dave the author non-stop reggae show about race Unity by regular tents and classes in the Bog become a Veterinary Service in a devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become erratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transmit the songs we established as in a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are a size of a torch light of knowledge I offer around Basin seized after Lotus feet about this one the spiritual master has receded benedictions lesson from the ocean and the spiritual Master is receiving benediction from the ocean of Mercy just as a rain cloud extinguished the blaze in forest fire the spiritual Master extinguishes the blazing fire of material
Spence I offer my obeisances to the Lotus feet of such a spiritual master who was an ocean of auspicious qualities is nice
 all right sorry to put you my bug for Tom Canto 6 chapter 16 text 32 what was just okay to run a quick check back with text 31 and make a little connection here that's what I was going to say to check back with 31 okay so these are the months Rose teacher K2
 yes was given to him by Narda
 so now I know he's done with comes gives you some mantras he chanted and then I'll or division is appeared in front of him and he's experiencing what's going to suck dick Kabob is involuntary ecstatic and expressions like if you were to see the Lord face-to-face all of a sudden certain things will happen
to your body your body
 yet these for gohenry then we can talk to us a bit about some pick up office speaker Baba's as soon as Maharashtra case you saw the Supreme Lord he was cleanse the ball material contamination and situated in his original Krishna Consciousness being completely purified should sounds like when you when you get to this point where you can see the Lord you still there still some contamination perhaps and then as soon as you see him it's like to write maybe that's how it work for him yesterday that this being completely purified now it's kind of like hey we want to use you know Stephen Hawking's thing the brain or the mind is like a computer and all the corrupted files and that's not that he doesn't have a mind anymore but all the corrupted files in that mine are no longer interfering with its Clarity and it was no longer interfering
what happens is is that the nature of the self the true nature of the Soul our set our Eternal knowledge and in in Bliss nature it arose in him and his feelings for Lord Vishnu just overcame him right in the end that's what it says here that he became silent
 for a one-time thing on here is where I'm picking up a destination of the bus or the bus to go to Scranton of this buses going to Scranton why not take the bus you want to go with the Grand Canyon of the Grand Canyon one of the Beautiful Something Scranton's nice but you know what I mean if you want to go to somewhere beautiful in the midst midst the forest and beautiful scenery I want it if you want to choose a life path
 see where these people were living the path I want to be like my day too and if you can compete and if you think that
image of a fantasy guy this is just some crazy story okay there's living Saints or they're saying from a hundred years ago or three hundred years ago that are like historical figures that you can follow in their footsteps how they live or you can follow a life of a person has just given themselves to the material information as no has no spiritual side and is just sort of like the bumbling around the material world I want to see where this bus is going when I when I when I start to find Heroes that I want to consume their information what have you learned from your life lessons you know what I mean I'm going with that I believe I do and I'm hearing about Mars I want to be like that bus
 so then continue with a he became silent in grave
 he became violent and Grave
you become silent became silent and Grave and because of love for the Lord tears fell from his eyes his hair stood on end Goosebumps with great devotion and love you offered respectable of a respectful basins he's on to the original person I have gone had imagined you're seeing the guy face-to-face and burning away all your karma is completely purifying you your hair is like in your arms sticking up and all of a sudden to your start coming and then you start to get grave you start to think about your life but what I've been doing with my life I can't believe the things I was attached to a lot of us have had those already in our life either coming I guess this is it I mean no question but I have a feeling he's going the other direction where is like gray and like I don't like the Lord you know I'm seeing him now
so wonderful and I were sure that's a positive but but but you know and then this septic a baba ride is now that there's no mind interfering with his experience of his own true nature these involuntary unpremeditated expressions are rising directly from his spiritually surcharge Consciousness South Africa Africa music pure ratchet septica means that they are from the transcendental platform they're not symptoms of material emotions not any mind thing going on here they come from the sole proper right this is coming from his true self is this emotion of these feelings that are overpowering him right now physically and it's More Than A Feeling
 text 33
 okay with tears of love and affection
chicha Kate's you repeatedly moisten the resting place of the Supreme Lord's Lotus feet because his voice was choked and ecstasy we hear another second-year this a lot in the past I was like people are just like
 no it's a wonderful version of choking choking General has bad connotations you could ever do sometimes we see when someone is really touched by something and they're trying to speak and they can't speak right choked an ecstasy for considerable time he was unable to utter any of the letters of the alphabet to offer the Lord suitable rare thereafter by controlling his mind with his intelligence and dusk restricting his senses
engagements he recovered suitable words with which to express his feelings right now his composure he began offering prayers to the Lord who is the personification of the Holy scriptures some he does like the Brahma samhita and the Nara. Punch her Opera
 and who is the spiritual master of all
 he offered his prayers as follows as soon as these are his own prayers from his own heart that this isn't what Nora told her he's just speaking now
 that you're here goes my Irish it's okay to show me what is spontaneously and this is something that's not coming through a contaminated mind or confuse my daughter walked miter externally program mine things are coming from from the students at the platform for the we are actually witnessing right now what it's like when a person becomes fully purified when the Lord Pearson face to face
going to come out of his mouth like my second say thank your lord ready we're witnessing work getting up text 34 said conquerable unconquerable Lord although you cannot be conquered by anyone you are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses interests they can keep you under their control because you are caused asleep merciful to the devotees who desire no material profit from you indeed you give yourself to them and because of this you also have full control
 have your devotees okay that's a very deep purse actually because it's speaking about the nature of love and when we speak about Krishna as being like the god of love you and I think when people throw that term around the dressing is the god of love the kind of love is running around before 6
but when we do say there is a god of love we can think of it more like this that his only interest is love in order to love you have to become vulnerable so he begins the verse the very first thing that comes out of your mouth is your unconquerable right like no one can overcome you no one can defeat chapter 4 that prep Prodigy toys I can check
 you are on conquerable but but your conquered by the love of your devotees and they can control you and you know in in in the body rest and reaches into group of Swami this masterful work of body like that that that book was like
 it was like a
 it was a whole new thing you know when it is kind of a shirt in
a whole new era of understanding what about to you is you know the insights of roopa goswami their share their in the Box restaurant to send you and I and he you know he begins by saying that bhakti you know sure but it has certain home or six different symptoms and it's mentioned that one of them is it's the only way to control Krishna write another one is that it's very rare pure devotion very well why is it so rare one of the reasons the reason you know this is the only means to conquer Krishna
 is it true that you want the first reason is that that's a glass one of the other six Hallmark's right but it's okay
 because sooner or later we'll put you on the hot seat
 remember
rare because this
 ten ten ten ten ten well because in order to get it
 all right just tell us everyone see cuz you can only get it from someone that has it okay all right you can't just go out there and get on your own and what's inside that makes it a little hard to find you know you were a heart-to-heart you know not that not that we don't have it but to waken it in us right right it's because guess what if we got bhakti you got it from somebody else somebody planted those seeds in your heart so that's one thing and the second thing is because for one that has peer-to-peer bhakti your love for Krishna Krishna becomes controlled by
aha gazelle how do you get the control Krishna you you have to be so he but this person saying he voluntarily comes under the control becomes conquered by those that love him
 right that's that's that's to say that the illogical to say that I don't think you should find that in another theology so much right thank God that you can conquer God that he becomes vulnerable but this is the god of love try to understand he's the only guy but he's the kind of Love Is God is controlled by love sure I thought that that's who this is and I'm and then it goes on to say and but it in works both ways and did you give yourself to them and because of this you also have full control over your devotees in
goes both ways because when when when when God has this when we feel God's love for us and we become controlled by God's left and this is this is real life right this is real
 hey beautiful hey beautiful it's a love good God to it because of his love for me for little for that
 sheetrock 8 you said 35 number
 Infinite Stratos 34 35 35 35 Cosmic manifestation and its creation maintenance Annihilation are all but your opulence has since lorber Ma and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of you
they're partial power to create does not make them God yushra their consciousness of themselves as separate Lord's is there for merely false Prestige is not valid back to Shelter lyrics do you have a second hand. That's all we are not creating manipulating and leaving the scars robbing from the earth stealing from the trees not out of need but greed and false Prestige and here I think the song about her mama but he's also second in. Everything is second-hand got you can't you can't call my controller but but there's a part of me like like like
and now he's making altars for people by the way if you need to alter you got to reach out to murari frame makes your own all it makes it I can't make anything I build a stone wall recognized but wait a second he didn't create the wood he did not use a second-hand Creator he gets there would be harvested would an ignition makes the wood is a manipulator he carves a wood you're a manipulator sweeper I hate that would make something very beautiful and you call me second hand guards another thing about this verse is now just think
 that this is Tricia K2 why are we even talking about him was because Mars prick was saying the essaouira the demon virtuous or how did he become such a devoted then we went back to his previous life is to educate to right now we're hearing him in church or K2 same
other gods they have no power to create and their consciousness of themselves Lords is there for melee Falls Prestige so when when he's in his next life when he's standing in front of Indra
 he's standing there with this awareness right injure you think that your lord of the heavens and all that you're you're not you know and he injured still have things that he is
 you know Richard sword knows one hundred percent that neither he or intra are are the East Florida it has to end in because of his emotions pure you know I just saw the connection right now I got very good
