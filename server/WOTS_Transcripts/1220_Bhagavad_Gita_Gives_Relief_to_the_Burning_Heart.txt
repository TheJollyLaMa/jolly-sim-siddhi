 famous for Chan in the bhagavad-gita how are you from a wonderful beautiful day I'm excited
talk about going to get to today it's such a satisfying subject matter right now yeah but I see in the background you have road rage and Govinda Priya two of our Zoomers and good friends of ours they made it to my abor so we're looking forward to seeing them in India when we come without any further adue do you like to introduce a bill to and who is someone that we brought on her show quite a few times
 for me there's no one that I can think of more appropriate to bring on the show then on this day and by Shay Shay comfortable because for me he's like a living walking representative of bug of agita you know he he knows it backward and forward he he's he's deeply invited into his life and he just kind of his his like a
 is is is like a personal bug of agita walking
and I'm not only does he has he does he know it and live it but he distributes it vary widely and one thing we need to discuss his this year the campaign to distribute you know what a thousand thousands he can tell us exactly what the goal is is Thomas 2000's above at least 10 this is a chance for all of our listeners to take part in Napa I want to thank you for coming today welcome to the show
 it's such a pleasure working out for you and everyone
 and I couldn't think of a more appropriate kind of Beyond because as I mentioned before we came on the air
 you and I were together 17 years ago for Akita jayanthi was a memorable time we sat together and recited the whole bug of agita all the 700 versus in one day yeah we are that was at the Broome Street Temple ID
you know where I used to have a Krishna Temple with him there on Broome Street obviously and end on this day we would do a it's a beautiful ritual where you have a you know you have the fire if somehow we managed to do this evening to endure his cigarette like a fire pit and you get the fire going there and with every verse there's an offering of ghee Into the Fire it's a way of our free at 2 to Krishna to Vishnu by you say spa and programs and threw me into the fire and you go through all seven hundred I think the way that we did it was we would go through a whole chapter Channing the Sanskrit
 and then and then we would comment on the whole chapter like give us summary of it then having you there with was great for that too it was a joint my wife and I still talk about you know you stayed with us in our apartment for a few days at that time and you are so thoughtful and Inns in so many ways
and it said such as probably inspired by the environment I never been in a cleaner more spiritually surcharge environment in my life and suddenly I'm prudish person as myself is transformed in your presence you know I notice every time I get a chance see when a group gets together and recites the whole bag of it would sounds like very laborious task I'm tired everyone always says and this is not an exaggeration can we do it again tomorrow because it's a transcendental experience and everyone always feels that this again we broke through somehow just by saying the versus together yeah I suppose if you do to the Sanskrit
 and the English
 it takes about three and a half hours so
if you do them both and probably take you five five and a half for 6 because he's doing the different years that we did it there a priest prakash you could do the Sanskrit very fast
 they just asked me to do the summary of the of the versus at the end of each chapter and I'll be like kind of zipping along trying to you know look at it and gather my thoughts and before I know it gave me at the end of the chapter
 let's let's one we start you know why don't we start with talking about the campaign by Shea sugar from you could you share what it is that you're doing and what you been doing over the years with this bug of agita campaign and how people can participate
 sure well first of all we several years ago will be rebranded the key the giant T-rex
nobody knows what that means so we called it World key today so if it has one more General appeal to people and it already has General appeal it's one of the points of the bog of Akita crosses over into cultures all over in the around the world various cultures anyone who's read the bhagavad-gita finds that it's common sense of color and profound at the same time and they feel that it's not religious fanaticism at all but it's the definition of the laws of the material nature and how to not only be in harmony with them that also to Rise Above The Binding forces of this world so you get a jaunty as you mentioned before has been an event during which for decades at least in our organization we've concentrated on
making the bug of agita available to people and over the last seven years or so we've worked hard to expand the reach and so
 every year we make a goal to increase the number that goes out to people in the world in various languages interesting Lee we set it go for 1 million Bhagavad Gita is distributed in 2020 does anybody remember what else was a peculiar year when we said a million bug of agita when we announced it that that was our goal people around the world said that's amazing and when we hit the goal actually we went over it that year it was
 it was a big celebration
this year after year we've been increasing the number but more importantly we've been increase increasing our capacity by developing networks or what we call pipelines that go out to people all over the world in various venues so they can get the bug of agita in multiple languages and now this year it's 3.7 effect I'm in Mumbai right now I just flew in here last night to Rally the devotees here because here in in Mumbai and various other places in India. They're doing an amazing job of getting the bug of agita out to people of the world working with many of the leaders here in India so this year the gold is 3.7 million bug of Akitas every year we remove the number up a little bit as part of the ad campaign that begins today it's actually began the day after bunch of purnima
January 7th so we give this loss of time so everyone has an opportunity to participate people are busy in their lives that we want everyone to have a chance to do something to get the bug of agita out to other people and so far I mean don't tell anybody this anybody on this call don't pass it on but we've gotten more pleasure than 3.7 already
 so I don't want to jinx anything but you know we're certain we should educate edge of our seats yeah we like to keep it at a level where we can do as we say smash to go and really what it is is all over the world their devotees mobilized around this time of year to to open up the faucets and let the bug of agita go out and multiple languages all over the world that gives people who love the bug of agita and they want to make sure they are the other people have a chance together can I ask you something
sure
 so you is you hold the face in your mind and in your heart that it can actually help the world that that the people the world would benefit if we can get millions and millions of bug of agita out there can you share why you feel that way
 it's a personal experience I had 1972 Martha Pollack a friend of mine at high school Del Valle High School and raise their 1972 she just came over to my house and gave me this copy of bug of agita was a small copy just translations and at that time in my life I was in high school I was 16 years old and I was one important question I wanted to answer was why you have to die and why do I have to do anything if I have to die what's the point of it all and it was a trying time I won't go into all the details but
years before I was
 greatly shaken when President Kennedy was assassinated I have friends who died on hiking trips that all types of
 existential angst in my life and then when I got the bug of agita I have been searching for many years for some answers and it it was so complete so straightforward and so personal the same time I read it every day when I come home from school and it gave me such great Solace and then I came in contact with my teacher but after I haven't received a magazine and saw an advertisement for his rendition of the bug of agita call the bug of agita as it is now even though I read all the translations I still had a lot of questions because some of the language in bug of agita goes back to the date is out it was spoken 5,000 years ago
and I went as soon as possible and I got that copy of Bhagavad Gita as it is and then it really came alive for me because the commentary given by Sheila Prophet answered all the questions and also questions that I hadn't thought to Aunt asked he answered and
 it's been my Mainstay for 50 years since that time the bug of agita it's as if I had come and it answered that the most important question of my life and it has given me a line message with my life's purpose by reading the bug of agita so I feel so grateful for having received it or you know if it would came unexpectedly into my life that time Martha Pollack gave me that book at that I reached out to Martha to thank her
eyesight please continue well that's it I mean it's very personal experience I know I trust the buggy. I read it on every day and it is something that really brought me to
 yeah and you know I appreciate that on a personal level but you you kind of made it a mission to actually see that millions of these are being distributed do you feel that
 that's like a massive wave of the distribution of bug of agita can communicate change the world you know you know have some kind of broad affect the Book Exchange the world first of all books to communicate well they've been in human society for thousands and thousands of years people used to find all kinds of things to write on before there was paper and
 books cannot be denied even if people write bad books anybody ever given you a book
and just can't get rid of it any books our beloved in human society actually what they are as a delivery system books are a delivery system for idea seeds and if you look at some of the world's most persistent ideologies in economics and politics and philosophy you'll find that the origin was in a book someone takes ideas and they organize them well and they write them down and then they put them in a delivery system called the book and they get out in human society those seeds go out and they they say for instance
 most people have heard of evolution darwinian Evolution most people haven't read Origin of Species and mine and none the less the book already went out too late and the Caesar everywhere and therefore it's a thing and America itself was the American Revolution
started because of a book that was distributed in the colonies profusely everybody bought it affects still nowadays it's the the most it's the best-selling book of all time per capita of any other book is called common sense to Fantastic book so well-written, Spain and the effect of books is is still there if you wanted if you want to embed an idea in society write a book and then distributed widely so yes I do I believe that it is
 Krishna was the original thought leader influence influencer okay I'm convinced now how can I take part I would like to shoot maybe a case or two these books and and and chipping
 you can sponsor a case and
first of all you can take the case yourself and distributed there's 24 beers in a case a hundred $20 per case or you can sponsor it and we already have pipelines go out all over the world we spend all your finding ways to get bug of agita us out to people in in areas all over the world we have prison spect I went to a prison in Arizona and I went inside they close the door behind me to and I thought you know just remember I wasn't in here before I had I met with an inmate there who had been his life has been changed by the bog of getting incidentally he's in he's in with no possibility of parole
 and none the less it becomes so influenced by the bug of agita so I went in and I spent time with him at there and when I came out the chaplain who is taking me from place
place it on the little bus with all the prison guards coming out he said you know your guys been talking a lot of people in your neck that Billy I said yeah we need somebody like I said how many said at least 400 one person who reads the bug of agita and he's funny too cuz you know he wears orange that's what brahmacharya is where he also has a head shaved that's a problem so he wakes up early Rama Chari I can hold days in the old days of his, used to write the inmates
 okay I asked you why you always my why you so happy and he said a lot of people ask me that that's what I wanted to ask because that's when I start telling about Bhagavad Gita and it doesn't matter where you live because if you change your inside for me the bug of agita then you're free
that is no joke you know it's to consider that you could be living on his situation that seems like the most horrific and and terrifying oppressive and you can actually find happiness even in a prison if you know how to see the world through the eyes of of wisdom
 yes so we have these we get books out to prisons we get them to other countries around the world we have South America where people so great it's amazing the videos and the messages we get back from people who receive these books some of them can't afford them and we're constantly finding ways to infect we just found out a pipeline to the Philippines so we getting books out to places of the world's hospitals and so forth so when you donate for a sponsor a case or more of a bag of Akitas it immediately goes out we're just waiting fact there's there's devotee
standing by to get them out as quickly as possible as soon as donations come in and open the drawer I sure. There's a pocket veguita as it is I was like what the heck of it as it is so if I'm separated us three options that people can do one is that they can buy case that get shipped to them self that cost $120 to get 24 glitches and you can pass them out as you like your friends your family to strangers whatever the other option is that you can just donate and say hey send it out through one of your pipeline I would like to send it to prison or to hospital or tell me what the other pipelines are and then you can choose one of those pipelines
 and then a third option is that you can
send I think I'm not sure if it's any number of ghee deserve it's like in groups of ten like you can send 10 gifts out to 10 people that you choose will mail it if you give them the address so you can send 10 or 20 or 30 pizzas at $10 per Gita and they will personally be shipped where you passing to be shipped set sound right yeah those are for film director in a lot of the things she wears a lot of hats and see when the nicest people on the planet to work with is I mean like all of us on this team we're a little crazy so whatever you whatever request you make will try to fulfill it we also I mean just to give you an idea when we placed sets of srimad bhagwat Thompson Antarctica is a hole there's a
 a documentary about it we made recently so we're willing to get Bhagavad Gita set to anywhere a mile yeah we'll go the extra mile we just want to make sure they
well you don't molony has a reputation of being not only like working very hard to get these pieces out quickly but just being a very sweet and pleasant person to get to know
 and he's amazing and it makes it easier just call this number or you can also send a WhatsApp message to this number or text to this number or you can call this number and speak to Molly Molly Molly me personally the number is plus one 669-289-5563 again that's plus one 669-289-5563 and I have a pressure to stay by I think that I you know I'm going to I'll donate a couple cases so that'll be like 240 and you know it would be wonderful if you know amounts of wisdom of the Sages
say we does she like 10000 or something like that we could be great yeah so think about it it's a nice thing to do as soon as you come to the end of the year if you feel grateful to the podcast of you feel grateful to the devotees of you feel grateful to the literature and the wisdom that that's making a difference in your life then you know this is the kind of face that people when you have faith in the geese in the Bog time you said like it's not like I'm losing $120 it's like it comes back and you know it in in the in the form of so many special gifts you know how necessary material gifts but talked about wanting to change the world here you go to universities it was talk about prison universities
 oh yeah we definitely go out to universities there are multiple University programs and around this time we provide bug of Akitas
all of these programs and we also have a program that it attracts a lot of young people children in fact than their parents will be the champion and these kids practice memorizing verses from the Bhagavad Gita some of you might want to look up online called the Sanskrit of fact it was a study done shows that the great benefits of memorizing sounds good verses to Children's brains or anybody else has been affected by over a hundred bucks if you keep their she is little over a hundred slow cuz remember I said she's 10 now but even back when she was 8 she had that time she's coming to my poor with us in February maybe maybe the two of you could meet them
 I'd love to Fantastic this might sound crazy but I would love to do it like an experiment where are you have like a federal
prison on one side and then you have the costume is prison on the other side because stupid is the warden called prison and rectify person with a solitary confinement lousy food lift just lifting weights are playing basketball we've got a way actually to rectify you're really want to transform a person that can't go anywhere and captive audience wish I could still buy you should start a prison you can do the world K I'll help out I'll help out if the guards at the prison guards I'll be a nice prison guard and a shot for everybody lets me charge of the diet I hear they're very profitable
okay well thank you so much for such a move this is great the war at what the world needs now is love sweet love via the bug of agita how to connect with source and you are even like the poster child for giving knowledge to people for decades now we're very honored that you're on the show related to talk to us and how we can do it and how we can really celebrate Gita jayanti not just Channing it but giving it to other people thank you so much it's interesting that you know we see this distribution as a hisun Anna it's not just
 Distributing a book but it's it's something that Christian mentioned in the bug of agita himself you'll see in the 18th chapter of the Gita near the end you can you take
it's okay I'll just allude to them but if you distribute Bhagavad Gita there's a way that you could you come closer to Christian up much closer and it's it's a it's a way that you become friendly with Krishna and those who distribute by going to get it can feel that
 I want to hear your versus right versus a lots of fact I do with my kids we grew up playing the 10th chapter game I turn the temperature after into a game where else a of like for example suppose you and kaszuba are I would never be able to drive out of immovable things I am
 tamales like that so you have one point the stupid has zero then I'll use it at
do you think I am I am with the MOG that's the game and it helps the kids memorize it because kids just want to play games but you can play that with your friends you can play with your Sage groups and it gets you to memorize the 10th chapter as well careful so that's why I love the bug of agita and I don't mind jumping in first is it time to share a favorite verses sure one of us will go round and whatever or Sheriff you would you like
 okay
 sorry about that this is a little cluster I like versus in clusters so this is chapter 67
 This Confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere or devoted
engaged in bhakti devotional service nor to one who is envious of me that much in a bit until I came into contact with Eastern thought but the idea of you want you want something that somebody else has and that's our predicament and material world I want to be the center I live through my ego I find my pleasure through my ego and once you have that Krishna just back so off he puts a little shield around so if you can't get to know Krishna so is it just explaining of how to get close to Krishna and he says in 68
 for one who explains the Supreme secret to the devotees pure devotional Services guaranteed and at the end he will come back to me this is why the wake up in the morning you know why do wake up and do the show today today I was I had a broke my regular side in the today and night I stayed up late
if you want. If you want full disclosure I stayed up late and watch a mixed martial arts till like midnight last night my story in the first verse of the Gator I have you guessed right but it it ruined my job of the new I was expecting to wake up anyway cuz I usually wake up anyway but it didn't work and I'm just a little bummed out and I didn't get to have my job done so so anyway but this is the reason to wake up in the morning beautiful Services guaranteed so I didn't feel good but I think that what we're doing is important according to the Gita and then Krishna says he clarifies it even more there is no servant in this world more dear to me than he or she nor will there ever be one more deer
 and I declare
 that he who studies the sacred conversation of ours worships Me by his intelligence
and one who listens with faith and without Envy becomes free from simple reactions and its hands to the auspicious planets with a Pious well
 nice beautiful
 hey beautiful
 expect you must love those you must live those must be tattooed on you but she should at least at least tattoo in your heart definitely at in fact I gravitated towards those as you noticed in the beginning because it's so personal that Krishna spoke this with the intention of giving to everyone infected says that in the chase on your charger Rita that and it's that when Christians spoke to us to Arjuna he sold all the world's problems in one Fell Swoop just by talking to one person and then the dialogue went out to everyone
I asked you a question to chase Cooper boo yes my son asked me this question I couldn't answer it so he's supposed to Bhagavad Gita Krishna and Arjuna I said yeah he said who wrote it down while I said well sunjaya actually explain the dialogue cuz he had a Mystic Vision so he could hear it and he said but who wrote it down and I was like who did write it down how do you answer a question actually we just had a great scholar and a couple weekends ago radhika Rahman from you comes once once a year and speaks at our community in Silicon Valley and he talked about the oral tradition of the Bhagavad Gita and the other literature literature thrilled thousands of years old and amazing facts
 the oral tradition was more
 easily preserved
then the written tradition when writing came into focus at a certain time there were scribes and they were like coffee machine sometimes they were illiterate they just copy things and before that yes because the culture was so inherent to the process of memorizing all these they'd actually memorize them you'll find people and families and India Coke like she maybe that means they had family memorize three full days thousand verses so actually the bug of agita and other literatures from The Vedas were spoken for many many generations and then there was a certain time when they were written down of course you know we hear stories of Ganesh writing them down has gas and a smoke them
 I can't speak to them when they were originally for
written down but actually that the tradition is oral and for various reasons that radhika Ramon Prabhu brought up it was preserved perfectly and especially bug of agita is it has been preserved in its original state because it's been commentated on and you can follow the commentary Trail back under its and thousands of years right great teachers of Foxy over many generations in that record shows the bug of agita completely intact it's been carefully guarded for many many generations are a lot of people they find that very difficult to believe but we have people on this podcast that just shows you know what we're going to memorize chapters of the Gita and we started doing that when we are brahmacharya is I know Nicki and the Chandra he has our can you sign up for memorization sloka class on our website
 are you writing to
to was going to say just what I thought, you get the info that you need to join a okay we have a slow cooker study group and you'll be amazed at how much you can memorize and then you meet people who actually memorized the Gita memorize even bigger voluminous with the word voluminous books and we've just given up on it's almost like a muscle we don't use any longer and and you have a knife or not just Indie of a culture is all around especially Eastern countries that was all in memory and reciting and sometimes like the other day I was in like a second hand store and I was with my son and he goes once that need points to some very peculiar 1950s calculator machine and like an abacus but like weirder and I was like you know what I don't know what that is it's like we've lost touch with old instruments and this instrument is our mind our intelligence anymore so with this sort of like watch little clips that happened in you no less than a minute
and that's all our attention span goes for so okay thank you for that
 I'm did you want to share some of your favorite shlokas or shampoo
 sure
 one comment is that memorizing verses from the Bhagavad Gita
 although I'm not absolutely necessary to do so you can read them the relish Omer even listen to others read them recordings of that but even at a gymnastics feet although it does take a little bit of concentration and repetition but each one of them has such deep meaning and it's a wave absorbing the mind I find there's so many distractions nowadays in the mind can easily give up and just give it into some sort of mindless engagement scrolling is one and almost the polar opposite to that
thinking of the first of bug of agita okay so one of them that I liked that sort of follows with his train of thought this is one some of you may have known or heard but it's it's the Beaverson bug of agita that Sheila Prophet commentated upon or spoke upon more than any other verse in the Bog of Akita you know what it is supposed to wear a rug 5.9 I guess at 1515 it's 71 it starts trembling touched she knew and in this first Christian says you speaking it true you should with mind attached to me he says attach your mind to me and he said he knew if you just here then you'll understand everything without any doubt
 and then in the next person goes on to say what you'll understand every
phenomenal and numinous which means everything was in the material world and the spiritual the part that I find absolutely stunning about that and encouraging is that if you just here now that's something I can do I can show up and listen I don't have to do anything fancy I just have to be there and be aware just listen and just by listening he sent touched you in this first you'll come to the stage of Consciousness you'll be really fixed in mind and and in heart all so you'll know where you're going you'll know the purpose of life your doubts will be cleared he says and all you have to do touch screen o just here carefully the vibration itself will inform you and just to relate to that another verse in the bag of Akita 1010 Krishna says patients at the tree people come to Danny Pudi
I felt so close to Krishna because he said I'm there within your heart and if you're sincere and you just try for this
 the diamonds I'll give you booty intelligence open the the the door for you I'll let in the light better for I can throw in there and he's there ready waiting so if you just try to hear if you just shows a little sincerity even if you think I don't know anything and I can't even understand what's being said even then which is something that Trump had said when he first started listening to his spiritual Master he said I couldn't understand everything you were saying but I stayed and I listen and then it all became clear
 those are two verses that I cherish every one of them is like an individual little Temple you can enter into and they are fully engaged in but those are
I think of frequently thank you
 I'm you know I wanted to share versus actually not in the bug of agita
 but that is part of the keto related if that's okay
 and I'm sorry we're not accepting that today all right okay so this is from Schumann bhagat on first cancel chapter 15 test number 27 and it's some this this versus spoken by Arjuna so it's even more you know teacher related and this was spoken you know as I practice fucking moron the years go on and you know I have friends like right now I'm staying with tarp Google you know it and he and I you know what's 30
years ago we're reading bug of agita together you know and relishing it and now here we are 35 years later and doing the exact same thing and relishing it more than ever before you know it was like that it's it's because because it's it's it's not mundanes. It is actually spiritual and it's you find that actually it's really unlimited there's always more in it but beyond that you know beyond just that this helps guide my life and this is relish able to read and discuss and gives insights
 in arjuna's case and in our own cases it also saved him when he was in The crucial moment of his life right in that crucial in that you know we read the whole Mahabharat you see that when are June is on that battle for the whole books been building to that moment where she's being called upon to step up and take up a very difficult task and everybody's look at him looking towards him to accomplish it
any breaks down and so everything that externally everything that he had built in his life from from going from like his own personal deepest relationships like with that that he had with his own wife who had vowed that he would step up on the battlefield 4 you know and his brothers those that he loved the most but but but you know his reputation as a warrior was on the line but beyond that you know there was a huge political consequences to him stepping up in that moment and he was entirely unable to
 innocence was in it was crushing and embarrassing that that it is a key moment in your life you you hesitate you you you you you check it out you know and
 this verse speaks to that that when you're in your toughest point in life if you're accustomed to hearing hearing wisdom then it it can
gave you in that moment and then become so powerful transformational so this was spoken after Christmas had left right Chris had passed on from the Earth
 and arjuna's brother you to shoot who was king at that point
 he saw all kind of inauspicious elements
 and when when Arjuna returns to him to hastinapur
 he begins to ask you know I've seen all kinds of inauspicious almonds and then when I look at your face
 I know something's wrong and he begins to list all the possible things that all the inauspicious things that he meant that Arjuna might have done or seeing that might have caused him to feel that way
 and in the last one he mentions is or could it be that you know our beloved Shri Krishna has has departed and our Genesis yes that's that's what happened then he tells the story about how that happened
and although his own personal grief in that moment
 and then he shares this person this versus beautiful you know that it's it's it's such a nice first you know so you saying you I'm going through it's been very hard for me but and then it shows this texts again is short bob Tom Canto 1 chapter 15 x 27 I read the Sanskrit Day Chicago
 rnt smartest Chatham golden beetle
 now
 the meaning like now that I've got I'm going through so much difficulty in grief but but there's something that I hang it on to right now now I'm attracted to those instructions imparted to me by the personality of God had Govinda SRI Krishna because they are impregnated
with instructions for relieving The Burning Heart
 in all circumstances of time and space but no matter what or how difficult it is how crazy that you're going to find something there in the bug of agita that's going to give you the direction that you needed I just thought maybe I could read a little bit from the commentary the proper chairs here he writes the problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the battlefield of Kook chaitra was solved by the teachings of the bug of agita again after the departure of the Lord from the vision of Earthly people when Arjuna was face-to-face with being vanquished it isn't in his acquired power and prominence he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the bug of agita just to teach all concerned that the bug of agita can be consulted in all critical times not only for Solace from all kinds of mental agonies
any other people had just gone through so much mental Agony in this world right we both feel it not only for Solace from all kinds of mental Agony but also as a way out of grade entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical our Pharisee material exists okay he continues he says the merciful Lord left behind him the great teachings of the bug of agita so that one can take the instruction of the Lord even when there when he is not visible to the material eyesight
 material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lord but by his inconceivable power the Lord can incarnate himself to the sense-perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable
Manor through the agency of matter which is also another form of the Lord's manifested energy plus the bug of agita or any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lord is also the Incarnation of the Lord there is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord himself one can ride the same benefit from the bug of agita as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord
