 let them eat the grass I agree but you know I think they have some trauma with the electric
because one got caught in the electric fence when I was not here hot in it yeah. That's horrible I know I know and I don't want to put them in back in the electric fence
 just touching that thing is like right now I'm mad at you. I know I touched it once I thought you many times and sometimes you get a little shocked and sometimes you get like a shock if you're trapped on it I think they're little traumatized so they don't want to go in the fence they don't want to stay on the other side of the bridge they want to come here and they want to eat all the flowers
 anyway that's what we're dealing good care of those vicious
 which
 August seems a little distressed with me about the not marriage around the flower bed came are you go easy on the sheet
I sent anti sheep sentiment, from the early nice little kind of one of those little fences around the flowers maybe you can figure it out I'm sure you'll figure
 anyway let's get into this message is for today what's going on today
 text message to promote the shuffle.
 We're giving away any of them presents for wearing him now that's over to the love of your heart there you go

my dick gets you don't say dang it that's did it has stayed around for about 40 years though it is like a really groovy way of expressing groovy maybe can dig it still say dig it
 it's boss it's
 okay let's see what's a joking mood today okay
 how to get to the nugget nugget and it is from Cesar Chavez
 who's Cesar Chavez he was like a labor union kind of leader in California I think he kind of brought together all like the farmworkers you know you created some important Union of Farm Workers okay but I think
combined like Catholic teachings with his you know activism in some way he became quite the legend I think
 he says the end of all knowledge right like we said bhakti vedanta we said the end of the world should be service to others could get more specific but a body of a down to the end of knowledge is bhakti which is loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord how do you serve the Supreme Lord destroy the devotees thank you cuz you said it or maybe he got a book I like this probably called God of knowledge
yeah the video Until the End of knowledge you no one can study all this vast
 medical literature but then what what is it what is the Sid hunter in Alec what is the conclusion real what is the vedant what is where does it all end in the Box the Box leave it on. They say that it ends with service right at and in this is important because I mean support on many levels but I think just
 probably on the level that he was speaking he realized something about our nature right that we find our meeting and we find our true happiness and service right now. That is not in exactly in being served as in serving others that we find our purpose and meaning and happiness so you know I think he caught on to that but also do you know where we're going with it I think also is that
 when you interpret these there's two schools of a danta Wright
is the bucket Bay tantas which is the the kind of path that we follow
 and then you can say there's a good way to instill good way to wait on things and you don't like friends if there's a famous in waiting room in a marshy
 an interesting person you lived up there in the mountain and I don't doubt that the that that he had
 that he was in his
 in his practice and that he had some deep realizations
 but he is the conclusion of it where you know in the mind of the Book of John does it falls apart right like he was want to ask
 how should we treat others
 how should we treat others and his aunt do you know the answer is guys widely quoted his hands like we are all others know there are no others
 there are no. I like that one
weather starting to bug again there are recorded bug of agita that you know there are means we see people as see people as you and as that's not what he meant to say that's not what he meant in the absolute sense there are no others there's only one that that that the experience of me being me and you being you is an illusion that in truth that all dissolves and there is only one being one Divine energy
 that's what he meant when he said there are no others he didn't mean like you see what we say is were one and different so you're you're take your you're appreciating the Oneness in one sense yeah we're all made of the same energy and in that sense we're all one
and I suppose you could stretch it and say there are no others
 we are like I mean if you are all unique personalities but we're connected yeah that's that's her old or strong enough thread
 Max Farrelli's each Pearl is unique East Pearl is glorious East Pearl is shiny each Pearl is valuable and there's an underlying source that connects us all
 yeah you know in the bug of agita
 there's any epic it also speaks that you know this text at 7:19 about hunam Germany and K when you get to the end
 you know of Guiana I don't know I'm just going to have too many births even
 at the end of a reverse Dianna Vaughn one was a chief knowledge that person says Mumford Padgett a that they surrendering to me he doesn't say
that they realize that all is 1 actually what he says is he does say Vasa Davis or vomity he really is a diversity of our Krishna is everything when you realize that Krishna is the cause of all causes then you just want to say you just want to give your life to him you sent ya used to it so that's where knowledge leads is that when you meet someone serve you want to just like how many more you want to sit at their feet and just hear from them when I serve them it's a natural thing it's a natural thing across the valley so you know when at the end when
 when I say we keep saying and you know the end of all knowledge at the end when Christians turn storage units as you don't have you heard me cuz this all makes sense to you you know how you feeling I have to hear them and Christian doesn't see Christian says my Illusions now been destroyed I wasn't illusion before you spoke this illusion is gone
he doesn't say it now I realize there are no others that we are all one that did that. You know he says no now I'm ready to serve you
 right now I'm ready to serve the individuality that Christian has and that Arjuna has it doesn't say now that my Illusions gone I realize that our individuality was illusion is no now I'm ready now that my Illusions gone I realized I'm ready to serve you the illusion was that I that I was trying to seek happiness in some other way in a threesome external temporary thing when delusions gone the end of all knowledge I want to serve Christian and through serving Christian serve others and in what Manner or you can say the other way to to serve another serving Cristiano Chris Chris is in the heart of every living being
 come on revoked wake snap out of you the grumpy old guy today you're grumpy he
I think of the sheep sheep sheep on my mind it's all right since that you got me it's okay what happened to Ryan and the musket the on that I'm chiavetta wrote them deivam set us what they may be awesome to do before he started she meant by the time we shiver means the conquest when should I expect the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan unto Noreen arraign Rishi the super most human being to other stars watching the goddess of learning and then she'll be asked today of the author not stopped praying from Bhagavad say bye bye to you tomorrow okay talk to you about a regular tennis in class in the baggage. Remember rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the Hara become eradicated
11:00 service to the Supreme Lord of his praise of transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh My Gana to mud and dust you just not as much as she could have made him a hug I was born the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet read it from the shoot my bow out of town Contra 7 chapter 14 text 17 how you feeling I hope you feel better
 let me start it let me just deal today okay let me see my let's have a little recap do that yesterday was really nice not just about how other people are viewing you the road I want to know in your own heart how did you figure out why it was a it wasn't it
it was a conversation was a great conversation and interview interviews are not necessarily Direction I tried to make it like that at first I brought all these bullet points and I was just like you know what I'm just going to talk to this guy and it was great he talked I shared I shared I shared some of the cat says was a great class yesterday so we've got the Great Sage Naruto
 speaking to the great king you just year explain what are the duties for married people people that aren't there not say it's in this yoga Society how they supposed to live and we're hearing you know like course the pitfalls are you know like wealth is one I've got my own money now I can go out and buy the things that I want
can set up my home the way I want it I can get the thing you know in in one can begin to drift off Funk and begin to slip into Lucian what can begin to lose their focus
 and so he's trying to provide some guidance history he's illustrating how the The Vedic texts say just threw The Vedic texts have provided guidance in Schertz how you regulate your life as a married person as a householder in such a way that it helps keep you on the right path you know keep it moving forward and not getting diverted
 and
 and you know what do you do if you have wealth will he send you know you have to invest that in yoga you have to let you know you have to invest sacrifice that in some way
 that brings your own Consciousness to the truth that hopefully involves others and bringing their awareness to the truth so that you don't get diverted
haven't seen whatever wealth one sheaves as my ticket to external happiness invested making an offering turn in I'll put it back in to 22 the universe put it back into God and it in in this way keep your keep your focus their you know that has been within that Vedic contact you you put on events we were talking about I think we talked about about weddings last time we were speaking right
 wedding is kind of an example of something like that we will we do we might lose the purpose of it but the ideas let some invite everybody come here so that we get their blessings for this sacred
 ritual that were performing and then let's satisfy those people by feeding them well and putting on a nice event you know these these Vedic lug nuts for these Vedic ceremonies were kind of like that but with a tighter Focus you know it's a tidal wave bringing one
you know we didn't read it but in that text 16 in the commentary
 she probably has his wife in his when there's talk of y'all gonna talk about the sacrament you know we picture this Young Guns of the past ages but they're very difficult to do in this age we don't have that kind of wealth we don't have those purity of the ingredients to offer so we're does she'll probably go off and point us
 brother I don't know, thank you
 yeah so it says there's a there's a verse in the Bible time towards the end of the bar all the time like it's in the 12th Canto where talks about the different ages you know the different you guys and that in each of the you go there so you could Dharma right there's a there's a way of practicing there's a way of absorbing one's attention in one's actions
in a in a Dharma in a purpose that's tailored to the particular age
 in this age group goes there by Buddy Dimensions off for that in the touch of yoga
 one meditates on Lord Vishnu that was the yoga Dharma right you just sit down quite like a stronger you over you would sit down peacefully you know canoe with fully controlled senses go deep into a State of Trance connect to Lord Vishnu on your heart but as the ages change and it becomes more difficult to do that kind of thing in the trade to yoga is performing these elaborate yuknis and in the door Pogo its Temple rituals
 but in the Kali Yuga daddy care tonight in the color yogurts is accurate
of the name of how do you say you know especially the maha-mantra
 that we that be that becomes our young now that becomes the way that we sacrifice is simply by chanting the name is an offering and it's something that can be done publicly you know that can that can evolve everyone and get everybody like moving in the right direction you don't get everyone working together so you know she'll probably go off and say this is what you do need to do like this is this is as a society this is what we should be doing in this age is that we should be put it on big here taunts inviting people to come to them and feeding everyone Prasad my feeding everyone sacred food that's been made an offering to God that that formula right there I see him right now. And then he's like yeah that's right I like those events it's a powerful it's a powerful symbol
 formula
coming together sing
 your singing is
 it's magical people singing I'm not going to bring it today it is magical thing if you just sing songs it helps your mind singing is like been proven to affect the mind of people but but singing mantras yoga Dharma not the yoga Dharma thank you but it is that we only have the only way to help people become happy but as far as a transcendental map of self-realization yeah singing the maha-mantra singing The Sacred names of Lord Vishnu that's the that's the case it's getting together offering Rashad
 yeah yeah it's really the beginning in the end of the show involved with time you know the last I'll read you the last
superstition about someone jump to the end
 yeah it's good idea when when you do in a podcast that you speak I'm going to put this out there right now to both you guys I'm allowed to have a tough day okay that's okay to have a tough day okay and if you keep poking at it keeps making it worse it's going to get worse the last verse of the base is under the Supreme Lord Harry the congregational chanting of whose holy names destroys all Bad Karma
 and the offering of obeisance is on to whom relieves all material suffering circo's
 the great powerful statement in okay so now we're hearing a little bit about more about these sacrifices that have your house to does fat you know how how we engage our wealth how we focus it is not just spent on material
trees or wingless Vacations or things like that but now there's another way to invest it end and I think that
 you know whenever there's these kind of regulations
 there's always you know, we can approach him in a shallow way but I think nardis gun anticipated shallow approach to Ritual where we actually you know I think I think it's kind of like a religious Tennessee where we get into the rituals and we act begin to ignore people or we were insensitive to other people
 and so here I think he's going to kind of anticipate that and speak to like and it's speak to that connecting with people through it
 okay text 70 R17. Had said SRI Krishna is the enjoyer of sacrificial offerings yet although his lordship eats the ablations offered in the fire
your king you still more satisfied with nice food made of grains and Gigi is offered to him through the mouths of the qualified Brahman has he been serving him
 therefore my dear King the first offer prashad on to the brahmas in the demigods and after sumptuously feeding them you may distribute Prasad to other living entities according to your ability in this way you'll be able to worship all living entities or and the other work in other words the Supreme living entity within every living entity but here it is the whole gist of it you serve God by serving everybody else
 there is a God but God is more pleased when you serve the devotees
 yeah I ate his his you know imagine someone's got a little even if they don't have a lot but
if they have some wealth in their kind of putting on a a religious ceremony it were so prone to kind of like do it in a way where we kind of advertise our own piety and in our own exclusive connection with God you could say you don't want I want her to description of the most esoteric part of the bar with time of all the way to go to church which describes the red Christmas dress alila
 and you know when that wrestle Lila were like Christmas dancing with all of the
 with all of the gopis
 and then he kind of disappears and he's with one of them
 and then he disappears from that one
 and then they have to find him again
 and it's described that she had the feeling like Christmas just with me
 and I heard the description of the step one we think God is just our own he disappears okay
it is actually pretty profound you know even like when religious institutions think we're the only ones with access to God he kind of disappeared from that institution you know or when we can hear when we think that individually you know I'm the one that has a special connection of God we actually kind of lose our connection
 sure it so here is saying that you know this being being prone to that kind of narrowness
 he saying that when when you do this sack when you do it when you make these offerings when you put on the ceremonies when you create these events and so on do it in such a way where you really focus on satisfying everyone else satisfying God through satisfying everyone else in that way you won't fall into that it into into that narrow mindset it'll it'll protect you from that and it's saying that actually God in the heart of every living being is more pleased with that
no more pleased to see you serving in that way then trying to connect with him exclusively or directly
 8 x 19 a barometer who is sufficiently Rich must offer ablations to the forefathers during the dark moon fortnite in the latter part of the month of badger similarly he should offer ablations to the relatives of the forefathers during the Mahalia ceremonies in the month of Gina and now we're getting like times to do things right that that there's a calendar here and a responsible household is looking at that calendar and realizing that different days I'm supposed to
 state-regulated follow follow the path it's being laid out and and engage myself in if I can gauge in this way regularly it's going to have a
 and uplifting effect on my on my mind no salt according to like them
phases of the planets have to do with the auspiciousness or in auspiciousness of a day and
 even like with the Farmers Almanac there certain days to plant there certain Daisy harvest in the certain days you know and if so there's certain days of Performing sacrifice as well and it's just more effective on those days I don't know why it is like that but those who are sort of into the metaphysical world they're very acute to those in the same tuned into those in the same with the farmers are attuned to their Farmers Almanac
 what should perform the shredda ceremony on the mokara sakranti that's another the day when the sun begins to move north or the car cut 20 the day when the sun begins to move South what should also perform ceremony on the Mesa suck run today
to losik run today in the yoga named Betty Potter
 on that day in which 3 lunar TTS are conjoined is a whole study of the celestial bodies. They've during an eclipse of either the moon or the sun I'm at 12 lunar day and indy shravan nakshatra nakshatra what you perform the ceremony on the day on the 9th lunar day of the bright Fortnight of the month of Karthik that's a day is that Akshay tritiya that's the day we supposed to be getting things right but that's the one I guess it is the next one is not that I'm the ninth lunar day of the bright Fortnight of the party cuz I'll show you it's your tia is not in the car take me to talk another day I'm at 4
the winter season in the cool season on the 7th lunar day some people are really into all this stuff to know these things
 anyway if I was reading the sets were to skip over it but I'll read it nakshatra or the full moon day and I'm a day is when the moon is completely full or not quite completely full when these days are conjoined with a nakshatras from which the names of certain months are derived what should also perform the ceremony on the 12th lunar day when it is in conjunction with any of the nakshatras named Anuradha shrub enough to repel goonie or bhadrapada
 again once you perform the ceremony when the 11th lunar day is in conjunction with the 8th guitarra Pagani vodka or bhadrapada finally
so if you got all that finally once you perform this ceremony on the days can join with one's own birth star the gunman that shot through or with shravana nakshatra right what do we do with all this information cuz well you know
 how we practice bhakti it is going to be different for different people and she'll probably die so expert dad like he took from this tradition and he kind of boiled down to Assassin's for us so that we could so that we could have Gage in a practically you know as you're saying like some people really are into this ride like he knows people that all really you know they'll deliver according to this calendar year was quite impressive what we've been giving especially as more focus on like you are counters like Christmas birthday shoot on his birthday his birthday you know what the day Krishna live covered on health like we kind of Bring It Right to the essence of Krishna bhakti
cuz that's a lot even that's a lot we've got like we've got like a 20 solid holidays and leave and we're like yeah just trying to be essential sure and if we focus on all spaceship parts of the day we try to wake up early in the morning you know you're in the Brahma muhurta that that that time of day that sells fishes for for meditation and so on it and and and
 you know is benefit from from that you know from that are specious time we focus on a cottage cheese you know which roll around every two weeks or so and we try to make that time of more focus on Spirit you know what spiritual life so it's not that we ignore these things but we're only going to be able to engage in so much if we lived in a different world in a different Society you know that was all centered around this
 then we might be able to engage in a more deeply but you know what we find here in Volga time is it's going to say in the end you don't have to
you know like I said I read the last verse of the box I might just change Christmas names and so if these things going to help you keep your conscious there than grade and if there was going to be too much it was going to break you then we don't have to worry about too much so as even as we see this this chapter will come to this conclusion is going to begin to focus more on serving others satisfying God through serving others as a sacrifice and
 and finally got in your own heart that way you know that that that will become more these Central message it's it's presented
 x 24
 all these seasonal times are considered extremely auspicious for Humanity at such times once you perform all auspicious activities for by such activities a human being attained success in his short duration of life I love how the fact that they're they are likely to find success we have this other idea of success often and May
it means to be in a cover of a magazine or the win a gold medal or this is a whole different measurement of what successes in human life what are you going to do what are you going to spiritually become they are you going to resurrect your spiritual self in this life who cares if you've lived your full material human but you're miserable who cares right there's a lot of people really pushing them self or their potential I'm getting sick of potential I'm getting sick of potential because sometimes it's material potential and so in the name of the material potential they might give up their whole spiritual life
 who cares
 I don't care do you care
 text 25 during these periods of seasonal change if one bathes in the ganga or the yamuna or another secret places or if one chance offers
sacrifices or executes vows or if one worships the Supreme Lord the brahmins the forefathers the demigods and the living entities in general whatever he gives in charity yields a permanently beneficial result
 26 okane yudhistira at this time prescribed OU Canyon this year at this time prescribed for Reformatory ritualistic Ceremonies for oneself ones why for one's children or during funeral ceremonies and annual death ceremonies one must perform the auspicious ceremonies mentioned above in order to flourish and fruitive activities how to get good karma and that's not our goal here you know it's so you to share one since he speaking like this is the way this is kinda Elementary level that one enters in it once you know what's going to be very
 attentive to these details so that they can accrue Good Karma
auspicious indeed are the places where you skipped a continued now shall describe the places where religious performances maybe well-executed any place where there any place where a vaishnava is available is an excellent place for all most vicious activities in other words of the Holy place that the yeah. That's right the quality of the people what they want they hold in their heart you know what they embody you become a walking holy place you know it was a person like that we should want to be aspiring by shanavas we want to worship Lord Vishnu and follow the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and then for life becomes auspicious and people around us they have an auspicious life
 and all we have to do is focus on herself someone came to me with a story about like their children help you know how to help there
my answer is simple you just got to really just got to help yourself you got to really help yourself become a vaishnava we can't control what kids choose to do all we can control what we can control and then hopefully we set such a good example
 of love and understanding and kindness at the kid eventually says you know what I want to be like Dad or Mom
 okay yard in Una continue now shall describe the places where religious to secure the Supreme person I've got head is the support of this entire Cosmic manifestation with all its moving and not moving living entities and the temple where the DD of the Lord is installed is the most sacred place
 furthermore places we're learning Braman has Braman has observed the principles by means of austerity education and mercy are also most auspicious
and sacred so if you want to do some ceremony
 that's going to help bring your Consciousness to truth you know it's bring it to God bring it to truth elevated you pull it out of its Loops in cycles of ups and downs and and you know pettiness
 then you want a regularly do these kind of things you want to gauge yourself like this regularly and the idea is that the effect of it can go deeper if you're in a place that's conducive for it okay well what are the places as conducive for it and rather than just come right out of you know out of the gate and saying well there's this holy place and is that Holy place nardis the first thing he says it's you know if there's a person there was a violation of it was a box of Yogi you know someone that's got some depth to it than just being around then that's the best place to do it because when you're with
your way that ritual won't be a hollow empty one they're going to help pull your Consciousness into that ritual in a way where you know your focus right you know just just their presence of being there
 is is is it brings you to that it brings your own awareness to that place in and it's like that you know what we all feel that then the next thing it says is that you know Krishna he's that he's the support of the entire entire Cosmic manifestation it's all resting on him so sometimes you build a temple and that Temple is like the place where we come to have to have that Focus attention while you have an alter the whole thing the whole architecture is designed to bring your awareness right to that Central Focus so therefore Temple can be a good place to do it right it's not because
 it's some some religious concern it's actually like a yogurt concern right that when you're in that space once my naturally goes
too. And then he says what was the third one they said four more place where learned Brahman is observed very principles so it's so you have to go where the people are focused be around the people that are focused and you'll naturally become more focused in in this and whatever you're doing in and it'll be in a won't just be a meaningless a ritual it'll become transformed into
 auspicious indeed are the places where there is a temple of the Supreme personality of godhead Krishna in which he is duly worshipped and also places where their flow the celebrated sacred Rivers mentioned in the Piranhas the supplementary Vedic literature and spiritual done there is certainly very effective but one thing is the where the rivers are there is generally Shaker people worshipping the rivers you go to any know you go to the moon or you go to the ganga you know I mentioned in my book that even like
haven't been to the the ganga in Calcutta in a while but when I went to the ganga in Calcutta there's even though it's like a regular Shipyard where they're like loading cargo ships there is brahmins down there worshiping DD's of Ganesh and Chiba and a bunch of Indian ladies taking birth in sorry after taking birth taking bath and Sarris it's like a it's like where the ganga flows is people worshipping the ganga damn this is very interesting something
 it says
 whether the Supreme person I've got a Krishna Twitchy where is duly worship have you ever gone to a temple with the Lord is not duly worship he's actually more like a statue some temples it's almost like they never been taught how to worship properly and it almost becomes like a statue with some plastic flowers
after property sits at the bar so high in D&D worship that when we go to another Temple or sort of like wait a second are you working with a d properly here I feel like developed some discernment of what worship actually is and when there's worship appropriately you actually feel like this is a Sacred Space it's not even pretty space or you can feel that I was home to when they have to do a DD or yes or home like sometimes you feel like whoa this is Christmas present here this the energy is happening and then other times like this is just kind of like an afterthought
 yeah you can tell when the DD is properly worshipped I probably loved it you know there's some potency there
 we're just like Puja shaming people now okay
 okay the secret Lakes like push car
is that a sacred Lakes I push car
 we've had such a wonderful trip to pushkar Spring backs so interesting that hear their worship they're talkin about push car and my people are still going on pilgrimage to push car and Sarah sacred Lakes I push cart into the lake
 is it going to fill up for the camel festival is in near the lake looks like push car and the place is more saintly persons live like kurukshetra the banks of the palga river safety abunda have you been to say to say to bandar were seated around I don't even know that's like the bottom of India where they built the bridge is where the
that's a 20K amp dinner
 Abbas Abbas
 read read read about a lot I haven't been to push guard have been approved shhh I have been the guy I have been a priority I haven't been to a car I haven't been and I'm sure I know I haven't been to the banks of felger I'm going to say 2 but every time it is cuz I'm going to do our cup for Boss
 to your Tiara I have been to Matera Varanasi
 administer Audra I've been there but haven't been there been this rubber is in the
 open Explorer
 yeah Marissa and of course love her to caution her having to This Is Where the River Flows the places where Lord Rama Chandra and mother see
text shelter such as a coot this year
 and also the hilly tracts of land known as Mahendra and The Melia the Malaya is where the sandals Hannah would right
 all these are to be considered most Pious and sacred similarly places outside of India where there are where
 where there are centers Consciousness movement and where radha-krishna deities are worshipped
 worship worship
 Radha Krishna deities our worship must all be visited and worship by those who want to be spiritually Advanced I'm supposing probably just added yes one who intends to advance
all these places and perform ritualistic ceremonies to get results a thousand times better than the results of the same activities performed in any other place
 what is like a highlight I think devotees when do buddy say I'm going to go to Paris the first thing they think of all there's a temple in Paris isn't there or busy I'm going to go to Sweden wait there's a Temple and sweet like we don't fully enjoy a holiday unless we know is there a Temple there and if we if there is a temple everything how can I go to that Temple there
 and then sometimes
 you just go on some holiday and Krishna put the temple right there remember that letter we got from somebody they went on a holiday and some peculiar island off of England I can't remember who it was and they said yeah we got a Airbnb randomly
 and there was a temple right below us like in in in an apartment or something we heard them had him all the time it was like such a weird Christian maracle Christian Miracles happening
