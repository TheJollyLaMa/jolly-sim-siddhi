Will not just that it was like we had dinner a great day beautiful was a nice spread last night I'm here about in a 15 other ex boyfriend live live
 what we had a beautiful spread and then we have cure time then we I think we have an after-hours to your town I wasn't awake for that and then never went to a bunch of people slept over and we're having the show and breakfast I was like it's almost like a mini retreat it was like I think we're going to have special like a special concert nights in the summer
and then you brought a knife for one day and it's a 1-day Retreat almost is not even a day so I can overnight it's an overnight concert series and you broadcast that on this platform Circle platform Circle platform that's beautiful I'm so sorry to hear about that accident it does kind of it is consistent with the old address to make sure it does some align with the old aphorism I used to live by
 bad things happen when you leave the city
 are you kidding nothing too am I a r bad things happen in the city it happened in the city it happened in the city it happened in the city like I was trying to leave us
 this is why certain New Yorkers never leave New York cuz I used to live like that but I'm not that anymore or not today I like to
 but nobody was hurt huh no no accepted vehicle we had a beautiful
Knights Inn in the city you know there's a church right on the south part of Washington Square Park I do to me it kind of looks like Spanish architect yeah yeah it was in that church one of the churches it's not a function as a church that's kind of wide open there's no pews or anyting and it was just good energy in there. Yeah we had a beautiful time they went to 6 till midnight wow I didn't stay up all night
 are you getting some recommendations over here right now. The latest one was grow it out start massaging it with a mixture of Rosemary and Castro oils and I don't care so much I don't even look good with hair people you can stop cuz she was joking bring garage coming off soon real soon as my son sees Adam realizes it's going nowhere quick if you might like that's what's going to bring August get off of cut off the top of my head please
okay was it from my favorite and yours Leo Tolstoy not just Leo Tolstoy in Russia and he became a Everstart
 deep thinker a writer and then he was a vegetarian his wife wasn't happy that we could vegetarians used to go out with all his like servants cuz it at your account you have a bunch of Servants of the days of lots of servants he had like a little bit of a spiritual Community going on to like he had a huge Terrance because the poor didn't eat meat all icy so he could sit outside and she would eat alone
 well let's talk about her a little bit early
as we live through thousands of Dreams in our present life so they do
 oh yeah every night so is our present life only one of many thousands of such lives of the micro and the macro which we enter from the other more real life or real they're both real and months since we're both Israel and says we're going to answer one through one and then return after death
 our life is but one of the dreams that of that more real life
 and so it is read that again our life our life is but one of the dreams of that more real life and so it is endlessly and so it is endlessly until the very last one the very real life of God
 I hate to say it but this sounds like Ultra appropriation
I like to say that only because I know you guys aren't exactly where it came from yeah where we reading yesterday I was like this cultural appropriation yesterday
 oh yes it is nugget, man let me see I'll tell you when I said who I was like this is a cultural appropriation taking it all from the East to say okay listen in the preface I got this offer my study of Eastern philosophy now I'm going to bring it back to everybody knows anyways
 was that are only about every one job that came out I think everybody knew that this
buy a kind of stuff I'm pretty sure well I'm just saying you can't say you're appreciate what we talked about yesterday people say yoga is cultural appropriation to practice it in the west these guys actually the philosophies and wove it into their own teachings appropriation this is the guy that's that's that walks around saying turn your appreciation turned to her why didn't have appreciation for your expectations into appreciations yet she sounded like you too as well I'm just I'm just throwing it back at these at these extremists or was that you're you're stealing that you're a real person. In that anymore
 got them seagulls say whatever they want this is a great nugget again it's like it's like whether you have a night terror
every night terror kaszuba a night terror a bad dream bad dream some people call it a night terrors I suppose I have yeah yeah I had a weird one now I forget it I thought it was weird it yeah night terrors or these dreams ice and everything is like a dream like that or just sort of like some busyness sometimes all about a planner
 it's all like I have a reoccurring dream about okay we're in we're in the new house like a dream again and again like we're in a new house and the interesting thing is in this lifetime
 I've entered into a new home new apartment new home new house dream dream dream they're all dreams why cuz they're not here now and the only thing that separates those dreams for my dreams at night when I've actually moved around the country or something
the Venn diagram is
 they're all temporary I'm not in Canoga Park or Santa Monica or Brooklyn or they're all temporary they're all dreams in my mind just like I jumped at night this is a bit of a b p a motion the dreams I still have those emotions like all this is cool I was just real this is real is real kind of like he's saying I'm like imagine that say you sit down and you get plugged into a virtual reality
 now you're living in that world and the more time you spend in her the more real it feels then within that virtual reality you enter another virtual reality okay so like you're in the virtual reality and someone in the virtual reality as here put on these goggles and put it in now you're in a second virtual reality within the virtual reality that's why I can't play video games but I hold on
no runoff don't know how I am with you I'm holding hands walking together through this man holders now you're in that second virtual reality within the first virtual reality within reality and end in that second level of virtual reality
 you might say well this is just a virtual reality right yeah but it's it's as real and what you experienced in that
 you feel the same way as you felt it in the second virtual reality or the first virtual reality and and you feel it in a similar way as you feel in the reality these are all it's not any less real than the first level of the virtual reality and Tolstoy saying that we think a dream is just as completely different thing it's it's just somebody
are other category of of awareness will what about if we were in a similar thing right now sure and you know throughout the ages weather is coming from sacred tasks like bhagwa Tom you know Mahabharata ramayana weather or other stories and through other creative writers you know all the way up to Modern days and science fiction did Matrix and all that it's not like we don't get plenty of Clues plenty of ideas at least and let's not even say to say that this is fact but to get the stinking like to get a statement to get us thinking maybe there's something more maybe I should just say that this is the only reality in there can't be anything beyond this maybe I need to dig deeper I need to inquire I need to ask questions I need to hear from great thinkers and anything for yourself we're not saying this is Dogma like you were saying like what if
this isn't the reality is convinced that it was looking at your avatar everything like that the interesting thing is
 the mayor of machine here this is all been programmed by Bloodlines of whatever she's about them telling me Papa Tony of bloodline the color of the pedigree like different races and things like that but the program it's just really the avatars and program what's it like to step away from the programming that's the real sword
unconditional. We're trying to do with the srimad bhagwat very interesting look at my kids by myself all day but push came with me and I'm already in illusion I don't want to go to double illusion I'm already in a big illusion double the illusion that right and it will talk about fantasy yesterday double illusion write fantasy right that our meditations fantasy Devolution how about you play a game with me called let's get out of the illusion then where we go to video game yeah go backwards and we will the fact that we're not each other like Spirit Souls instead of picking up virtual machine guns of blowing up zombies are the fact that we want the movie or we want the virtual reality or we want the fantasy is an indication that the fantasies and satisfying so we need to turn it around and go back to the
reality and since so you know again here here's here's a whole story saying that this life is just like a dream this whole lifetime if you took the whole thing then you then you enter into the next room that's your next life and it's like a groundhog day thing where you keep going until you learn what you need to learn he says what do you say our life is but one of the dreams of that more real life you have a real life that we need to wake up too and so it is endlessly this is pure upanishads pure Bhagavad Gita
 you take birth again and again and again until the very last one but what's the difference with the very real very real now you get into her the very real life of God in other words when you realize your connection with God when you realize oh it's you that is reality is in connection with you illusion is in disconnection from you now
that's the price you know that's like the fundamental principle very interesting what do we look like underneath the body
 you know what I mean we look like something but your Eternal for him maybe maybe I know what yours is I know exactly what your last night and that was very and Mara what do you think are the cows that's a nightlife in the material before starting to shoot
at what time witches are very mean the conquest when should I prospective obeisances to the Supreme Lord Dyan unto Narendra see the supermoon Steven be learning and she'll be asked to be the author not stopped right age for vibration in your devotees all the Troublesome to the heart and lovely service to the Supreme Lord was praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact, Guiana tell Miranda I offer obeisance he's out there Lotus feet
 ready for the shoe my bag of Tom Canto 7 chapter 10 x 40
 yeah
10:40. Their first word okay text 40 who's speaking speaking to you to steer we're talking about how do you have the the Giant Peach I have repeatedly come again and again take a different avatars themselves are forums dreamlike beings where they end up getting liberated by the Lord and then they see them getting the same they get the same form as the board once their liberated are killed by the Lord very interesting this is like 10 chapters winding up right here cuz it all started with chapter 1 of this cancer it's also a sort of like if I ran at the shoes you bought on here is better but this is a good example for all of us if I ran a tissue pom
 I just asked you to call
I ran into she's asking for audience out there who is just dark envious to the core you know how envious he was he after he would be a king Kingdom he would take their leaders and put them in a dungeon
 and then he collected kings that he was going to offer to Kick In The Head who said he was like sick in the head type of King now if I was to hear about that'll be like you are so freaking sick I know but
 there again I'm I'm I can assess him but I don't know him he's got a back story he's actually coming from
spiritual world and all the man and he ended up getting liberated and all those kings that he kept they were all liberated by Lord Krishna also
 matter fact when Krishna went to liberate all those kings were kept in the dungeon Christian said I am so sorry you were in such a horrible situation and you what they said when someone really was said when they went through all that trauma it's almost like they've got a pass on forgiveness everyone else has to keep forgiving except you guys and they were just like well it's only by our Karma we got this actually everybody get some Karma and so you don't have to be the perfect balance right there's a perfect balance they were not harboring resentment Revengers fight it was like such a lesson of both ends
the way I'm telling you right now I think it's happening in the University's I'm going to be in limited is getting narrower or because we've created all these little terms that we snap to and we won't run able to expand like to say yes and you know like a victim blaming that's a thing it is certainly a thing but that doesn't mean that victims don't necessarily play a role in their own say it until the dogs I don't understand that helps us overcome the suffering here Krishna
 is it I feel so bad that you're suffering in this way
 he doesn't he doesn't just come and say this is your karma so what should I feel bad about right on our side we always feel bad for when people are in Suffern what can we do that's that's one half of the equation on the other side of the other side whatever I got I got this is no no no don't feel bad at all for me. You know this is weather was in this life
past life the results of a my actions have manifested in this way I want to be a better person right that let us let us look at the positive you know what I have a quoted the stream I bought with them the middle path reactions in this world because yesterday I had a lot of nuggets that we didn't even get to run enough you're always nothing. I try and you're a big bag of who this is this is this is coming from W Somerset maugham WC Fields I love him go ahead now
 do you know who he is Mara
 W Somerset maugham private school she doesn't know who that is over there
who wrote the book called The Razor's Edge
 I know God what a fanzine call the races but but it it's in that to book that he was his thinking was also I think he was really into like, I'm so Yogananda in that hole okay so he was also influenced by vedanta and now he's going to he gives a little talk on a little quip here on reincarnation, but speaking to the advantage that it plays a character development he says has it occurred to you that this that transmigration reincarnation in other words as it occurred to the transmigration is that wants an explanation and a justification of the evil of the world if the evils we suffer our result of the sins committed in our past lives
 we can bear them
 with the resignation and hope that if in this one we strive tour
virtue our future lies will be less afflicted
 I like that better way to flame out pain what we need to embrace this side of the equation in order to strive toward virtue right it would we will be more naturally inclined to strive towards virtue if from the when were little child when when we mistreat another child that the adults in the room doesn't just say stop that you're bad
 but she says don't you understand how the How the Universe Works that when you when you harm another
 whatever it is that you inflict on them is going to come back to you somehow in the future don't you know that's how it that's the law of the universe to love my mama wouldn't that be helpful for us to to to cultivate virtue and so Krishna cuz you're saying Krishna cost for and he says I'm so sorry
it doesn't eliminate compassion Christian comes for Christian himself comes for it I'm so sorry you went through this horrible predicament and this trauma I feel for you I feel your pain you know it don't know but he's not blaming
 and put and put on the Earth come from the other side the say no in order for us to become more virtuous you know lettuce lettuce own the suffering you know what the Den now you can heal from it rather just wallow in it forever and blame others and get theater and get it and then live in victim if you live in victimhood you get know where you're going to be sad forever and no matter who apologizes or what reparation you get to try to like pay that debt off there's never enough to pay it off once you once you accept yourself in that becomes part of your identity
 there's it's like having an unlimited desire will never be fulfilled you have to come to peace you have to forgive
never happened in the past to move forward with a peaceful mind
 W Somerset maugham right there right now thank you text 40 by Boxxy by devotional service. Ability to assess and Lee think of the Supreme personality of godhead receive bodies
 similar to hips okay we read the one about the Drone yesterday the Drone is actually not a w b a b I looked it up but somehow the worm is really afraid maybe drone maybe drone would have been the right word to use here maybe a second I'd imagine this thing stinks
 yeah but in any case see the way that the worm is terrified the warm is in his little hole-in-the-wall the the the the Drone of the WASP for the steam be whatever it is just right in there and it's like authors not Escape in this horrible creatures coming to kill me
this is like nightmare you want to talk about what did you call it earlier night terror night terror going to talk about terrifying and because it dies with its Consciousness completely deeply absorbed in the in the Drone in the wasp
 it tastes next birth where it's where it's meditation was so deeply absorbed in it becomes one itself so there's a principal there that principals Todd and Bug of agita I bet maybe maybe even little Kronos at first that you know that one yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum Bobby Shmurda album 10 year olds rocket of can't remember get the ten year olds and her memories are sharper
Corona Enlighten us where are you
 did she go
 little Corona she here just 10 years old
 I just now okay how are you
 island of the two lines the first two lines
 Sada Sada
 baba baba dada
 whatever state of being one remembers when they quit their body when they done this in the interesting way of saying right when you quit your body with a British British way of saying body with the body I wonder what your ego fishies a death Doula what does she think of that phrase which you like that she's here
with the body
 he likes she likes leave the body leave the buy quit it quit has a negative connotation about to die. I'm sorry you don't want okay whatever state of being one remembers when they leave the body or tuna that's the pain without fail your body a quitter the next to their fortas mod do you know the next first part of it does not serve a shoe College you don't know that one mama knows tomorrow you just whatever you remember at the time of death that I was therefore does not therefore does not serve a shoe College you all the time you should we walk around all the time Mom on usmart remembering me remembering Chris
and Yu-Gi-Oh and the same time fight like do your duties in this world dig into this world but always be remembered and pushing your background he says with your activities dedicated to me and your mind intelligence fixed on me this is the yogi right you will tame me without doubt in your next birthday cuz your mind is focused on me you'll retain me as the count was saying earlier count Leo Tolstoy until the final one where you obtained this Consciousness and then you have any return to the to the real life the life of God that the life for you your when your desorption is in God then you returned and then they all makes so much sense it makes sense and then he says this this is the next one text 88
 He Who meditates on me
 as of the Supreme personality of God in his mind completely engaged in remembering me she got every right in the sun in the moon in the water you right in the mountain in the air and in the heart of every living being
Carson Gage remembering me on deviated from the path
 Kia parts that is sure to reach me
 that's that's where this goes right so now this verse is saying it was the first ever reading today for saying that through devotional service to meditating on God then in your next life you got a body like that of God beating a body that's Eternal a body without all the frailties and all the problems of the body's this equipment that were in this is not the equipment were meant to be using this is like a faulty rental Rent-A-Wreck yeah I think of the Supreme personality of God had received bodies similar to his you want to God like body meditate on them I can find it in the gym
 yes -2 meditation
I want a black God this is known as the rupiah right you get the form the rupee Rupa surupa multi all the people in the back right now their kings thought of Krista as an enemy they also achieve the same race out cuz of my unbelievable right
 therefore everything you asked me about how shih Shu pollen others attain salvation although they were inimical has not been explained to share this with you that started back in chapter 1 of this cancer yeah yeah about Krishna personality of God had various expansions are incarnations of the Lord have been described in the killing of a to Demons option and no runny cuz she poo has also been described the right this narration describes the characteristics of great and exalted devotees the great exalted to go to provide Mirage
watch bhakti devotional service and it's perfect knowledge and his perfect patcher for material contamination it also describes the Supreme personality of godhead is the cause of creation maintenance and annihilation in his prayers has described the transit into the qualities of the Lord and is also described how the various abodes of the demigods and demons
 regardless of how much yearly opulent are destroyed by the mere direction of the Lord all of this is a summary of what we've learned in the past chapters and it's just hitting important points to to think of important points to contemplate we've seen even running koshy poo went up to the top you know but but but all of that is is ultimately destroyed his temporary prolonged got this in through through contemplate through understanding these ideas his devotion
came undeviating write his Consciousness was focused without deviation deeply dppo me why was Kelly was like it's okay well I mean if the entire universe is destroyed his father's going to get
 the principles of Dharma by which one can actually understand the Supreme percent of God had are called back about, okay that's important because he had because there's other types of Dharma likers 30 garmisch ostrich-like ethics of the running a country that the Dharma of a husband of the drug would have a wife a drama of a king the daughter of a queen yeah those High help those will help you cultivate at least they'll help you cultivate how to be you know why I'm a good person and how how to get good reactions if they're good for this
bility of the individual that good for the stability of the family they're good for the stability of the nation of the world of the universe but but but but there's something there's a deeper more confidential type of Dharma called bhagavat Dharma that's when you really know about the person behind it all by Gabon, of the soul and the souls Dharma artist but there's an actual Durham of the Soul Nest to reconnect with vodka Vaughn and particularly with Bob on here so it's the Dharma in the the most personal
 manifestation of God that won't connect with that so this Dharma this type of Dharma like in other words there might be so many kinds of more fundamental regular dharma's like how
be a good husband how to be a good wife how to be at the coal business person excetera that's all great it's important we should live by that but his bog about Tommy's how do I threw love connect with beautiful sweet baby Christian at the root of all existence and for that you know there's there's there's other practices of Dharma how do I remember him how do I think of him how do I meditate on him how do I serve him
 I text 46 years and chance this narration about the omnipotence of the Supreme personality. Had Vishnu is certainly liberated from Material bonded without fat boom that's your gift for hearing about this narration that wouldn't that still be certainly liberated from Material bondage and again this statement it flies in the face
 of what a lot of Yogi's or a lot of likes Indiana Yogi's Francis might feel right
you're telling me that just by hearing the story
 is it a boy
 I'm just right here in this I'm liberated from Material bondage without fail because I know a lot of you always up for a lifetime practice granny or they would have to renounce the whole world you have to let you know live incredibly lost your lives in order to 22 maybe achieve freedom from bondage to to get multi you're telling me you hear this you hear this narration and you chanted and without fail you got it well at all so people could argue well I just read it not liberated you're wrong like you're in New York you're going to La once they close that door for me to put in your seatbelts it's as good as if you're in La you know what I mean you're not going to get hijacked it but once you're once you're in that door and you're on the plane it's as good so one in other words that Jesus for the bog of a tongue taste for how do you know the taste for the the tear down the Holy Name the Bison upstate
once you get that taste it's as good as being liberated it means your ear in the plane go down there we think about my that's my purple dragon up what you think about that and I appreciate it. Just like two people back in New York and they said will where's Reagan I think he's calling you until they he's in La I'm not actually I'm having flying over Kansas City
 but yeah I'm in La for the most part so you don't get stuck in Scranton Scranton the devotees anyone with great attention here's this narration concerning the activities of prolonged Mirage the killing of around because she pooped and the activities of the Supreme personality. Head-shrinker Dave surely reaches the spiritual world where there is no anxiety
 would that be nice if I come to Honey the water
boiling over the stove worry about it. It'll work itself out the barns on fire I think deal here there's no worry there's no worry I wonder if things go wrong but you just don't have to worry like the barns on fire but I'm just not going to worry about it and he'll take care of us out or if Barnes don't burn in a bit probably like a nice he's going to come back it's going to burn go away and be fine so again we hear the tension and this is real this is real important we have to end on this point today
 hit me up let me by the judge if that as long as you're paying attention I'm happy so again too many yogis this might sound like some kind of exaggeration because isn't hearing these stories that come in the ladder Vedic scripture
do even call it Natick some people would argue these piranhas and it the Hoss's these are like story these are for like less intelligent people these are for like the shooters like that the people that don't really know anyting it's some stories it's not like a serious way down to that you find in upanishads where you practice this Intense or not you tell me just by hearing these stories
 you achieve this you know and and yes that's what the Bible times here to tell you it may sound easy but it works and it works better than anything in the end you know this goes back to bug of agita right what were the 13 chapter Krishna says some perceived the Super Soul within themselves through meditation that means like they are stronger you over you know described in the yoga sutras into you do very demanding freedom in the price of others through the cultivation of knowledge that's Kiana yoga again intense renunciation you don't cold stoic Stark kind of analysis
you know it's it's nothing easy and still others to working without food or desires as karma yoga and then the next races and again there are those who even if they're not conversing in spiritual knowledge even if they're not a brilliant philosopher would but if they begin to worship the Supreme person upon hearing about him from others
