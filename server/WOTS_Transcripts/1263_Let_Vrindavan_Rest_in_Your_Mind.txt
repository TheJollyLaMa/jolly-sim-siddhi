 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Ramin r a t bring David Dum. This is worse than the sage of Sedalia to podcast with your hoe stroganoff and co-host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York welcome to show everybody another beautiful day and bring the oven cuz tubes in my app or all we need now is somebody in jogging up or are we covered all the major go device not bases Mera Mera
 you know it's important I tell you haven't been to India Now's the Time
to hop on one of the trips we do happen to pilgrimage that I do because you know cuz she would we even know what I did I took Mary up her first time on the phone when David program which is what's it like now because you know what it is. Let me give you an example back its get the background first okay so there is no it's called the old cowboy trail that went around the village of random country is like two square miles is 5 x 2 square miles and so it's about a two-and-a-half-hour walk by me and her so I take long I stopped at every day and wondering to temples and stuff like that but the ideas
 you should do in Fat Boy by this you know what there's no competition there's no trophies cuz Scuba
you should have been pretty darn fast but why I'm at me and her man now I'm a ender I stop I read but anyway and it was sort of like eating parts of it were like a road in the old days but most of it wasn't and didn't you know the words a lot of it was just a Sandy Trail rather than a payout exactly wrong with it cars are going on and you know there is a bock the explosion happening right now and like this temples I mean you walk down that path and you realize this is a very religious country it's like every type of vyshnavi and their gurus and they're stacked and they're they have ashrams everywhere sometimes the Astros are no bigger than a Hut and sometimes their massive and you know what me and Mary got to experience yesterday was you know
the palace's you went to the the Queen the king of Bart boar and the queen of Dark Horse Palace on the yamuna case she got and like the Kings from Oliver Rajasthan or money for they would build palace temples and maintain them and then they would go there with their Entourage that was their idea of you know for a New York or having an Upstate have to go to you know they would go to the countryside in the holy town is there time for like a little off-duty I just got my guards here watching me and bring my queen here and we're just going to do Puja and live a spiritual life and you can almost romanticize what it must have been like how beautiful it was so anyway of course Time Marches On and you know what this really reminds me of in the Trader Joe's men's bathroom
 I've never been in the women's bathroom in Trader Joe's and a butt in the men's bathroom
there this is an Albany New York there's a giant picture of where Trader Joe's is from the 1950s and it's like a beautiful Farm like Albany was beautiful Farms where the Albany airport was was a gorgeous Shaker Village and now you'll never know it's a congested strip malls everywhere do the Trader Joe's and the white and so it's sort of like get to India now because the holy places are still going to be there but you're going to have to dig extra deep to find the people places
 temples
 you know it's like a lot of these temples that were tiny little temples and now become massive structures and a lot of the beautiful old Estates by probably wealthy people who also their country houses in for nobbin the land has been purchased and people just get out there
like a land grab and they're just building these things that are just a little protest truthfully and so anyway it's sometimes hard to recognize and I went I went searching for my old Mentor Hari Bhajan. His ashram today I just could not find it because now the whole thing it could even locate locate it couldn't locate it if that's how much things have changed but there were places where like I know exactly where I am like certain things would stand out I know exactly where I am and then other things were like where am I a lot of times the trail has actually shifted a little bit anyway anyway come to vrindavan and these places as soon as you can because when you make a stupid one that which wasn't a long time ago
 In-N-Out
 there was like a one-lane road a one-lane road to get here and now there's two super high
what is leaving up the Beltway around Dale so my question to you was the experience of the oven to punch proche is it like you're out there in the traffic is going by the horns and honking like
 you just see how I like what I had to really you had to really go inside cuz I really want to do my Pooja we could have left a little earlier and before the cars are on the road and you get a little bit more of that but it is Mission breakout it yeah I wrote her that would be the best thing you know what else
 play yesterday when we were out and run Dobbin house was taking surround and he had mentioned Pollies like you know nobody goes hungry and burn David like no monkey no dog no person I know it's like the whole time
going around a country out there just like people offering charge you do free chili to the pilgrims are they do you know there's like for each other's kitchari there's just like sort of tomorrow morning before you guys go he set up a little chai stand for the monkeys only monkeys monkey say
 alright well maybe I'll do that when I get there I'll do that break out at 5 a.m. and you know what I think we're going to do tomorrow sir if you go down to the pickup truck on the phone number Gopi janewale commandeer
 the butt
wherever I got is what's it called the bro I got I think it's called
 where that a bra Temple is on the beginning of the program trailer if you take a right instead of taking a right to take out a laughed and you go to Safari Muniz ashram ever do that one Yeah by Usher I'm in the middle of nowhere sit up there watch the yamuna expressway taking we sat today by the yamuna and we chance if you want us to come it was super nice seeing you guys you like to chance those prayers when you're at home back in and now when you do it you're going to be sitting in brindavanam just by chatting as much as getting your going to be in vain. I agree I agree so it's important to come in contact with these holy places that way when you do chansey's monches you're like oh yes I'm here I'm here again
 really good at school reading and still reading and listening to lives of vyshnavi Cheerios and violation of saints
made this whole part of the this little last final chapter that our trip really sweet like anything trying to find the best chai they're trying to find the best at Lost Sea
 yeah I go in and out of different bring Dobbins street foods
 I do I do this year I am feeling was one of them I got over that then this this year showed her them and I'm looking for an answer right you know tapioca they make a like a fried tapioca what do you call that shoot them like a TV tapioca kitchari you know now I'm going for. You wanna tonight tonight we're going out because my deity
sing I want to Joy Opera Boo or probably do you all that the famous TD Bank I went to him and let you look at the Lurch a tiny at DD's that we both have no not bad him if I never do Chandra I bought it you Mona Prasad around the corner okay cuz I couldn't afford them from him like him straight out it's just like really expensive but then I brought I bought these results when I brought it to him and he made them fine or made all the details no really
 he paints up I guess so I said you paid someone there no he said you Penny goes yes and images very thoughtfully just looked at the any just saying he's telling how he'll paint it and they said this
80 is very old very old and he gave it to us and they said they found this string of DD in the Norman the river now very older than us how the old and you are several lifetimes ago it'll break my heart just hearing this is just a few doors down from there used to be such a nice six fingers and he's not he's no longer there another being a beautiful man here has a rug posses well he have the advantage of that six finger I don't know that six finger help but he had six fingers on each hand it like an extra pinky that can kind of out of the side of his hand
 and I did see him sometimes like I want saw like he would kind of loop that the tape measure through there so he
did have five finger functionality and then an extra tape measure holders it's used by most most skillful. Taylor there in bananas
 yeah you know it's still not too late to make memories come to vrindavan me and the people up in Dobbin go to go over downhill go to rotica and meet these people eat with them glorify and it changes you it changes your practice when you get back home I want to hear phone we are three and he was like it just shows a flower Garland guy that we did that we talked about on the show was wondering if it was actually only talked about this guy is beautiful and his flowers are great
wreaths of Tulsi and yesterday we got two hundred rupees are $3 come on I got a question from Mara Tamara what's it like for you seen many places simmer down for your first time with Reagan. As the tour leader it's wonderful for all the times you've traveled more than go over. That's why I feel like a buy more of an affinity with over downhill that I do with Brenda Robin but you know if I've heard so many stories and we just finished listening to the audio book and there's so many great Randolph and stories that it's like you know I was like all men are we actually going to see her about Jen. Sure you know
what are the things was when we were walking past speaking of like the beautiful beautiful people have been. And we walked past this like you do usually it's like a whole bunch of squatters kind of sitting together on the side but there is a group of women we're probably like in their sixties or seventies sitting and they were just at least one of them was knitting something and singing by John's and just like so joyfully beautiful joyful toothless women teeth between the six of them you know and then just singing and singing I just like why aren't I and I remember in the old days before there was iPhones and easy with I had a big Radio Shack tape recorder and I used to take it around with me and just walk into temples and just record Beautiful Morning Sounds ever Dobbin and it was right you know is very very special these
 these are the things I want to
just in our mind forever we want to remain on did you go to write a reminder we're going to do that tonight because we have to pick up the deity tonight we haven't really gone out at night from crocodile
 yeah I'm going to pick up the DVD from probably I will probably go to write a Ramon and I'm some other secret temples perhaps
 you know what I got from from Prabhu Dayal that you should consider see if he's got it ever see those little brass cows that I have on my altar grass cows are beautiful and that's where I got it I got it I got a great look to the Sierra is Sheila there and be very happy with her every lady a David has those little decorate it was like
and they bring Argo Pieology around put them on their head and then I said thing it's more than ever people are doing that it's like everywhere
 I like in a bad way because there's a lot of control but in a great I mean I went to that Temple that you know you there 6:30 Arctic is the one where they're all the Cure times are going on
 the entire Temple was standing room only practically my poor too and just like hundreds if not thousands just clapping and clapping clapping and lose it look like if I wasn't part of this religion I do like I want to join these guys I don't know what they believe but I believe whatever gives you what they have that's what I want it was like that it was like that that's awesome
 yeah and I told you privately I'm getting messages from people who you and I yeah that was ever work
I always thought we were nuts and cookie or like just like it I really like what you're into I really interested you know each other on Instagram and social media and who in one sense is a very influential person not just him but other people too that you told me that not that I told you about but it may have been other people just like just positive you know cuz it hears a deal don't tell me Billy psycho it's right in to say hey man I never said I was not writing me not Billy psycho yet but you never know
 never know but the thing is the material world a crush has a lot of Romanticism of material life all the things you hope to fulfill your heart don't fulfill you and you're like all your left to do is like become bitter and I get it cuz you can't even get bitter at religion people get bitter and boxy if they had a bad experience but if you can really hold on to the essence of everything 2 by
teaches you don't get bitter you don't get bit or you just need some people have some shortcomings we don't get bitter at Christian and Christians teachings their basketball everybody has a whole wide range of people that are trying their best to you going to meet sincere people you give me some insincere people are going to be people that are like the most mind-blowing sweet-hearted kindest you know opening you up to incredible new notes in your atmosphere that was really disappointing and it's all going to be there the ideas that someone there is in her life to help us figure out how to snip out that that's that connection that's where we're going to thrive you know connected to
 and I always warned people in this is not a sales tactic either don't just go to bring David on your own go with myself or with or with a group of people that are into bhakti cuz you won't get that taste
if you don't get the taste of vrindavan in this lifetime it's an incredible loss and it's in the most it's the work of a bad experience you go there with backpack or check and stuff out of it and that's something weird I got sick and you have a bad experience it's such a bad thing you need to get a taste of Randolph and by somebody who has a taste and I appreciated that today cuz I'm looking at Mara in one sense is it steady like anything but relatively new into all this stuff relatively new and she has a taste for it when I see it she's excited to be a gofer. He's excited to walk Barefoot she's excited to it like go to holy places and that taste has been like given to us and it gets passed down and that that taste is the most valuable thing cuz that's what you want to be meditating on at the time of death let's with and during the times of life
 is it that was a little bit of a Bittersweet day for me here
cuz I'm just really talk is the last time for Lena I've been here came in mid October so it's been four and a half months ago I can that's pretty cool but you've been there for you know it is very yeah and and you know was okay last time going to the ganga saying goodbye to pajari trying to do a few thoughtful things you know give a little here give a little there you know try to make someone happy over here trying to make someone happy over there try to remember something say a prayer of your save her that those kind of things
 they say that you're very edifying
 but it is going to look at the room I'm in right now
 yeah, this is this is my home you know since mid-october and another thing
 you know you when you when you enter into this community about to Yogi's you begin to have friends all over the world in and what a friend Tara is in a just took me in
 he's provided all my meals he's provided my home everything that I need he's just
he's a bill and send me the bill and Aunt you know just been nothing but Pleasant Inn and you know it's one thing to bring someone over for a weekend or we can deny seeing some guy moves into your house for like for four and a half months but he's here this is a real friend you know I am very grateful for people like animals
 yeah yeah my poor friend oven so happy I have them in my life I like I'm like I'm eager to come I'm not even left yet I mean you're going to come back that's how I feel right now another thing that I feeling is now I'm going to I'm going to Reesha keishin 15 years
 you know the first time very long time and that like we're staying at the end of the show yesterday I don't know if I made it on the recording but I don't know where I'm going I don't you know I know someone there is going to take care of me but I don't know if I'm sleeping on the floor I don't know if you know what I mean that it's
nice sometimes to just put yourself in God's hands and accept what comes you know and open yourself up for the experience so that's how I go now to to rishikesh I'm really looking for you on there looking for you going to bring the oven after that I'm going to be in the jungle
 it's nice and cold do some women with breathing before you get in there cuz it's cold and blue this time of year now announcements to do some excited for you we had lunch with this morning with initiative or you know what happened he was visiting here and he said who I need to talk to you I heard your podcast yesterday
excitement about from David and the story about Lala Babu that if you miss the store yesterday Lala ba bo is was a very wealthy businessman in Calcutta who grew up a devotee of this is like in the 1800's you grew up in the booty but you only got into big business he started stop thinking about a spiritual life and then one day he was standing on the steps and floor sweeper woman he was standing right in front of the sweeper one woman in the Super Woman said move along the Sun is setting time to go like move out of my way so I can sweep I have to go to bed I have to finish my job but when he heard that because of those some scars as a child he's like move along the Sun is setting this is my this is God talking to me and he sold his business or gave everything away built a beautiful Temple and Brenda Robin and laughed and retired and dining room table and so anyway
see who we've known since I've known since I joined the temple is a disciple is Marco thrush Swedish to go to you'll ever meet and I never knew this but it looks like it's 40 years old and he's 77 years old and he and I didn't know this but he said oh yeah I meant probably out in 1967 made chapatis at 26 2nd Ave and I was like you're kidding but he goes yeah I'll let you know I had one I had it he had an experience that he said I am turning to God it was an atheist and turning to God and then he met the devotees but he got it ended up getting to Maharishi for many years and became sort of a big big teacher with Marucci but then he got very attracted to back to bhakti later I heard your
can you talk about Lalu Babu in the Sun is setting and I thought
 this is me Sun is setting I'm not in a clinically ill or chronically sick or in a I'm going to die at any time that I know of the doctor has a pronounced anything but the Sun is setting in my life who am I kidding and I'm really thinking I'm just not going to leave and Ava now and it was it was you know it is beautiful it is beautiful too
 you know here these people here is people like lale Babu and like ledeni Shakti who hear these statements and you we hear the mule and I hear them but it is like the puzzle piece right now and then it's like yep now I've been hearing this I've been entertaining this thought in my mind but now I'm going to act out I'm going to pull the trigger I was always sort of like ready
and I never pulled the trigger on anything and I'm going to pull the trigger all the stuff that we talked about going to a regular basis all the stuff we talked about the regular basis guess what some of us we got to really pull the trigger with that and we got to figure out what that trigger we got to pull the trigger pull sometimes you got to pull the trigger and we've been holed it off we just still a man not me I got time
 now may I pull the trigger on the takeaways
 all right but today we have our class code of Cain Asana for Patriot members at 10:30 a.m. eastern online back to Recovery Group meetings at 12:30 and 1 and in-person be achieving this evening

 are you going to call the Nugget
 let's go in about an hour and I'll use the Nugget in the bottle of time
 who's the Nugget used don't let the Nugget use you you use the Nugget in here yeah the rain in the musketeer on that I'm driving or Altima
 there's a delay before I said that she was never a means of Conquest when should a speckled obeisances to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reissue the super most human being and two other saraswoti the goddess of learning and then she'll be off today of the author
Facebook Corporation in Schaumburg at 7 a.m. and I really seriously. But he's all that is troublesome to the heart located the Supreme Lord was praised with Transit the songs we established as a radical of fact that's why she could have been in my heart I was born the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge
 Mill Basin sees that Lotus feet reading Russia my Bible time
 Kansas 7 chapter 5 text 25 mr. K we just lost your camera right now
 should I read the nugget nugget yeah
 all right yeah okay
with me read that I'll be very happy about that
 play the Nugget
 you know who Alexander Graham. Sure you had a lot of wise things to say
 yeah well he made Bell Telephone Bell Laboratories I mean person that kind of invented the telephone the maven other people that are everybody created it you know it's like a mad race war who's been invented first got the patent for today
 so this is what he says we're not and we're going to relate this to bhakti we're going to relay it to the bar with time and I think we can relate this to you and Mara Kennedy moonasa Life
 at at the Safari Mooney's restaurant I think we can relate this to our dear
Lamborghini Shakti parole hearing your your talk about you know the Sun is setting time to move on and it dropping into his Consciousness in a way that touched his heart and moved him to accelerate is a spiritual life
 Alexander Graham Bell says concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand
 the sun's rays do not burn until brought into a focus like when you have a magnifying glass can burn leaves you know being of light focused beam of light so are mine this is the way you always think this is why a lot of wise people have thought for centuries that you know I care
 I can't control the results of my activities
that but what I can do is I can focus my mind on what I'm doing and then be detached right and in yoga is so much about that Focus
 the different practices that we do now we're in the midst of a of a couple of verses spoken by prologue when his father asked him the question question number three in this chapter is father said what was the best thing you learn in school today again you know what have you learned and he named nine different meditative practices write all related to all designed specifically
 remembering and and fostering devotion for Lord Krishna Lord Vishnu but we should understand that these aren't just like random religious
 actions are random religious customs
 but the meditative practices that are
design by great sages you know in order to bring the mind to focus our thoughts to concentrate our thoughts
 on on the most captivating and powerful force that of Sri Krishna the origin of all existence that's what's happening so when we heard trouble hearing your hearing about him you know kirtan immuno chanting about him smart I'm remembering him these are just like the sun rays when they're focused you know they burn when we begin to take our tension with just wanders everywhere is looking for all kind of ridiculous people to focus on a ridiculous events to get captivated by a silly nonsensical ridiculous ridiculous you know unimportant stuff that captivates us unimportant you know we got to pull it in and focus of right where is going to be like a
need a burn you know in that will burn away all of them lifetimes of impressions in the mind of all of that nonsense and burn away all our desires that that do us harm that distract us from experiencing our own true Blissful devotional spiritual love which is in that soon as our nature it's going to burn away all that extra stuff for loud Mirage he started from Narda
 in an artist heard it from her mama mama got it in a seed like form from Lord Vishnu this is the group grand prize being handed down and now provided is fluffing it out you know he's kind of like expanding on it here and there it is positively to record sit in in Bob of time so that we can learn about these different pass proper comments
 and you'd like to add some thoughts are going to want to do what you got to say
 I can't hear my son's going through the back of the butt
and you're a little chop testing yeah okay go ahead Perry Krishna or internet connections we can you hear me yes
 Canary brother yes yes so the idea the idea of the magnifying glass that I really got to fine-tune it to make it useful or do what it needs to do to be like a laser and burn something our minds are like that we're the scattered mine is so ineffective and I was thinking about sometimes it takes like I'm trapped in a burning building or I'm like in the 100 first floor of nine in a during 9/11 the thing is bursting into flames what is it going to take what type of disastrous thing is going to take for me to actually realize Krishna I need you that desire Krishna I need you I need you now that urgency
and that's what we have to practice when things are don't appear or urgent
 when things appear like everything's fine it's a beautiful sunny day today perfect weather not too cold not too hot that's when we have to chant like we're about to jump out of the window of a burning building like Krishna I need you so desperately we have to feel that desperation if you don't practice it while things are okay you're not going to have it even when things get tough your mind will be distracted you know and I know it's it's a real thing it's a real thing it's easy to be distracted even when it's like you're dying
 I mean I remember gopal Chandra who I think had an incredibly auspicious leaving his body but I was with him when he was dying of cancer and released his body was dying and I watched him also being distracted and I said hey come back let's
put that aside focus focus this is this is what we've been training for our whole life every time you pick up your beads every kirtan you went to every time you chanted oh man your yoga class we've been practicing this for our entire life and so if we don't get that type of pain this is the beauty about bhakti we are really really fine tuning it like a laser so in the course of success Good Fortune beautiful family when everything seems so Rosy that's when we have to be in our heart A desperate Krishna I need you so bad today never let go of that desperation ER that's what I'm doing all right that's what you're saying it reminds me of a bob with Tom verse
 and I pulled up a commentary from vishwanath chakravarthi talk we're on this verse 2
spoken you know it's really interesting the bottom of time you know the first two chapters lay out a lot of important thoughts that get expanded upon throughout the bar with Tom and important theological and philosophical conception and then we begin to hear about we begin to hear there's chapters that explain to us how the bar with Tom came about why it came about what is it specifically it's a dressing
 and that takes us like to up to chapter 7 and then it comes to chapter 8 in from this point on for the rest of the first cancelled is really setting us up is all kind of one setup but it's the chapters from 8 until I forget how many chapters in the first candy made like 16 or some of that
 all these chapters are building us up to the introduction Mirage. Right who will be the person to ask the question that gets to go swimming and speak the rest in the Box
so when in chapter 8
 it almost feels like the first time it turns into a story we start to hear the story stories you know and it opens up with the prayers
 it's like after the battle of kurukshetra you know you just here has been made King excetera excetera
 and Christians ready to leave hastinapur and leave the pound of us you know and and that's heartbreaking and the entire city is out Christmas on a chariot everybody's simultaneously captivated by by seeing him and at the same time we anticipate in the separation from him
 and 20 comes out right here is crunchy right this glorious woman
 who's gone through so much struggle in life and now finally her family has been established back in her sons are now the Kings
you know after you know like a inconceivable battle that is somehow one by krishna's grace and how Christians getting on the Chariot and he's about to go in a corset that time she says a famous verse you know all the calamities that have happened in our lives let them happen again and again because when those calamities come I get that focusrite everything that magnifying glass get get situated just right I'm focused on you and when I remember you I'm not distracted and I'm remembering you that I no longer see birth and death I transcend the temporary dualities of this world this is another verse that comes for the afternoon
 beautiful scene right
 a beautiful scene and and it is the whole body of a Time truthfully is 11 Royal Calamity after another it deals with the halves it deals with
gajendra the king of the elephants it deals with property and queen County it's true of all Roy to you know it's interesting because we have this idea of privilege and it's a huge thing of white privileged male privilege or guess what rivers does it why is why is well the old why is well the only metric of what privileges you know like we measure there's wealthy people who are miserable is it they might have a leg up and they can they can have more stuff
 but they could just be equally as miserable or have a horrible parents are have a horrible upbringing just because they have some money we have a different idea a different metric of what real privilege if you're born into a family of devoted
spiritual parents that's the highest thing you can have and we also say that even if you're not you can you can you can say you know what now I want it and you see this and that's a beautiful thing I paid with vaishnavism is
 climbing the economic ladder is so secondary to climbing the ladder for your spiritual Soul your souls Liberation because you see people who have nothing and they're destitute and they have 16th and M in Singing in Bliss
 exactly just like the store and run this phone is broke and Coby John of Alaba and go down the shop or the doorway
 he sleeps in the doorway in New York Times articles about like women of Randolph and I saw something like that I was like
horrible living in destitution guess what destitution is relative destitution compared to who to us living in a condo sitting in and in some kind of in a hospital at the end of her life or sitting in alone on a old folks home that where she gets no company a note to self with M perhaps who doesn't care about you know I'm not a blood relative or something like that when you're when you're bonded by God and and you've been studying your whole life that actually there's nobody but this Krishna it's actually quite beautiful it's actually quite beautiful culture
 how can I read my voice right now it's ready from Queen of Hearts sold them by Queen Quincy to krishna's is on the chair and about to go I'm says taim a Nunya Vishal metier mud to but a secret rotten avocado
come on beti
 let my mind
 with attention fixed on no other object
 repeatedly carry its affection to you the chief of the motor Dynasty just as the ganga the river ganga carries its full strength of water to the ocean
 really. It's another it's it it's another it really does
 what does the ganga getting your mind flowing in One Direction she said cuz you know she says that she should the previous first you said let my family affections be broken my family ties right which sounds like a very Guiana kind of less about to push more organic approach right like sure
your whiskey and analyzing that my relationships are temporary and they're unreal and I want us to break so that I'm no longer in ignorance and have become free but the commentary by vision of a chocolate bar chocolate kind of expands on that he writes
 it is says in response to the previous thing where she was saying break my ties for my relatives
 he writes a question then do you want realization of Brahman is that what you want is you want this impersonal realization isn't personal Liberation because if you cut off your affection for the out of us if you caught off your affection for your family members you will cut your affection for me also
 okay cuz Christian has her relative
 and so then the here's the response made my mind hold affection ready for you without any obstacle
advice means to flow strongly the Mind should not think of anything else your devotees
 are not different from you and that's without affection for them affection for you cannot take place this is the body understanding
 if someone's do to you than they do to me if I can't I can't think of you without thinking of them thinking of them means thinking of you because we're also tied together with connections of love so I so she says again your devotees are not different from you she talked about her own relatives now your devotees are not different from you and that's without affection for them affection for you cannot take place it is not possible that this could please you my losing my faction for your devotees who are my relatives therefore let my mind have a traction for No One
except you and your devotees attraction not saying
 even love but this is where my interest this is where my heart goes right and especially
 I pray to cut the affectionate bonds with a pond of his ignjatovic I prayed to cut the affectionate bonds with a pond of his in the yard of his who are your devotees but since it is a prayer in front of you
 it means cutting only the material affection which it arises from bodily identification it is not the cutting of affectionate relation with you you got that yeah I want cut out of my mind my the aspect of my connection with my family members that's illusory that's based simply on the vibe door but I want to increase the affection that I feel for them that's in relation with you
 I want to cut that if
action which causes bondage
 just as the ganga carries a full stream of water to the ocean the shelter of small and large rivers
 may my mind also carries affection to you
 for the shelter of all the devotees just as the ganga does not consider any obstacles on its course my mind also should not consider any obstacles that may arise while thinking of you
 nice huh me like he be like you that I too like that again you and me are sitting there on the bank of the mooner reading you more gnostica
 enjoying it and enjoying each other's company and that affection that you feel free to other is in no way a hindrance as a matter fact it's helpful because it's in really cuz they
is what we do together right this is what we do we remember Christian remember umona relate was related to Christian this is what we do together those bonds are bonds that are pleasing those bonds bonds theater cuz how we get that phone cuz it's a dual system isn't it it's like our own effort we just okay let's do this instead of doing something else sure and then it's Grace right that we're not these great you always but Christmas you know recognizing the effort that end in feeling merciful grants us the Consciousness for sure yeah and so when you go back to New York and you're up in Upstate New York land that
 could be seen as having no relation to vrindavan your Channing those same vibrations that you chanted are and you're vibrating on the van. And level you're vibrating in the same Consciousness as you were when you were there in Grenada
and it's in so that's why I'm saying what we're hearing from valad about Trevor and Kirsten and business one of the nine practices of bhakti they're not just like religious rituals
 meant to appease the god or something like that they're their practices of meditation very factive practices of concentrating the mind but in a very pleasing way in a very satisfying way to a very aesthetically pleasing way
 that's what we doing about it
 it sounds when you wake up in the middle of the night Amanda because people sometimes wake up super early you know
 they're just like wild sounds out this window you'll hear people chanting mantras and screaming and singing and dongs and peacocks it's just like nonstop sound okay I got a question for you tell me so all those years ago back in the late 80s early 90s when we used to
around 4 not going to be morning
 as you would approach the emunah river there is always that one person sitting in a little hot chatting remember that I brought that in my book as well speaker in Vern Dobbin the moon and they were just chant non-stop 24
 and they switched with a switch they switch to
 sitaram sitaram sitaram
so are they still there that's my question. I was just thinking about them today and see if they're not they're not there I got the seasons dead They're All Dead you know what I mean most likely I mean I'm running into Rick's drywall guys were waving to me and I don't you remember I was 8 years old I was like oh my God I remember driving. Do you remember that after you after you would go through case you got, come around go to the town a little bit and then just before you get to the Juggernaut Temple do you do 1/4 you have to turn and there were these vicious dogs like really vicious dogs they went by the yes I do I was chased by those I would carry stick the entire time just because I knew when I get to that corner I need a mistake on the ground in the dogs kind of high bang the stick on the ground went to the snapped and then they all
just ran but I will say this we went by that y'all going to Temple today we went by there we went into the you know where they do the the wrestlers and the other place about the wrestlers the wrestling gym outdoor gym and then the that still there and that other ashram there where this house Andy
 yeah yeah
 that place is incredible what's it called again stubborn David everyday to cover the bodies with the dust of an almond
 we saw a guy go over Dunhill approached like no one was on the trail practically there's a guy in a dhoti and no shirt on and he's just like poor like you look like you was actually washing himself with the with the burn David us and we just had dreads
think about those who take the dust on their bodies we just read that it's like he's taking a bath and scrubbing himself on his hair and his face and I was like this he was very serious this man this man you took it to a new level like he might have to
 yes do you think that he cared at all for public opinion as he was doing
 I don't think he was doing it to impress us we need to think I'm cool yeah I know now I don't know he didn't say he was in his own Beauty there
 and it's you see people like that a covert on Randolph and they're just in that they're in their own world and like the whole
world has stopped for them
 that's a beautiful place to be in the 80 and truthfully it's like
 after a year of being single after my marriage
 I was thinking oh my go to be a senior see how I'm going to be a bond a process and is it like I'm putting out in Saffron or something or am I going to get married again or something and I thought I got to this point we're like I don't think I'm going to be it's not going to help me in my body and I think this is what we have to always look for what will help me in my body and to have a partner helps me in my body that doesn't mean I can lean in to Mara or my partner as my God but it means that you do things together that are connected to body you know so it's sort of still I still have children some raising my kids and I'm working in the world but our Recreation that we enjoy is our body and and
next important thing it's important thing so we all have these duties of the material world and then we have these like deeper duties but ultimately it is just me and God Mara and God cuz scuba and God and no one's going to save us from that we have to really become determined and be a you know what
 I need you Christian I need you in my life so bad please come to me and it has to be our personal petition to Lord Krishna to Radha and Krishna to develop that broad bhakti at it desire to be in love with Cristiano in the devotees and there is that desire that we get and then there also is that extended hand that Krishna gives a Grace that Krishna gives to you know that verse that you you mentioned about bathing in the dust smearing the dust yeah
 that's that's in this chapter that were reading and that's it's and it's the response to the 4th question we're running kashyap
I'll ask I'll provide he'll say you rascal most Fallen of our family if you had not received this education from your teachers where have you gotten it
 and I was just read this this is a few verses but you get to that first one verse two that did we have time because of their uncontrolled senses persons to addicted to materialize business philosophy and his father people to these different Horton versus people to addicted you know when Lord Chiltern you would hear this through dominar goes fine with read it to him and he would just say read it again read the whole chapter again read the whole chapter double it because of their Uncle Joe Sansone person's addicted to materialistic life make progress towards hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which is already been chewed very important
their inclinations toward Crystal never Rouse either by the instructions of others by their own efforts of our combination of both persons who are strongly and trapped by their consciousness of enjoying material life and what they're for accepted as their leader or grew a similar blind man attached the external sense objects cannot understand the goal of life and it's true and that cannot understand that the goal of life is to return home back to got it and engaging the loving service of Lord Vishnu as a blind men Guided by another blind man missed the right path in fall into a ditch materially attached men led by another material attached man are bound by the road to fruit of Labor which are made of very strong cords and they continued again and again and materialistic life suffering the threefold miseries unless
 unless they send me your upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet
vaishnav is completely freed from Material contamination person's very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to low speed of a lord who is glorified for his uncle activities only by becoming Krishna conscious and taking shelter low speed of a Lord in this way it won't be freed from Material contamination we got was meditating on when they're doing that right you know we shouldn't have to show Monday with that verse
