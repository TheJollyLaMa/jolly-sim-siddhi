 first of all there's an assassination attempt in this week over this weekend president United States was talked about that before we go there to mention that you know we interviewed the one of the most promising violinist of her generation yesterday yeah how'd that go Alexandra tears to otherwise we know her as a friend Barcelona Priya
 wow I mean you know the realization is a lot of it had to do with discipline cuz we can talk a lot about
disappointed she was like describing that bike from a little while she's like a little girl
 she go to school then she practice hours and hours of gymnastics
 then she'd have dinner then our mother would like driller and getting a violin for Mike a p.m. until like midnight or 1 in the morning that was her life in a while and I and you you know so she really has a lot of experience and thoughts about self-discipline and what it takes and what it gives you what he delivers
 and then but you know she said she she took that and then she you know when she was 15 or 16 or some she just kind of wandered into the brand new Temple in Moldova
 and she was just so moved by by the devotees and the philosophy and the food and everything that she just became a devoted that age still carrying on these disciplines and you know she just kind of with the boy
things of of devotees like butter hyper blue and rodner Swami Narayan Swami you know she followed that career as a musician and she's risen up to the highest levels of it but you know she was also described that that's a real it's a real shoes or toxic you know but it's a real competitive World in it you know when you're working that hard yeah and you're not getting everyone's competing for like one seat while they're all working hard it's not like the other ones are slacking off eating popsicle so they're like oh that's my point if you're working that hard and you're not getting the spot that you want you can drive you crazy and I can draw the lower nature out if you and there can be a lot of backbiting and a lot of rumor-mongering and a lot of you know a lot of a lot of tension is underneath that and she was just driving how it was the philosophy of Krishna bhakti
 that really gives her the prospective you be able to move through such a high tension toxic difficult you know
environment that was nasty Orchestra people hang out with those ballerinas forget it Woodwinds and dancers timpani huh so anyway it's a great interview to check it out I think people find it if she still has some really great insights you know yesterday I did some of that I've wanted to do a long time but it took someone else's sense of compassion and duty at 2 to Cana
 get me off my butt and get me on a train to New Jersey and that was to go visit bucket Louis
 it's about to lose one of our oldest listeners and not only that he was only one of the seed people getting Krishna Consciousness into hardcore he signed for a band
very influential in Minco students time and then he joined the show before it was the official podcast when it was still Super Soul sacred Tsonga and we he was a regular talker you always say okay let's unmute back to Lily about to Lewis have this great New York City type of boys like you all the blessings on me and it was just he was always just a great refreshing part of the morning matter fact that's one reason why don't we do this podcast on Zoom cuz we have such have such colorful characters and sometimes you like to unmute them so go ahead and tell us what happened was so try to be pretty otherwise known as the jewel of Harlem we call her here and she's with us this morning she you know Louis apparently he was in a hit-and-run bike accident bicycle and that happened like nearly
a long time ago and he spent months in a coma
 and we didn't even know where he was exactly the sex was very hard to trace him down in front of see if she went through so serious she kind of did the detective work to find him locate him get permission to go visit him and now she you know she lives in Manhattan
 she goes every week every every Sunday she goes to visit him if he's like I Tsum he's like paralyzed from the head down like from the neck down cuz I didn't see him move his body except for his head
 the entire time and he's just stuck there you know he's unconscious or he's conscious he's like he was his eyes broken no there's no talkin whatsoever I don't know if you recognize this who we are or not it's hard to tell
 you know he's he's he's trapped there's a soul
trapped inside a body that's some
 dysfunctional at this point you know and so she has her along with to my old friend you know I knew Louis one is 15 years old and two other guys that I knew from the same scene came with me one was the case for Eric Casanova who's the original singer of the chromax
 one was a giant are John Watson who's original singer of Agnostic Front that I go back with again back to like 19 81 82 83 and so we all got together and the four of us took the train out there it's going to be pretty just let me get all his friends together and bring him out there you know how paid for the train for for those guys brought us all out there indoor to our Relentless Reminiscing on the train back and forth and she heard some wild stories you tell me some really wish I was a fly on that wall hearing your stories
are the people we know who the places we've been and I but you know that we walked in there and immediately I can see what an angel she is compassion she has to just walk in there and show a genuine care infection and compassion and dumb
 and you know we sat down we played some profile cheer town and sang along and kind of like how to cure town in the room with him
 and then she said yes it was a great suggestion want you reading bug of agita so we just took out the beginning to start I was at first I was just reading about to get to vibration you realize how special
 the vibration of the bug of agita is it's not an ordinary sound this is the again this is the breathing of of God you know this is the song of God this is when you read it it's not only operating on the intellectual level it's it's it's it's spiritual sound and we all felt that I read for a while John to read for a while
I think at that time
 maybe we felt him like responding you know like something was going on in there was like yes give me this you know I need this so you know it's a little bit more in the eyes so it's been a bit of a response
 a was very sad for me you know to see a friend like that just so helpless trapped inside that body what this world will do to you if you know it's it sound randomly tell errantly Randy earlier and of my hand and it's almost like you must walk out of there like why what's this for how is this helping it is in a quick and quick reflection it seems like it has happened for you maybe the shopping for Jonathan pretty to for her to develop that compassion and that of that warm loving heart maybe these tragedies helping happen
for us to become better for us to grow for us to learn to love again it's hard to love when there's almost like no reciprocation persons of the coma it's hard to show up and be right girl to be pressed in when a person's giving you nothing back so to speak yeah you know and I tell you something when I'm in situations where I see caretakers like that people that take care of people and circumstances that hospital workers people to take care of people with different kinds of disabilities and so on you know I tend to be I recognize my own arrogance my own Pride my child like when I see people that what the speak of people that sound like trying to do it you know we work hard we got those long work hours you got your weekend most you were like this is my weekend in my time to enjoy my time to relax and give it to take the better part of your day
 you know take the whole thing cuz it's about 6 hours you know to go and spend some time with someone sitting alone
it's got no one there for them you've been sitting alone for months and I'm going to do this every weekend you know that or what they speak of people that do it for a living and insight tell what you know right wiping the drool off someone's mouth and just coming in with positive energy and I got a really bomb I had two people like that they do that kind of service I mean it's really something so it it's a day inspired me to help me understand who better who I am and who I'm not
 so anyway that was heartbreaking that weathers it was a heartbreaking experience but there was something beautiful about it to getting together with my old friends and going out and trying to show some love to an old friend and it was nice to it's a reflective going into any
 a critical care situation isn't it when you go in there and you see why so many people are suffering here yeah you walk away with a lot of that deep reflection then everything was the assassination attempt to know
looks like
 if you know it makes people feel like
 we're spinning out of control
 our world is falling apart that got those kind of feelings people have witches the fact is it's always like that. Don't forget that we're a little drop of water on a on a waxy Lotus leaf that could just so you know drop at any moment that's that's this me to our world but I was thinking that you know people have such polarized feelings about the president now about anyone who's against him anybody that's for him fact is we need to and then we're going to read a bit about this and Bobby time today to you know we need to
 feel like feel a sense of friendship or kinship
 with every living being that's where this practice is meant to take us we need to say
 Donald Trump I wish you the best
 if we don't have to waste that is price
I wish you the best you know person that shot Donald Trump I wish you the best you know you know we need to in our heart not bear animosity towards because we've let our hearts become so hardened because we've allowed ourselves to normalize hatred for another living being we we beat that we begin to spin out of control and we begin to harm one another and we inflict pain on one another and you know it's in the name like in the name of Peace in the name of the name of Peace righteousness so you know what it whatever something we all got to move through and try to transcend as we move through it
 the Cruel World Festival it is outside this morning in the grass and I heard some animal getting murdered in the forest you could just screaming for his life and never
sound like a turkey getting killed or a fox getting killed it was something but it was like I've never heard this sound is none of my animals and I was like yep there's some other suffering going on out there everywhere good morning everybody happy Monday Monday
 alright finally Reeboks on that's our shelter you know keep keep this transcendental sound going keep reflecting on his trews keep allowed to enter into and take up the challenge of you know stretching stretching yourself a bit out of the comfort zone and learn how to do all we all need to learn how to take care to love to be compassionate you know take it to the next level this world dies around you okay Ryan on the musket
chaveta wrote them on before she means of Conquest what should offer respectful of base is used to this supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Rishi the super mushy would be today of the author not stop probably a show about race Unity locate a bubble tea in a sticky a regular tennis in class in the Box on a service to the pier to Goldie's all of this Troublesome the heart will become erratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transmit the songs will be established that's in a revocable fact check student has my history I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes for the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their load of speed
read it for the shoe my bag but I'm kin to seven chapter 13 text one beginning of a new chapter today this is an exciting chapter of Anna so we we've heard in-depth about
 the codes for Brahma Cherry like that we're here in the four stages of life right
 would we have to nugget today to maybe just hold on to the Nugget for tomorrow that nugget sir but we heard in-depth about the codes of living for the brahmacharya for the celibate student Monk
 we heard a little bit about the grihastha life married life then we heard more in-depth to get about the vine oppressor like the retired life
 today we begin a whole chapter that deals with seniors like the full renunciation right though that you become a Wanderer
 you know a Drifter of zoroaster address
a great name for a chapter the behavior of a perfect person cuz now you've let go of everything but I think we need to always
 you know there's also many spiritual traditions in religions and we all know that so often they disappoint us or the people that practice them disappoint us they don't seem to embody the essence of what it's all about if someone's deeply religious shouldn't they be kind shouldn't take you no care about everyone shouldn't it happen that show it sometimes seems like they're just condemning everyone that judgmental
 there's always an Essence there's there's different kind of regulations rules think that you know ethics put forward
 but they're all mentally too deep spiritual insights and we always have to make sure that we're working towards that and uncover
not now when they talked about the brahmacharya life it did gave all these strict regulations but then it it showed where it's meant to go what you're meant to realize
 and I'll read what that said back Intex 15 from chapter 12 it said you don't having practice all these austerities one should realize that in the fire
 in the spiritual Master the guru
 in oneself and in all living entities in all circumstances and conditions the Supreme personality guided Vishnu has simultaneously entered and not entered he's there in one sense and he's beyond what sensor is situated externally and internally as the full control of everything one was always realize the all-pervading presence of the Supreme Lord for in this way it is possible to understand the absolute truth okay then we heard about the Vana Presto this you know this like now you're hitting your fifth
senior you don't have to work in the world anymore you were tired and we read about like this person lives in the force for like either 12 or age or two or one years and the pricing is austerities and then we heard at the end of the last chapter about this meditation that they going to and we can picture that like there's a guru guiding them into how to do this where they kind of
 they mentally
 you know we we prepared uses this I don't think it's proper to imagine if you took it from earlier I don't even know straight out of the Sacred texts and commentaries to them but that you want to explain that analogy with the the coconut and the charge the dried coconut
 coconut and the dried coconut what was that day that you know the inner side part of the coconut
he on the coconut you extract the economy in other words for the in the Coconut but not of the coconut any longer if you have a coconut on the inside there's a movie called the meat of the coconut you know the answers part that you eat and it's you know it's it clings to the Shell of the coconut very tight it's sometimes hard to get off when you crack it open to get that coconut off you know you can't wear that thing like I said sculpture something they do you know that I just his own yeah but if you drive that coconut than even without opening it up
 the inside of the coconut kind of shrinks you know and it detaches itself from the shell so you could shake the coconut and you can hear that the inside is still within the coconut was holding a pageant but separately so it stands alone within and so this was a meditation this pain to press you can do after doing all these austerities work
well we would have sense
 what what is what he described was you analyze all the different elements that make up your body and then within you offer all those elements within your body like the watery part of your body you offered back into the water of nature or to the to the demigod the god of that water you you offer it back and you offer her back you know the Earth of your body back into the Earth and the air of your body back into the air like this and then even your senses the sense of sight is offered to the I believe it was to the sun and the sense of hearing is offered you no like you everything that makes up your body
 internally you offered all back it's not mine I'm not attached to it I don't identify so that you can be like that coconut you're still inside your body
 but you stand alone detach from it and so we we read about that like how how the Devon
I can do that and it through meditation and then it said what all material designations have just emerged into the respective material elements
 the living beings who are all ultimately completely spiritual having nothing to do with all those material elements being one in quality with the Supreme Being
 should cease for material existence as flames cease when the wood in which they're burning is consumed when the material body is returned to his various material elements only the spiritual being remains that spiritual being is Brahmin spiritual energy and is equal and quality with Potter Broman her with God so walking that's where all those are stairs a mentally that's where that's what you meant to get from this I'm totally detached I'm seeing God and everything like that this is the essence that were meant to understand through the regulations now we're going to read about the regulations of the senior see the person that now that you're you seen God everyone you're so detached
from your body disassociated with it but although in it now you start to wander and as you've wandered and wandering you know the famous you know even not only that the Eastern thinkers know this but even that's popular around Western saying is a rolling stone gathers no Moss not all Wanderers are lost the Grateful Dead people who came up with that one but the truth yes them are in other words you don't develop the attachments that people that are living in home developing family following their occupation you know that the potentially The Wanderer remains detached and can through deep reflection can develop still deeper understanding so we start to read about that today
 chapter 13 behavior of a perfect person your sex 1
shinar demoney said a person able to cultivate spiritual knowledge should renounce all material activities material connections and merely keeping the body inhabitable merely keeping it in habitable he should travel from one place to another passing only one night in each village Village I'm pretty cool that's a system in this way without dependents in regard to the needs of the body the Sania C should travel all over the world yes like you do they have these regulations because it's like say you are this Wanderer
 and you're accepting whatever got presents to you in the way of the people that you come across right like some day you may go hungry there's nobody there to give you any food there's nobody there to give you any shelter
 and then the next day people may say all wow look at this renuncia it's so it's my dharmik duty to care for them I admire them
let me give them all Comforts and so they take you into the your home and you're sleeping on you know it in in a comfortable circumstances are providing delicious food for you and your you might think I'll let me spend a few days here I know you got to get up this type of to pass right of austerity that people voluntarily take on they're all meant to get us detached from The Real World in more attached to God and in that way so it like God will provide God will provide and you feel this you feel this I am being taken care of now it's safe to say we've all been in a place where we sort of had nothing had nowhere to go perhaps we always feel a little bit like that's where the magic happens in our sort of
 sort of destitution your left to your left to lean into nothing else but God
 variant weather at Emagine wreck that manifest when you're when you're alone
sometimes you left alone sometimes when you there's a sense of loss or this a loss of a loved one or loss of money or of a loss of a circumstance that you felt was important for your well-being or Comfort or whatever yeah you know those times that they couldn't be the real something can really happen when you voluntarily impose those times on yourself sure you mean you're you're you're saying I want to open up to that I want to I want it I want that to be dynamic in my life all the time I mean before before I was
 what the heck before I was even a devotee of Krishna
 I think you mean part of the touring with the band and Saatchi suits as our manager and you know traveling around we really we parked it was God but we trusted we trusted in a concept of God yeah because back then when he's going towards like
he had no money we don't have any money we had no food we had no there was like a dependents like it will work out don't know if we have enough gas to fill up the tank after this we don't know if anybody's going to come to the show or pass any money we don't know where we're going to travel place that not having any idea where we're going to sleep and we had no money for hotels back then she was there was there was like a like a trust okay we're doing something good we think what we're doing is good and whatever you define God has the universe built there will be some reciprocation and he actually feel Magic Mike magic things are happening you meet the right person they take give you shelter they give you some food and it almost seems like wow my my life is divine
 and you know it's like it's so insensitive to the seniors who sang I want to open myself up to that magic but then the thing is it'll always test you though right cuz it's like one
I have that romantic notion but then you find I'm alone
 I don't feel magic right now and end and you really have to go within you know that is the magic that were talking about 2 and you know like
 well as I know is I've gotten older where I I don't travel without credit cards I don't travel without knowing Zach might my itinerary is completely laid out
 you sort of leaned into whatever beer you know American Express card or your you know we'll get it done but still you still get lessons from that when you apply bhakti to everything you'll get lessons from that too because okay here's my flight my flight was cancelled there's no other flight you think you can control now and you still can't control I remember feeling that a little bit I think I misspoke about on the show earlier this year when
you know my trip to India I spent five months in Indian or first I go to the home of my friend Tara everything is provided for me there yeah then we went to the Golden Eagle Village everything is provided for me there but then I just took this trip to
 rishikesh first to Calcutta and then to reschedule and it was kind of just like I don't have time for yourself I don't know if I'm going to eat I don't know what kind of circumstances I don't know if I'm sleeping on the floor I don't I don't know what it is and it felt it felt really nice to kinda and her back into that kind of world we're Krishna you leave me and I accept whatever you provide and that's the life of the cic I'm wandering and whatever he provides except
 and if you raise your standard like I'll only eat krishnaprasad say or I will only whatever you raise your standard to you'll get a reciprocation of that standard you if you
fuel level low standards you'll get a reciprocal pacification with that sin is it just happens if you know what I want and laughing cuz that I'm just thinking now cuz as soon as I started that I went to Calcutta I visited that the old adanga that the the temple were prepared met his Guru yeah and then they arranged for me to get a ride back to the hotel that we're staying at in there like a we're going to call an Uber for you and I said Okay Christian is arranging it over for me they said that motorcycle motorcycle and they have that the grungy is looking helmet of all time some guy on a motorcycle tells me to put put on the helmet and I'm here I am sipping on a motorcycle with some guy I've never met some Brandon Indian Motorcycle to go wrong
motorcycle helmets have to be like updated every 5 years as well because they lose their ability to protect the skull is all the stuff in the motorcycle that hardens up every 5 years have become on Calcutta probably hardens up in like about 5 months
 alright text continue on
 text you a person in the renowned order of life may try to even try to avoid even a dress to cover himself going to naked review that and I didn't do that if you where is anything at all it should be only a loincloth
 and when there is no necessity as soon as he should not even accepted under my walking stick as soon as you should avoid carrying anything but a dunda and they come and do a Halo that's one of those funky hourglass hourglass-shaped water pot
so you got in one hand you may have a walking stick or done do which kind of is like a
 symbol of your renunciation and another hand you have like a little pot you know like with a handle this means when it says you should avoid carrying anything else you don't have bags with all of your if you're not walking around with a done. Coming down naked with a backpack with a big REI massive back now you got a little water thing that goes in your mouth a rubber hose that is a animal back in there we have nothing okay I'm going to I'm going to fly down to Florida what are you got I got nothing and you still got a backpack there was a bunch of junk even in your nothingness right but did you see that I sent you a Google then I send you some photos
 of a barkskin outfit that was very cool
bark and a line of bark clothing so now I remember when we read these texts to send that they wear bark what it is is like take picture of big wide coconut tree
 and then like within it there's like layers of kind of like peel the outer skin off of that coconut tree
 and you get like this big
 like mash fluffy mesh what I'm trying to think of the word but like a peel like apply you know of this coconut skin and then it's dried and then it's like wearable you know any kind of got this brown looks like leather or something like that kind of coconut leather
 So anyway so here's here's how you drive everywhere here in the regulations not right yeah okay so why don't we do this then that's the question that's the elephant in the room why are its any offseason the hairy coo
walking around this outfit will he use the term prescribed duties right and he prescribed this is one prescription for one kind of person with one kind of mindset Prophet said in this day and age he he's he encouraged the wandering and the traveling but the point is to not to isolate yourself
 but to he said that the the the renunciation of the senior see as his father is what you renounce everything to spread the message of bhakti and so that's what they do young fly on airplanes and traveling around and staying up late and speaking of people you know it's really interesting when your when your Consciousness it isn't absorbed in so many extra things like we create extra things you go to my closet how many t-shirts I have up there
 I can't even count them all you have some when I got some ridiculous t-shirts up there how easy is
when you have two sets of clothes what do you wearing today same thing I wore yesterday but the other the other the other one I have the other pair and that's it that's what you imagine how much time out of your mind how much time you have left by you open up so much time where you where you don't have to concentrate on that anymore now you can concentrate on other things okay how about what are you going to eat and then you can and then you have that very simplified then you have things like what are you going to do tonight you've already got that figured out how many hours I wish we could collect all the hours we've spent wandering around Blockbuster video trying to figure out what movie I want that time back around look if you can't get it back scrolling on Netflix you know like
Netflix try to figure out what to watch and then I got too many choices simplify boiler down
 you're not making a set we're not when you and I grew up there is five channels really
 yeah we were there any major ones into local ones and then and then ipv I'm a cut off at a certain time
 but where are we now there's like literally hundreds of channels nobody's any happier not one drop happier
 so any case we're here in the regulations not right in the first verse we read about how you're supposed to only spend one night in each Village then you gotta move on right that you should I kind of disregard the needs of the body and travel constantly then this first text to it was saying about how you're meant to dress more regulations right you're supposed to be naked or if you're not naked he's just got like a little loincloth
which may be like opens which is basically like a g-string or her or at most just like a little wrap around you know your your loins and you're not allowed to carry any bags with any stuff in him you want him and you got like a little part where you can collect some water or people might put some bombs that they give you and maybe you have a stick in your other hand that's it you can't carry any bags okay you give me a lot of strict regulations here what else you got not now it's now right off the bat and art is going to get into the realization the mentality what how you're supposed to think in what realization you're meant to call to be text 3
 listen to Ozzy completely satisfied in the self should live on alms more regulation beds from door to door so your back or now yeah which is not like a witch of the position that makes you feel a little
 desperate
a little it's it it's humiliating
 not being dependent on any person or any place should always be friendly well-wisher to all living beings and be peaceful unalloyed devotee of Narayan in this way they should move from one place to another so we were hearing now that you're okay or beggar you're constantly moving but now we're also going into the internal right the external is something that in one sense even though maybe hard or painful anyone can do like for instance like if someone came up to your rug not to put a gun to your head and said wander and don't stop or I'm going to shoot you for the next month you're going to beg for your food otherwise I'm going to put a bullet in your head okay I can do that but you can't put a gun to head to someone's head and say
the friendly well-wisher of every living being internally you know like that's something that you have to call the vet you know or what else you say to be peaceful it'll be an unalloyed votive on right those are those are things that the external regulations even if they're tough it's a matter of choice where the internal realization is something that has to be cultivated and ultimately granted by the part of ABBA you know that understanding that debt and we're hearing about what it means like we're we're all this regulations meant to lead how you're supposed to transform first it says that you're meant to be satisfied in the self
 Atma Rama I'm not look at you you need to come to stage where you don't need externals to be satisfied you know you you pictures naked or barely dress so do you know their skin is like a rock
because they've had such you know they're the real lean because their meals are your regular and so you know and and kind of like paltry a lot of the time you know they're they're tolerating a lot you know the tolerating whether they're tolerating travel to telling all the stuff but inside there's like this glow of like I'm satisfied I'm happy you know you're the one that's full of anxiety I don't have anxiety cuz I've let go of everything so they got there this there I'm around and then this is so important to text one sarva bhuteshu Sue freet
 you have to become the well-wisher of all living beings that's that this all leading their you know the tall order tell her I looked at that's where we started to write with like someone got shot this weekend someone shot that person this weekend so you hate the shooter or like you did what I wanted to do
we put her clothes yeah we we put ourselves in the position where we hate culture and media has turned us into haters yeah it is it can you be a well-wisher every living being that's a very tall order in a world of friends and enemies you know I looked up the word super it because you're different words for friend what's the difference between suuret I looked up three words for friend that, use bun to bundu by Neil Sedaka don't be a sucker sucker sucker so so what I picked up and I know again no Sam's card expert but I believe that what I'm saying would be accurate and I wish we had us a regular Sanskrit consultant on the show bundu seems to imply an intimate I think probably the word bond comes from their right and like
 so so
an intimate friend a very dear or even a relative okay when I get money out for a second this is a true squirrel but it's interesting it's one of those facts
 that the British observed Indians throwing butter at the deities to get blessings to get blessings and that's where they got the phrase to butter him up what do you think about that
 how do you know that's true I don't know it's true but no okay okay so seems to indicate an intimate friendship so intimate that it's even like a like a member of the family it can also do you know a friend of the fall soccer seems to me it seems to be implied companionship like yo soccer
 can let that one go back
does suck haha seems to imply like maybe not the intimacy of the bundle but like a companion like a regular friend you know someone that's like there's a certain closeness with super it seems to open it wider and improper uses the term well-wisher a lot it means good-hearted kind-hearted well-disposed to everyone a well-wisher so when you're asked to become sarva bhuteshu super it it doesn't mean that everyone is your intimate friend but it means that you're wishing everyone what your heart has nothing but good feeling for you know one thing good for others that's that's that's what is calling us to become more like so we need to become Admiral, the singer Ozzy's meant to call to me through these austerities called vincon operon self-satisfied nothing external needed sarva bhuteshu submit a well-wisher of all living beings Shanta peaceful and finally
 norina piranha
Narayan a Iana become just a means the prime it said you're not dependent on anyone but you just in Tire depended on God did the tile depending on Lourdes Regional depending on the rain I I take shelter in you I don't seek shelter elsewhere your eye in a piranha
 Mara wants to clarify something I just wanted to confirm that according to Sri Google to you that is actually accurate but the phrase buttering up dolls come from the ancient Hindu tradition really balls of Kiev statues in order to ask for blessings but well done for my to question the fact check rocket off the fact check accuracy particularly when it comes to linguistics
 turn you up
 all right
listen yeah she should always try to see the Supreme the Supreme pervading everything and see everything including this universe resting on the Supreme okay see this has been providing everything see everything including these Universe resting in the Supreme we discussed that a bit earlier right about
 it does one real practical way to think of that
 which is that you know Christmas and in the spiritual realm enjoying his Lila's his loving Adventures
 but some of us choose that we don't want to play our natural rolling that we kind of want to try to imitate that
 then that's really not exactly possible it's kind of like a leaf wanting to be the root of the tree there's only one route but
 if you want to try then we can create the illusion
around and then that's where Krishna he's not going to leave his Lila to Common take care of that dirty work
 so he just expands himself in the form of three it's almost like telescopic right like all right three different vishnu's the first Vishnu all the universes are coming in and out of his body so in one sense all those universes are in him that they accept his body on his exhale there with drawn on his in hell
 but then he enters into each one of those universes and then he enters Into the Heart of every living being in those universes and even within the atom every atom within that universe so he's within every atom in the universe
 and every atom is within him
 forever universes within it so it has it's saying here keeps he's providing everything
 and everything is also within him
that's now you're just wandering senior see you living incredibly simply
 you've let go of all your animosity every living being you only wish well for everyone you become peaceful
 and you're the friend of everyone and now you're beginning to see that now that you freed up if you would like you're saying earlier run on now that you kind of freed up all that space in your mind
 you're beginning to perceive things that you might have heard before but you're really understanding how how God is in everything how everything is with in God and you're feeling it you know you give your developing these realizations in far greater depth than you had before that's that's the spiritual practice that's the path we're walking hear it
 you don't I think we're kind of at a time for today I think is a good place to pick up tomorrow Mera by the way we have a shared a little sandwich
assure it is one who by very nature desires another person's benefit benefactor a well-wisher
 transcendental vibration of the bag of agita is the Breath of God
 yeah
 where drop of water rolling down a little sleeve don't let politics normalize hatred or Harden our hearts and here we go
 the magic happens in our desks destitution ho ho ho it's magic you know
it's not when you reply back to you get lessons
 you too
 accept whatever Krishna provides a simple way to live or accept it even if you're not living a simple life whatever comes into your life you except you know I saw some that we got to check it out what I saw some talk that was a spiritual scientist and the title of it was something like how to know when to change the externals and how to know when to just accept them
 I would like to I would like that.
 Become the well-wisher of every living being self-satisfied and entirely dependent on God Narayan a piranha
 be like the coconut embodied but detached from the body
 alignment nectar for the coconut
you like what kind of coconut in it and I was very surprised that you didn't go to like a advertisement jingle like the man has got you just you know how you don't even have to go to try this practice because it's taking up space in your mind good memories you see this is where it becomes like a child marinade just couldn't find it no matter what no matter how ridiculous argument that you win everybody thank you for being with us this morning I just have a little morning with you guys taking in
