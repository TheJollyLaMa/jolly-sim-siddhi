 and pick the brain for 5 or 10 minutes then get him out of there and then we could go out with our show before we go on a walk on Wednesday guest good morning cuz how are you Google
good for you I got an announcement I'm going to be on a podcast today live 325 hardcore podcast for hardcore people to TruStone show on podcast is the 300th episode they asked me to talk it's from 3 to 5 if you can tolerate 2 hours of me will probably want to talk about my book and 325 I need to find it it's a streaming video Live on YouTube
 Warren Facebook the New York hardcore Chronicles maybe search for that see you there might be a little messages on little live feed if you going to go check that out if you care about that at all
 yeah cuz to buy everything up with you I'm interest
 how everyday is so wonderful here I'm sad today was a good day on the book and I I am in a bit of a breakthrough I'm hoping it'll it'll play
well you know the idea was that artistic creation they say is you just going to show up every day sometimes it's dry it's flat it's like a desert and then and then went when you least expect it you get the script downloads you start to rain upon you but he's going to show up at the regular time every day I was at a place where rum
 it seem like I hit a roadblock
 and at a certain point I got the faith that this is good because want to come out of this roadblock I'm going to be somewhere with that and never even thought I would be before so this roadblock and it played out like that I think it's going to play out while running what it was but what's the story of Yas addictive and how he after riding all the vehicle literature including the Mahabharata with the bug of agita he still feeling too despondent
 and then he goes to Narda
 and already
instructions
 and then he goes back in
 he kind of revises the srimad bhagwat time
 and then the Box time opens up with its invocation and then it's got its first second and third versus and then it's got the first Chap and I was trying to figure out how to do certain Concepts within that story that you don't understand unless you explain the more sure and I was trying to do I get the concepts in before the story the story after the right right right and then I'm going to leave the stories throughout the chapters you going to keep coming back to it you know until that's something maybe this is just what it's meant to be and so I'm hoping that that will work out well but he'll good
 come out that engine I got a clear picture of what I'm trying to do I think with writing I'm convinced with writing with our with music with lyrics
it's a zipper channeling it's now it's not like you're writing it something's writing it through you yeah it was felt like that I was I was in front of the DD's last night and
 and just got it depending on your Consciousness you'll get the complete download well my point is I was just there like I'm here I want to do this I love that would like to serve you this way if you would like me to but without without you deciding to use me this way I can't do anything and you really know when you're trying to write you know you really know it's like I can be your instrument if you want I would love to play that role but if you don't use me that way whatever I write is going to be entirely useless you know I'd be on
 I'd be forever grateful even if it's just used in a small way you know it over the wonderful thing to do to bring your conscious
to do you know anyone I tell you something wrong with you you were mentioning journaling before that I think the you know like say let's say writing 250 words a day where you just take your thoughts about your own spiritual practice or what you're studying or what you're learning and you write 250 words or so
 what are you do you do that you got a book at the end of the year you know but even believe that you got really clear thoughts would ya and clarify your thoughts on bhakti and clarify your thoughts on Krishna it's such a purifying thing to the mind you know I recommended 200 words a day 250 words that sound like that that's not that much so that much but it does make you sit down and think
 alright we're all excited we're here to support it and don't worry you can support me cuz I'm going to give a big push for my book when it's getting
come out what is a great time to go to MyLink on my bio on my Instagram page and pre-order my book that would be great preciate that Miss Mara and announcements please give back to Recovery Group meetings at 1 and 9:30 eastern time today is that like a new sweatshirt today things before Christmas gift early want to Hanukkah Kwanzaa something like that
 I sort of an early gift early gift for me it was
 so you haven't worn it many times that she has warned many times how early is Christmas give her all right going on spring on g b g herbo good morning
see how are you from tbg foxy Recovery Group Haribo how are you I'm well thank you thank you for asking me to come today so I don't think it's a good good I'm okay I'm actually okay but you know I'm walking around singing is the most wonderful time of the year and I know that this time of year is not necessarily the Most Wonderful Time of the Year and songs like that can exacerbate people's exacerbate people's suffering because one there's loneliness sometimes this time of year there is a depression there is a family family issues and dysfunction there is many many opportunities to treasure, then you could do is get together with your family other people may have other different opinions of that what's the best way to deal if you have if you're suffering some from family trauma family paying family heartbreak
loneliness and it makes you want to instead of being joyful and go out and sing carols and makes you want to cry what's the best way to deal with that using you know healthy alternative
 what's a many-faceted question and a good question so thank you and I can I can speak slowly from my experience, strength and hope coming from a 12-step anybody lines
 and through those lines as I'm through my experience
 there are many ways you know people people who have a community whether it's this with some of the sages Community was about to Recovery Group of community or nay a community yoga Community whatever Community these are resources always not to feel alone I know that holiday seasons have been specially I would say why can't I
because I've traveled I've been in so many Circles of 12 steps and then bit into it like a a n n a and a C A and C and all of those other programs in Kota I think everyone has their challenges when it comes to you know their specific Karma and their specific Dharma and their specific an artisan everything that we have to deal with so you know mine are addictions and Associated behaviors for me it was very very clear that I had to set some healthy boundaries and some years you know each year was different so you know I first got into recovery I was sort of In A Daze so I just did the Christmas thing and you know very in a very uptight tents or I will had the Good Fortune of being six thousand miles away from my family when I got clean so I spend it with other people's dysfunctional families which were which was which was
to watch because I wasn't exactly into it but it was very
 it's very it's using powerful tools if you're a 12-step program please go to as many meetings as possible pick up the phone call somebody else even if you're in a horrible position I found for myself reaching out to somebody else who I know isn't let's say a more miserable position than I am and also reaching out reaching out not like I need help reaching out to help others yes that's helped me that has helped me you know a spiritual
 program and having a deep understanding not that I have that I'm just saying that these are the things that come with practicing either 12-step program way of life or you know about the way of life understanding the true
the true benefits in the win-win of being a servant of a servant it's it's it's really beautiful and but there are some times when you know where where I need help where I desperately needed help and I'm and you know I always say this I can't save my face in my ass at the same time and I need to know that and I don't have not in that few know position where I can choose the color of my life boat and I save my face received my ass basically meaning like sometimes you got to be a little bit vulnerable sometimes it's got to be able to it's gets a little ugly and this is the beautiful thing about a spiritual
 I'm Pursuit is there's this reality a real reality and not just a front to what we what we're going through and everything's fine and glossy and
free are you doing anything special for about the recovery over the holidays is their special extra programs on the community has gotten together this year for that it's good that you're you're opting I mean is here that your prompting that so perhaps somebody the back to recovery Community would like to volunteer I know that they were having just a regular meetings on that Monday and or something I myself am available and tan German time if anyone needs to reach out maybe in the show notes you can I don't know if you guys have show notes for this just reach out to Mariah and Myra will give you my number
 and I'm sure that maybe anyone else who's available in the body Recovery Group who's willing to do that would let me know and I'll just let Mara now and give her a bunch of numbers so I know that
actually connecting that with what you are good at all so I could do is said about going through these processes you know we have to always know that everything this too shall pass yeah everything all the good all the bad the ugly this too shall pass sometimes we're just a prisoner of her own feelings or Vernon artez and when we let those things run our lives
 the outcomes not so great and as Castillo said before if I'm not willing to ask Krishna for help
 and honestly asking Krishna to use me as a tool through these times are these tribulations then the result is not going to be the greatest and this is a matter of practice it's it's not something that I just like hey I'm just going to snap my you know I usually have to be beaten into that position but you know cuz it doesn't because cuz he was just like that I am the one who needs the two-by-four and what did you say
you know like a wild Oconomowoc you know we'll let that grind bring a higher let it get we're going to get Granite we might just get ground ground up over the holidays and let that grind live bring your hands in the air and entry and Trust Krishna has made you that is is
 I'm supposed to live up to some almost an unreal expectations of what holiday is supposed to be and it and I use that as like a mirror in a measuring stick of like how I should be and how it should look and it's again it should be one of these like Charming 19552 television show of a holiday and Perry Como special, special on Father Knows Best special whatever be whatever it be there's no I'm done
 I think that's like that was
anything about the expectations of ourselves and where we should be I think it's the whole thing is why we're here but practicing body right to say that you know
 actually just to say that we have this High bar we move towards this High bar
 but we do have all of these in our chosen all these things and all these realities they get in the way
 I think for me myself I can't say that I think it's really important for me to know that the measuring stick that I have is my personal measuring stick every single person has their own measuring stick no way we can either use that measuring stick as a magic wand or we can use it to beat ourselves over the head and yeah and I think I think it's really important to know every single one of us that every single one of our we're all in a
our unique position of our
 of our rebirth every single one of them and for me to compare myself to you I go or myself to you cuz do it which I do constantly because we do want to get to a higher state you know but we do want to get to the higher state that's available to us in our own personal Journey Through the guidance of bhakti have a pod and for me the 12 Steps so this is something where I find and what I found in the last year's and this helps me also through hard times to say sometimes I think like what about Christie what you know he's just so perfect and he has to do this and sometimes I get a little bit like how can I talk to Castillo but he's just you know like you sometimes things but it's it's usually around Christmas time once I get around that eggnog forget about it
I don't want to I don't want to compare myself to kiss to her because Christina is beautiful and unique in his own way he was born into this body for the reasons that he needs to be born in this body you are born into this body for the reasons that you need to be born into this body and so am I and if I'm running 15 50 points and too stupid has 150 points and you have 150 points and Christina is somewhere else, somewhere else but who is run farther
 we've all run 50 points and we have to realize or least I have to realize that this is where I am and I need to accept that that's me and there's kaszuba it doesn't excuse me for doing the best I can but it does help me
 to accept the situation for exactly what it is and for me being in the exact place I need to be exactly what I need to be there and to learn exactly what I want to learn or do you need to learn to move forward love it love it so if you're lonely reach out go to a meeting
talk to somebody help somebody go do go to a homeless shelter dish out food I love that I tried to do that in Munich a bunch of years in a row but there's no there isn't really much poverty here so it's not much of a need you were like the only
 yeah so so that's what's always help me going to beating sticking close to the people who understand me sticking close to the people who are sticking with the winners who are sticking with the program who are trying to raise themselves better for somebody also to show love and to give love and reciprocal love so
 Christmas Eve what's up do we have some meetings lined up for Christmas Day and Christmas the regular meetings on Monday
so it's it's actually Christmas day it's at 1 Eastern is Christmas evening 25th evening in Europe 24th is the Sunday we have two meetings on Sundays so we're all set and what I will recommend is that you know you can just jump on Zoom no one needs to open the zoom meeting on the big baby r j so just go on Zoom right in the chat hey I want to meet with somebody and somebody out there on the chat will come and meet with you in soon for sure.

 pretty pretty much pretty much
I am getting magical disappearing
 vicious appeared and pinch-hitter K2 is just like he's gushing is offering heartfelt prayers now
 yorgos text 36
 does chitra cages speaking to Lord Vishnu you exist in the beginning middle and end of everything from the most minoot particle of the cosmic manifestation the Adam to the gigantic universe and total material energy nonetheless you are Eternal having no beginning end or middle you are perceived to exist in these three phases and us you are permanent when the cops come out application does not exist you exist as the original potency very interesting here is God appearing right before a person and the person is not asking for anything appreciate
glorified we live in a world where I say okay I want you to go to church which a person you could do in church you say a prayer or something generally please give even if it's a good thing please give me help please help me my marriage or please help me please help my kids something like that you never necessarily see that so much in the bottom to come and if you do see it it's to lead you to pure devotion and so here he is Contra to Katie's not your son help me get a son and now you he's had the sun the sun has died he's suffered intense that because it then he was given so many good instructions in that tragic tragic moment
 and he got to reflecting on this wisdom in that tragic moment is transformed them and then in NY
when he when he became detached who threw that he was given this meditation and when you performed that meditation with the Detachment right not searching for anything of this world through it but you just kind of feel like almost like you're gone through the wringer and all of like the desire in you to try to enjoy this world has just been wrung out of you by the
 by this you know by Manchester sufferings that you go through right so then then you're like a sponge let you know if you take a sponge and it's full of water you can pour water over it and it's just like running off the edges saturated but if you squeeze that spawned you get all the other water out then you absorb whatever is poured into it and so he had all of that on the enjoy with the material world Spirit just squeezed out of them by the tragedy and then that was filled up with the wisdom of the sages you know what do what Naruto and I'm gear told him in and what his own son told him when he came back was really made
you know right to hear and answer then they already gave him here meditate on this meditate on these versus a meditate on now Vision was in front of them does not none of that is left in anymore is all been squeezed out and everything is coming from him now it's not the it's not the the workings of the of a confused program to mind it's coming from within is coming from the soul and it's all truth it's all reality and any Xanax to see feeling it in and sharing these these thoughts and prayers
 you ever wonder did you ever Pray For Stuff
 do stuff or whatever what do you private
 you know I don't exactly pray for the health but I pray for God to enter their life alone at Circle
that's right I like that yeah whatever way God wants to almost like I try to feel like I'm playing God if I'm praying for their help maybe God wants to take this person and I'm trying to keep them alive I want to take him maybe this person's time to go that's how I've been praying lately it's like I'm sort of like God you know what I want you know what to do. You got you got a better idea than a better plan than me I'm not even good at my own simple Family Planning but you know what to do please I pray for this person's connection you know
 you know you know Louie Louie's in a coma we do you know Olivia Louise one of the original guys on the podcast and it's like I've been trying to figure out how to pray for this guy and I pray that Krishna entered his mind wherever his mind is whatever is hard as that Christian is with him I don't know if Chris wants to take me out of this cold I want I love to learn to live so I can
with them and spend time with him and appreciate him but maybe Christmas got some other plan that that he has to stay and just maybe Christmas quiet quiet quiet in his mind so we can have this beautiful vision and then releasing him up some plan please give this person connection wherever they go
 I've also been praying for Louie front of the Wagon train today
 a real a real Burrell
 yes
 connection a connection and all the people that love them connection as well
 all right every universe is covered by 7 Layers earth water fire air Sky the total energy and false ego each 10 times greater than the previous Gobstopper so it's 10 times greater
interesting huh so their universe is covered by in the same way our bodies made up these elements the universe is made of these is that crazy will you know I'm greater and what's the last one what's the last layer of Vegeta has to climb out of is that crazy and is 10 times greater and end it is compound interest so to speak of the layers and times go to that 10 times greater than that so 70 770 elements so and then 10 times on each one so it's 7 + 70 + 700
 he was an avid whatever if it's if it's whatever though if it's let's say we're 1-mile fix the first one that would be 7 miles 676-706-7070 Thousand Miles thick doing trigonometry but you know I read something once recognized because when we hear some of this we talkin about
the universities has like a ton of Earth around and then a ton of fire around and then we are running I don't even know how I just accepted like I can understand this and I could get it a little bit but that's what all has to leave this shell there's a shell and then the growth of the fire ants in the saddle shells that mind shell the mind of the universe perhaps that's why I read I read something and I actually believed it was a bug of agita commentary by Shawn Kerr Charlie of all people of all ages and in the point that he made not the did nothing to help me all that much but I did give me a clue and I think this is important
 when we study things like this how to add understand someone literally said he said like he said like if you have like a plate of food unless they have a bowl of soup right and someone comes in and jump or some poison in the soup right now we call the whole bowl of soup poison
oh that's poison sure it's not like it's a bowl of poison is a bowl of soup with some poison in it but we call it now that the poison is in there the whole thing isn't senses as good as poison
 and so these layers around the universe shrink or charge of saying it's like that like one we call Earth because there's an earthy element within it write the next week old water cuz there's a water heater element within it doesn't mean like if necessary like just a hundred percent or at than a hundred percent water but it was like that that's example he use yeah but we can get it is very interesting how do you get out of it and he can add a I guess yeah yeah we tend to think we can think or figure it out you can't figure it even if you can't even figure it out we don't even know the old and it's like being at the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the Grand Canyon so we can have this analogy together but if you're at the bottom of drink do you were to look
it seems like you're at the top are you can seems like you can see the top but if you were to go to that top you can and goes out and up again and it's a psycho that must be the top and then it goes and if you get to that point because out an upper get you can't even really the top down on the Snake River Canyon that's not the Snake River Canyon is another place for Boo at your national parks down was jumping over the Snake River Canyon and it wasn't there a different I guess it's a different kind are they related to each other I brought climb the Snake River Canyon my point is we are so at the bottom and our senses are so limited that we can't even figure out the map you act so if we're trying to figure out how to get out of our own way good luck we can't you could get them little inside some little some little boy
about Instagram self-help Guide to Life coach good luck but Krishna can actually hold you by the hand and walk you out God can hold you by the hand and assist you to let go of these things you're attached to and give you causeless knowledge name the nurse name the verse
 God can take you by the hand and give you cause this not a hammock all this knowledge and
 reform attachments
 what
 channel yeah Survivor again again I tell you I don't like to come to yoga.
 Continuing on
 how did you finish that one though this is incredible very inspiring just stop talking I guess
there are innumerable eating a numerable universe's besides this one is interesting that we just think we're trying to figure out this universe there is in no more trouble once and although they are unlimitedly large they move about like atoms in you write our whole bodies on Universe Gem boy in my body germ boy trying to figure out my body he has no idea is a whole nother body right here by bacteria is living in my body he has no clue about Mary's body
 the words your mother universe
 it's a whole nother Universe there for you were called unlimited another Lord Supreme
 an intelligent persons who thirst for sense enjoyment and worship various demigods are no
better than animals in the human form of life
 because of their animalistic propensities if failed to worship your lordship and instead they worship the insignificant demigods but
 who are Albany to Sparks of your glory and it with the destruction of the entire universe including the demigods the benedictions received from the demigods also banished just like the nobility when a king is no longer in power or praying to God for Stuff
 it's almost like being in a prison cell and you can say you can get whatever you want anything whenever I want a bar soap bar soap I don't know what to do prison clothes I want some I want to another chair in my prison this is what's going on in material world instead of like trying to get out of birth and death we're just praying for more stuff within the prison cell and then
go to prison even with Good Karma we want Good Karma I get my astrological chart and I got bad karma that's a problem I got a cataract that planet that's a malefic planet I got to wear this Jam that's what I got to do what I got to do some months right to a demigod know
 thank you just going to stop there
 oh Supreme Lord if persons obsessed with material desires for sense credit vacation through material opulence worship you
 where the source of all knowledge and a transcendental to the material qualities they are not subject to material rebirth just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants that again if person is obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material opulence worship you were the source of knowledge
Treasures of the material qualities they are at subject material rebirth
 just that sterilize fried seeds do not produce plants so you know if you are materialistic but you end up worshipping Lord Vishnu
 he will fly up your desires he was saying that they're people that worship the demigods it and you know I know two people that are new to this is just all sounds weird but the ideas try to think of it like this that this was a sophisticated
 Universal worldview you know kind of a guidebook to that saying that behind the sun there's a person on the moon there's a person on the river in the mountainous people and in the end we can call them demigod C9 powered beings and that because they provide for us because he's these beings are invested with much greater intelligence much greater Billy much greater opulence that you can you can focus on them
meditate on them you can ask them you know for the things of this world and in the previous four suits in the people that do that in one sense or no better than animals cuz they're just searching for the same thing written animal is searching for food is searching for sex at searching for shelter and more like you're searching for those same things in a sophisticated way I want wealth in this world I want to see what's in this world I want power I want sex or I want them in the higher planets you're asking for the same thing that animals asked for and he saying now if that's where you're at but instead of going to the demigods go to the all purifying root of all existence you Worship Christian for those same things
 then even though you're asking for the wrong thing because you've come in contact with that all pure find source what is it all off of it thrill of it drove out you know it's like when you just think of krishna's purify then they threw that those desires
have it's just like if you take a seat in your fried in a frying pan you can plant in the ground nothing's going to grow from it and severally went all of the desires in our heart contact Krishna through a meditation on him it just rising and so did you become free of all those desires of the fried my desires right out
 that's interesting Christmas brighter desires
 I still have some I've got some I've got some desires although all you got to do is think it through right think those desires to have with you that especially when you get a little older you think it through when I was younger and I had a desire be like well maybe I could just manipulate this and go that way and I'll try this out and you know no one's going to have to understand anything about this but as I get older you get the desire and the you like you know I mean it's just a little you've been through that before you've been there done that
and it's not as it's not as shiny as it actually appears that it appears like a diamond but it's a piece of jagged broken glass while you're thinking like Kylie Brown over here on the chat poor cuz she brought us example of proving my shoes exactly went through that
 right where we at text 30 x 40 x 40 39 okay again living entities these are subjected to the repetition of birth and death would change everything living entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature but since you are trans a dental one who is inclined to associate with you and Transcendence escapes the conditions
material nature
 I mean you don't believe in birth and death just you don't believe in like the cycles of life we're we're making the same stupid mistakes in this life we're going around in circles right leave and say that we circles I'm doing the same stupid thing I did last year we're going in patterns and we're almost like a helpless with in this life
 so we're just taking this up a notch and seeing a bigger circles 4040 you sit so still when you listen to me you really focused I'm taking it in I know I know I always like to see Frozen should I keep speaking is anybody hear me is
 oh conquerable one when you speak of scratching my pic in my ears always stretching and when you spoke about
conquerable one
 when you spoke about bug about Dharma which is uncontaminated religious system for achieving the shelter of your Lotus feet that was your Victory persons who have no material desires like the Kamara who are self-satisfied sages worship you to be liberated from Material contamination in other words they accept the process of Bhagavad Dharma to achieve shelter at your Lotus feet OK Google, and if there's so many different types of Dharma what can again you know won't compete dharmik to get the things of this world I mean I'm I'm connecting with with love to Bhagavad right to the source of all existence that spoke about.
 Pink for contradictions all forms of religion but bhagavat Dharma work under the conceptions of fruit of results and distinctions of you and I and yours and mine
the followers of Shema by which time had no such Consciousness they are all Krishna conscious thinking that they are krishna's and Krishna is theirs they are up there other low-class religious systems there are other low-class religious systems which are which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the game of Mystic power but such religious systems full of passion and Andy are in pure and temporary
 will you back because they are full of Envy they are full of adharma or a religion
 big mystery people having trouble people have trouble you know oh my God this sounds like Terry you know it's judgmental oh it's you know things are different it's in what whatever tradition you come from within that you're going to find some people
approaching it for the wrong reasons or for Less
 your reasons and an end in the same tradition you're going to find other people that are approaching entirely purely only wanting love placing love is the highest principle so that's not Saturn that's all the different groups all the different Traditions have both low and high thinkers and so let's recognize that and let's begin to orient whatever tradition were in let's begin to Orion our minds to the higher thinking
 we three kings of Orient Are
 I used to think it was We Three Kings of Orient Are house like where's our Orion r
 I don't even know what your tongue says that the road
three of them
 three wise men in the Bible that mentions a wise man, but maybe everyone thinks it's three because they mention gold frankincense and myrrh oh maybe maybe I don't know that's what they were not from Orion are they were from the Orient
 then I start thinking maybe they're from India
 a lot of people think that you know what I mean maybe the Indian sages showed up Darren gifs to this Prophet child
 how can religious systems that produce Envy of oneself and others be beneficial for oneself and for them what is auspicious about following such a system what is actually to be games by causing pain to one's own self due to due to self envy and by causing pain to others what arouses your anger and practices a religion
laying it out here
 why because there's no mystical metaphysical scriptures books teachings that don't necessarily hold hands so much with bhagavat Dharma candy riddles are a lot of other ideas ideas desires passion to touch her
 my dear Lord once occupational duty is instructed in the srimad bhagavat Tom and the bug of agita according to your point of view which never deviates from the highest goal of Life those to Father occupational duties under your supervision being equal to all living entities moving and non-moving and not considering high and low are called areas such as aliens are aliens are aliens worship such Ariens worship you the Supreme personality. Head is another word stolen by Nazis are Ian's it means like the Civilized civilized people
refined refined means every bind person right yeah you know it's interesting if you were to read this verse it's like
 I love how this book points to look people there's a system here there's things to do this thing's what's that there's a cosmic order in order your point of view which never deviates from the high school there is a goal of Life most people don't don't don't wake up in the morning thing I got a cheap mic the people just live they don't think like there is a reason why there's a reason behind what we're doing there is a goal to this existence and I think without that life can be some sort of like whatever like what am I doing slugging it out in this world we have to understand there's a highest goal then there's then there's other goals that we fit within our other goes to fit within that highest goal
 we live in a goalless culture people become sad because of it or we choose skulls that
then I still got evil yeah or refining time they're not so balabal
 thank you my dear Lord it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing you
 it is not my Lord it is not unusual it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing you and maybe it's a favor it would be easier to read if it said it is possible for what is a double it's a double negative yes that's what you do well not to speak of seeing you personally merely by hearing the Holy Name Of Your Love
only once even chundo has that's like a low-class dog eater
 men of the lowest class are free from all material contamination it's hard to believe this to be under the under the circumstance will not be free from contamination Silly by seeing you are they saying cuz tuba that you can perform tons of simple activity and then you chant the Holy Name once and you're free from all that all that bad karma tax really potentially right
 therefore my dear Lord simply by seeing you as now wiped away all the contamination so he's putting himself in that position right look at me I'm a lowlife he's a right he's not but he's saying that he's seen himself as Tiny cuz he's seeing his previous attachment to having the Sun and that be the most important thing he's seen you know
when you love someone
 dearly
 and you've been focused on something that you know it it's almost like he's seeing his I was trying to to live and find love separately from you God
 and now I'm seeing that as being like Unfaithful you know like like you you've been here all along with nothing but love for me nothing but care for me nothing but support for me and I was ignoring it trying to find happiness somewhere else so he's feeling a sense of deep regret from that and you saying like I'm the chondola right I'm the low-class person or by bringing my mind to you it's burned all of that away you know and now I'm feeling this ecstasy
 you like it
 took this Oasis is there for my dear Lord simply seeing you has not wiped away all the contamination my bad
