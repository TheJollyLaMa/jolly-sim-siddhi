 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from brindavanam this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your hoe stroganoff in Cohoes and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York stupid Oscars live in my poor welcome to the show Welcome to episode number
 60 to 1262 daily study the Tremont baton and I want to tell you kaszuba me and Mary I probably have the best day so far our whole trip we can talk about that we're going to talk all about it give me a play-by-play and you're going to love it
just playing with you I want to hear about your damn want to hear the whole thing in detail to tell you in detail cuz the details the Beauties and the details and today we were like you know what the devil's in the details not do anything but the classic things we're going to hear and we're going to chant and we're going to walk to holy places and there's no rush there's nowhere to go
 but we had to be somewhere by 11 but even that when you hear that story it's so we just start off walking out the back gate at walking through the ghost shower to keep the cows we lost a camera by the way bro keep talking and and we just said you know what let's stop in the go show where they go showers where they keep the cows and let's just read about the Bison up a charger so I had sought you I just booked a life of the Bison of Saint we started reading about shrinivas acharya you know there's something very
fortunes about our transformation by hearing the lives about Saints hearing how they lived hearing who their Associates were who their gurus were what inspired them on their spiritual path and this is my relation to that of course is the appear at the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the appearance of shuri the buckets around the Stars hockey talk and I was listening to Wonderful class by Sita Devi she said she's she's another she listens all the time she was surprised to hear this was a great class and one of the point she made was that when he was young just a boy
 she'll about to sit down to his very attached to hearing about the lives of the great Saints
 and you can see how it just led to him taking that life itself I think when people lie when you know when you have young kids if
find an attachment hearing about those people it could really
 Health director entire life so I was just going to say also on a related note since we talked about the details as we go on to those some oddie's suppose you know there's the devotees to Maricela David samadi and Portage goswami somebody all these people that were in our life actively in our life and just to say a prayer each one is that we're kadamba kanana Swami so don't become Ramada is there to do special but yeah you know why because you know people not just children but adults to we want Heroes you want people to like a dropped pin so to speak of what direction we should we should move in our life archetypes of saintly Behavior to have that in our Consciousness like oh this is
we should behave this is right this is Noble this is what successes that changes our trajectory and so by reading this I realize you know what I'm going to really die than to live to the great Saints and I don't want to know all about the end there in the in their in their lives are like white mistreated by such Aria he was he was like
 heat worksheet Tanya told his parents about your going to have a son and your son is going to do my work for me it's amazing
 so anyway and they couldn't have children and they said you will you will have a son even though it was late in their life and they couldn't have tried to have children they couldn't then he was born when Laura Cunningham it was a Christian Miracle of birth baby Krishna Miracle but anyway that was something we continue the old trail we decided to sit at the
you know we did we went to mod on Mohan and because you do Maraschino practically speaking built
 by the goats climbing this was tonight and go Swami's Temple and protected monument and not only that I said Marriott you know what this place is crazy I took Mara to the grunt has somebody now the group is called the Grand Tara Lodge the king of all books but it's the samadhi were the Great Saints wrote these books and they realize they got to
I want to read these books they're like now these are too much for humans to understand we have to put them in a somebody so no one can ever read them like a well-known will ever read them so I held on to that somebody and I said please give me a download the world's ready let me be your mouthpiece
 and and you're going to let it all out today on the show are you ready
 he said some prayers at the grunt to somebody
 an odd word on the trail we stopped at the yamuna and we chance of the you want to ask them I tell you things were going and credible then we kept and where we go from there
 you know there's this Ancient kalea Temple by Guru used to take me to that no one knew about but since then it's been sort of found out
well yeah it's near there now this beautiful krishnakoli Aditi which is ancient they say Christian is great grandson. You're not carved this duty but it was lost for generations and you can just see
 did I used to manage eat my my my lamp not Atlantic City was the other place for the
 Las Vegas what's that place where the
 and the Jersey Shore where we park when was shelter play there it was a total ghetto you guys know this Jeff Eisenberg knows his total ghetto in the 90s early 90s but at one time it was a great Beach you know who is Seaside town that everyone loved but now then it was 90s it was a ghetto then I started buying unrealistic
now I'm up again so this is how the material world Works some things that ghetto and then it climb super high becomes incredible becomes polished and then it crumbles again and it has Cycles like that stupid me walked around bring Dobbin went in one sense it was like ghetto India was total ghetto was a poor country a poor Nation it was a struggle nation and now you see India sort of On The Rise they're redoing all these temples they just built around Monday or they're cleaning everything are you guys know I'm all I'm saying is in a moment things can change and an American can be the third world developing-nation crumbly nation in a moment you see it already you know the currency drops things like that happen Rome fault but I don't have to do it to Kaliyah Temple it has to do with this deity was like a majestic Diddy and then it went underground when I was young man going to this Temple it was in a box basically like a closet
and now they built a huge Temple around it and I was like man I can't believe the where where's the temp like oh my God this Temple must be the old Kalia Temple and sure enough it was almost like walking into someone's house before something like that was like walking it not even one of them or something like that now it's time for a lassie and we don't have to be so we went to get a bunch of Bihar Lassie and then on the way out because then we had to meet a friend and now this is very interesting on the way out that the Rickshaw driver just started saying all these different temples as we are passing and then he mentioned a temple that earlier the day I said I'm going to take you to a secret shaligram Temple have you ever been to the Shaolin Temple
 me the strawberry you don't shower grab chocolate are the stones from the Kentucky River in a pop and then I used to go there
secretlittle Temple giant beach ball shall G and so I can about this on the side and actually says secret shaligram Temple secrets so anyway we had this darche on in this is also in a weird smell almost like somebody's house at Buffalo a bizarre and then we went to you know Monday. Who put out on us when we spoke is putting out my book and so ramdas for Monday but he's a genius and he said rocking up I want you to go to this Temple that we just purchased and they just purchased a lullaby boo Temple now wow Ababa the store when she was like who the first Bengali to have a temple there you know I've tried to go Swami's
 and so
Sportacus bhaktisiddhanta spoke of this Temple I think who am I to spoke of this Temple I'm not sure but it it's got history in the Bengali goatee ablation of tradition Delilah Baba was his wealthy wealthy business owner but because he was trained from youth
 like a violation of you got caught up on materialistic life and then one day but at least the way the person explain today it was a vision but I've heard that he was standing on the street she was getting old and someone said to him some lady was sleeping sweeping the streets and she says the Sun is setting Move Along go on your way meaning get out of my way I'm sweeping the streets but when he heard that it resonated with something in his heart something that he learned as a child as a devotee like I'm getting old the Sun is setting in my life and he got rid of his business and he moved to bring David any built this beautiful Temple and bring David and it's been under total disrepair by all his ancestors

bhakti student a celebration of his 150th birthday feast and a traditional Temple so the boys don't sit with the girls but I could see Mara and every time I brought something out I'm waving back can they say they cannot eat a feast unless it has the egg plant Friday three different types of course I thought I was going to lose my mind and I was waving Tamara and then sweet rice and his glove gems that exploded with glob German syrup like Mike a saffron syrup in the center of it it was the most it wasn't an addict we were just like today is getting better and better

at least I tell you there's always a new cool place to discovering pradhaman you discover that the donations Temple there is a temple that it was built on the spot it's in the round last time use the journey home
 what is this one great Saints and he just was living in someone's house in their closet he had his little Temple

I mean this is this was his this is where is how much of a stabilizer I heard that big t r x down the street there, and of course the end of the temple room because the yearly Festival here that builds up to Gwar purnima
 the birth of shuja Tanya's it's building up now so like
oh crap I can't believe it's like it's kind of not worth it to go to the morning program because it's just that all crowded so packed but I will make you make that excuse for you okay I could be Maya I'm just going to be a little advice but I went to the Box on class so it'll go to book on somebody's nothing so many universes a mood in the room you know it's kind of like here we are here we are a manifestation of the vision and the devotion and the saver of Shield about to sit on his arse Wichita core
 and you know it's something special about it like today was a day where they opened up the wing of the machine gave Temple and the big bull really at least they're supposed to
 can I bring a d d in there
a long time ago so you can go in and see what it what is going to be like you know
 and I you know I only have one more day here and then I leave and I it's a 3-day thing you leave tomorrow the day after tomorrow
 oh man and so after the class a kind of Flying high in remembrance of Shield about the event to start what a figure
 you know what a brilliant scholar would have completely sold out devotee Innovation Ava
 and what a Visionary and again is it a we are
 recipients of of his grace you know so many decades later
 set alarm
 I wanted to make sure that they're not announcing like when does the thing open and who can go in there and all that so I just went to the office of the tovp and I said you know and I'll can can I go in can we go
kids at some point and the Savoy just said
 so was like not part of any official tour anything but I just had free
 Roman Reigns just go all over that Temple and so you know I went into the new mystery native wing
 I'm telling you it's like this that there's a Mastery in the architectural design and everything it is breathtaking it's breathtaking when you get in there and you get in that like circular pit in the two flights up this tremendous
 riaza you know a synonym for him with a with a massive black granite sudarshan chakra in the background and then you go to two flights up and you have like all the different Davis are looking down you know there's if there's Lakshmi in in Garuda behind him and then is promote
Siobhan in in dry they're all like looking down is powerful
 and then it and then today they were doing some special lug nuts and special ritual in the center of the tovp itself at a massive thing set up and on the altars in there they had life-size replicas of the dida's that will be there over though when they do open she could really get a feel for what is going to be like wow that was fast and I mean when your on when one end of that Temple and you look down and you see what you can you be able to look for like 150 yards and see if they're in a string of Dave in his Temple it's going to be
 and then I went off road and I went up to different levels and I look down and then I went into those those big platforms up there this big dome platforms will didn't you go during the wisdom of the sages to her when we were there he's
stay right down the bottom and hardly saw anything I was able to go everywhere anywhere and everywhere I let you know I was sick that day so I didn't take the tour
 so so you know those platforms that have domes like up you know what I'm saying like there's the theaters the main Dome then there's two other there's many domes and then Izzy's many domes that are like big plop you bring two hundred people on to those platforms that I'm incredible promos your way up in the sky and the end every angle that you look at his Majestic it's so powerful I was just chatting my rounds and thinking you know I wanted to read something about can I read when we do a little about the setanta you know what it's my realization you study the lives of great the Saints and makes you aspire to be that let me read you a little something right now okay this is describing a Time
 when Sheila Bucky sit on his arse while he talked or he was born the son of the great brilliant Saint and writer and songwriter and just about to figure
should have bought even though talk or and he was incredibly that show about to sit down to his son was this incredible intellect even as a boy like he was into the bait and he wasn't it you know and he was editing book says I like a child practically and he be just like super another level personality
 and then he said I'm going to take up the mission of of sharing that the teachings in the grace of Sri chaitanya in in in in in the teachings of pure body yoga and what he did was he took a vow but before I do that I'm going to prepare myself by chanting 1 billion names of Krishna billion 1 billion 1 billion I don't know how much that if I took a million years of more less just practically chatting all day 1 billion by now you know what I mean
so when he was finally ready you know that he was thinking of taking up this mission that his father passed away and his Guru Baba ji passed away in that really sent him into some very Deep Emotions you know so I'm going to read a little something and then I want to read about this dream that he had rather I don't mean it I didn't mean any offense by that was just curious if that was a pensive mean to minimize is Channing 1 billion names I'm just wondering
 how many names are channeled that's all go ahead
 so she'll about t-72 saraswoti prabhupada was feeling very discouraged in the absence of should have like 70 talk or in Chula Gorka shortest Baba ji Maharaj
 sing the helpless condition of the spur
a section in the country and the propaganda of the sahaja is the imitators these people who took body very cheap and just kind of made a mockery of practically
 and I was just taking over you know any felt alone now you know he was thinking how will I fulfill the desire of my spiritual Masters how will I be able to teach this message if she cheats on him a hopper I do not have enough money or Manpower nor do I have any knowledge or talent that would enchant the public have no material Skiller wealth how can this grave task be performed by me I won't be able to teach this message the message of my spiritual Masters
 thinking this he displayed his pastime of gloom and depression
 then one night he saw in a Visionary trance
 that Lord chaitanya had arrived from the east side of the yoga Pete temple with his associates
 I need the sound of kirtan
he was a sending to his birth site with him were the six go Swami's
 should have Juggernaut. Babaji core and show the core to shore. Babaji they were all present in there were faults and transcendental forms they appear before him and somehow in unison
 they said the following to him already saraswoti why are you worrying
 begin the task of establishing pure bhakti
 distribute the message of Sri chaitanya universally
 expand the service to the Holy Name Abode and desire should Tanya with unbreached enthusiasm
 broadcast this message of bhakti
 innumerable people immeasurable opulence and down the scholarship awaits the blessing to serve your mission
call Will manifest one requires come forward with full strength to distribute the message of Sri chaitanya spray my Dharma throughout the globe no worthy Hendrix or Menace will be able to obstruct this undertaking of yours we are forever with you
 right and I heard that you know I heard that after I after I want it all over when up high came back down so it's so the whole massive Temple I came in and I listened to this lecture by 6:11 she read that and I say my car is also true you know it's like in the end and I'm living right in this moment of History where
 this you know Grand Temple which is kind of like the kind of the center of the Hub of the the mercy of sheets Italian or throughout the world that's been established you know he won it says innumerable people you know I mean that's
you can't even move a raccoon there's like so many thousands of people there to hear Bob with them you know innumerable people in measurable opulence found the scholarship awaits the blessing to serve your mission this this was fulfilled and it's being more and more fulfilled all the time
 I really see it now I want to read another thing to be an exciting time I was feeling just so there you know being a temple here in that class you know dealing his presents this is something that
 this is this is something for all of us but to Yogi's who do the practice of chanting the names weather in kirtan especially if you're into kirtan I think they should be mandatory for every kirtan training done write this down is mandatory
look here Nelly trainings mandatory and for everybody that picks up a a b bag and a job in Milan and chance here this this is life-changing this is this is good stuff here ready ready now he says you cannot vibrate the Holy Name simply by moving the lips and tongue
 all right in other words you're saying
 it's more than just the sound that we make with our mouths for to be Krishna for that for that sound to be no different from Krishna
 right you cannot you cannot vibrate the Holy Name simply by moving the lips and tongue
 the pure name of Krishna is not lip deep but hardening
 how much deep right that damn not lip deep heart heart heart.
 Ultimately it goes beyond the heart
and reaches the land of Krishna
 When Christmas Comes Down
 the name comes through the heart and moves the lips and tongue and that vibration is the holy name of Krishna and when Krishna in the form of sound sends from the transit Dental world into the heart
 and from the heart controlling every aspect of the nervous system comes to lips and tongue dancing that is Christmas name
 how about that right I love it I love it so it's it's the power of the parampara also it's it it's and I think a lot of people listening to this when they tried to explain bhakti to someone and it's as if they're not even talkin it's like krishna's speaking through them and sometimes people will say to me or to you
wow what a great class
 it's not like you and I were trained to be or Raiders or anyting it's that we are just like imbibing through Reading and throw hearing
 the philosophy that has been trickling down for Millennia and its Landing in the Lower East Side on our laps in New York City and they were talking and it's just coming out of your mouth that's why people of England been too bossy for a very short time they can speak with such strength and Authority cuz it does if Krishna speaking through them and it will and it has the ability to change other people it's very powerfully
 it's a it's a Transformer transforming energy going through your body that's transforming everybody that hears it
 you know who had I had that experience recently recognized
 Chattahoochee
yeah because you know she does a lot of teaching you know she's a regular Zoomer here and she she teaches you know a lot of my classes she's taken and then she kind of takes from them and organizes in her own way and then she presented to different groups like she's got something called Dharma
 Dharma shiksha Sangha
 which is just for yoga teachers
 and it's for yoga teachers to check in once a month and she shares different teachings different ideas things that'll be that they might want to teach and think and practice is that they can do themselves to help them understand it that's great and so you know she I'm trying to see if I can pull it up here but she wrote to me saying exactly what you're saying that you know how excited she was she was saying that you feel everyone the message was going through her
 out to these people and it's like I don't even know what I'm I don't even know how I'm saying the things I'm saying you know that's the power of
electric currents you know I stick a fork in the electric socket and then I text Mara and she's and then you touch her and you were all getting an electric shock so that it just happens when you connect with the Bonafide parampara it's going through you and that same way you hear people try to speak of spiritual talking
 it feels like you and I've done this week. Her people of certain people who claim to be gurus and stuff like that so we listen to them because we like to give you no be open-minded about these things and some people just like what are you saying like where is this coming from makes no sense we feel like they're disconnected from any lineage
 and sometimes you can take your notes and do your studying and do all this and nothing comes through even though you're saying the exact things that you studied and read this isn't it it's not a live
 it's not like I'm part of the way to make it move through you is your ego has to be
why you can't like okay this is my chance to step into some big sandals here and like prove to them that I am a very very wise in the yoga philosophy it's not the complete opposite yeah so little please go to rise power me to speak I don't know so much and then I'll just send your body becomes taken over to type or zest buy spirit in the same with kirtan here right like the pure name of krishna's not lift deep it's hard to do so in other words I need you know if you're sitting down there live kirtan anything okay I'm going to blow everyone away now okay I'm going to let you know right you're just you totally you're not you don't have your forehead Outlet you're not connected not plugged in
 where I saw rebates stick your fork in the electrical and keep it in their hold on the kids
tell you no one has to know what has to like
 tried you know in some way one drop if one drop can come down and enter my heart
 then that can that can rise up to my lips and come out and that one drop will be worth more than all of my power you know x billion you know
 I like that one you think I should be mandatory
 yeah I forgot the sound of this is great yeah this is a great celebration it's not just about a feast of the Beast is important but yes it's good hearing about it after I went up and I went all the way up to the top just blown away came back down
then I went out the front end and those that were here with us you know a few weeks ago when we had our pilgrimage to my poor can remember in the front there were two big statues that were hovered like how do they kind of like they're just wrapped up in big bags and what was that about that was a giant vagina you know that The Gatekeepers okay so the two there to The Gatekeepers have forms like Vishnu with four arms they were uncovered today and my God is powerful beautiful and you can stand right up to their feet
 and and then I wondered down and then you know this underneath the temple or all these offices in different rooms for different kind of get-togethers and in all of that
 and I went in there and there was a display about chill about your Sonata starts by to talk or his whole life and all kind of artifacts were kind of reproduced
different quotes and all kinds of writings and lots of photographs have been was really really well done I was really impressed you know I'm really looking for
 Ulta dumb. That's where I'm at prabhupada internet about people there he also met us there I just found out so is the man that was the spot I think the same people that did that did this display there was really done very Tastefully with very nice graphics and well-curated very well curated
 and I on the walls there is reading these messages that were around that starts with these last teachings as he was about to pass away his last instructions
 so there's a lot of them but I thought I'd just highlight some of that was okay last words he said
 I don't think this is the very last words he said but kind of it lasts for more
statements that okay very interesting
 I just read some of them
 in order to satisfy the transcendental senses
 of the one non-dual supreme truth
 remain United in following Radha
 the original Reservoir glove for him
 yeah yes I do everyone make the effort to perfect your worship of Shri Hari of Chris make this the only purpose of your lives you know that now that purpose could play out in a wide variety of ways it can take a play out in caring for others and so many different ways of but that's always the purpose right what was that thing we quoted some weeks ago
 the rebels about the revolution do you remember that one like it's always about the revolution or something like that and
it will be televised that one no not the Gil Scott-Heron
 it's always about the revolution in other words it's always about anyway these are Christian maintain your worldly obligations and whatever way you can
 beneath Eternal principle
 Devotion to Krishna the true provision for your Voyage Through Life and in other words you know there's so many rules and regulations in this that but in the end
 just do what you got to do to maintain your world obligations in whatever way you can
 but make the Eternal principle
 The Eternal principles devotional Krishna the true provision
 for your Voyage Through Life let hundreds of dangers insults or persecutions come
 but despite them
 do not give up your butt
turn to Krishna
 and these are deeply realized instructions you know someone who really went through it in life and it was so incredibly inside mean this is the heart of a of a real bout to you
 torture Tanya destroys all obstacles on the path he will surely be merciful and give you a place that is lotus feet when you see that most people are indifferent to Sri Krishna and show no interest in selfless service to Krishna and it talks about him don't be discouraged most of all never give up your badge on your life so
 why would you accept the poverty of a life without hearing and chanting about Krishna your soul wealth y r o d y
 bag for krishna's Lotus feet the ultimate benediction for all living beings the Lord is all-powerful and
fulfill your desires Chris is not incapable he is omnipotent and his service is I was never go in vain I'm going to beg more I've got a bag Krishna Krishna come on Megan there are trusting you no better off for it has been my observation please always chant the name of the Lord being humbler than the blade of grass and more tolerant than the tree
 give all respect to others and demand none for yourself
 make the worship of the Holy Name the most important aspect of your devotional life
 is purifying here this isn't it it's just like No Nonsense just like
 speed a little bit more
 show the potty but no talk where's the best of the followers of Sri Rupa goswami
the pure joy devotional service comes in the Stream that started with him
 that stream is Holy and full of nefertari and flavors of devotion
 even a hundred obstacles will never obstructed
 that's what's happening you know we are new to this we are come from all kind of crazy backgrounds and warped experiences with a twisted somehow we find ourselves caught up in that flow that pure joy of devotion of service started with him and then we can taste some of at least to drop of that nectar the neck Terry and flavors and devotion nothing can stop it intelligent persons who have babies
within the Waters of that stream
 should Endeavor to fill the hearts of the heartfelt wishes of bucks even though topcor
 I'm so good while living in this world we may encounter many difficulties
 but there is no need for us to ever be bewildered by these difficulties
 we need make no effort to remove any of these obstacles
 what is necessary for us while we are still here
 is to learn what is beyond what will be the nature of our eternal life is interesting there is a Beyond there's a Beyond as much as this world seem real seems real it's a reflection on us when we have this great analogy that I never heard from you listen to Radha soami lately
 and he had this analogies like there's too much of Benin
best mint
 in the reflection yes instead of what's real like you're putting makeup on the mirror and lipstick on the mirror at what is it at once you move your face you could realize like this is a stupid what am I doing that behind it and it's nothing behind the mirror our whole life is an investment in the reflection and I've been enhanced in no way myself no it's ever everything we're going to lose
 that's Grandpa we become as humiliating after while and so it looks it seems foolish to anyone observing and shirt and she'll about to sit on tastes just like this breath of fresh air is like I'm walking in and I'm not going to Pander to your you know to do whatever the latest new age talk is or what you know I'm going to bring your mind to reality
 okay he says let me realize at this very moment the nature of my eternals
