 spiritual wisdom relevant relevant today making spiritual matching ancient wisdom relevant and fun today
thank you for playing an integral part of my life and helping me become a deeper and more mature person and a devotee and general thank you and an anonymous Russian person out there my bride
 my bride and I have a question for you say West Houston election did he do you write this letter like during the wedding weight bride is are you married yet or they are Bride for a moment in America at least that's how he saved your bride the day of your wedding your bride after that your wife before that she may be like in the planning of the wedding like you do a rehearsal or something like that in the garage I got a question probably means newlywed
 or a fiance maybe I'll be honest I think you sound funny on say
thank you for explaining Krishna bhakti a way to slow. Thank you for putting it into my bride my bride and I have a question for you to get in to get initiation to initiations when you get into boxing for a while you find a guru and the guru gives you a name and it gives you initiate you into the practice of device do I need to practice so officially
 you have to wait you have to chant the pronoun mantra for two years okay but I'm unsure is the muncher to the guru essentially what they're saying is that there's a two-year period where you've accepted the guru the Brewers accepting you but they're still kind of like a trial period before the groomer says okay you're in and so you're changing the print on launching means
 it different times you know we put in different ritual simple rituals you do or something like that you're offering your your respect to your Google with a particular mantra
the idea is that
 they're chanting 16 rounds as two hours of chanting japa pretty much per day with it meaning he there made that commitment everything was going good for my bride during the first year but it became someone above burden she became tired of all the rules and all the regulations concerning the initiation especially chanting 16 rounds it's a lot when I lived in a temple it was not a lot it was
 because you don't know what time everything's exclusively for that everything is for that you have time blocked out in the morning for Joppa but most people don't live in temples and so to get an extra 2 hours in their day
 unless it's highly highly play artist is very very difficult even when especially when you have a child your young child give to young children you have
wedding rehearsal so kind of things going on yeah sometimes it's hard for her to complete them because she has to go to university right now works as a kid in the max plus she's living alone until we both finish our University and get married in a year's time that cleared that up okay yeah she thought maybe because it's her lack of organization but it's not just about to my mind it's hard just to finish the rounds in the morning and during the day she has to chance sometimes at night if it has 16 rounds
 as is expected she feels like she can't do it anymore and she has a taste for chanting but the imposition of you have to chance 16 rounds seems not to Aid her in her spiritual life but to make her feel a sense feel tense and stressed about having to finish around it'll can also make a person feel I'm just not good enough and I'm just
I can't run faster Bay perhaps their own feeling of I'll never make it to this bar so she decided to lower her standards and chanting around to do the best you can and that makes her feel guilty because she chance to print out muncher to her Guru at the same time it is not a she's not able to chant it now she doesn't know when she'll get initiation even if she will get it she fears that she won't be able to follow through with their vow because of similar impediments that may prevent her from chanting 16 rounds do you have any advice your help would be much appreciated all right
 do you want to start running with you want me to start
 what you just said Hassan you start is that what you said okay if we're suffering from this feeling of I'm not good enough which is sort of epidemic feel like I'm not good enough
they really
 hit hit a nerve
 because the standard in bhakti culture is high with very high standards a lot of rules for everything and you can just feel like you know what I can't make it so I don't want any of it don't go there I'm just going to say that in advance don't go there jump high we're going to ask you to jump I but when you jump high expected for short that happens when you have to jump high sometimes you fall short that's okay there always will be attention like I'm never doing enough but don't let that tension make you say you know what I'm just not going to do it we're just going to do it now I've had times where I just can't finish my rounds and and people say while you know you don't want it I don't want to know sometimes I'm preaching all day long and I can't finish my rounds and and I just have to accept can't do it just I can't do it today but
I just been going to give up on my body give up my practice and in just jump right back in the next day especially if you're going to University have a job you don't even have a kid yet I must say you're going to have a kid but if you do you are going to be massively overwhelmed it just happens so there's a reality there is what's ideal and there's what's real
 and if if this attention is making you say no and I'm just not going to play this game I'm just going to try another path another Guru of people are a little bit more understanding I wouldn't recommend that I'd say have that 10 to make it to be a healthy tension and of course if you have a guru that's inspiring you can just print out mantras I can print out mantras I give print what is a pronoun Mantra it's a prayer of appreciation to a teacher in your life
the cooler is merciful to go to understand that I can't make the cut today the guru understands that does that mean we shouldn't offer respect to them of course we should now we're trying to jump I and II say JUMP as high as you can heal your life with your duties of this world and always keep Krishna the Forefront of your mind and chant as much as you can settle our standard of Joppa and chant that on a regular basis you don't think Christmas Happy by that Christian is happy to agree you're trying to surrender to Krishna Krishna is very understanding Christians are persecutions of friend Christian is not a judge krishna's not you know what America we have the show called Judge Judy who who's like really pointing fingers and cutting people chopping them down krishna's a dear friend and he wants you and she encouraged in you
 and so there will be times when you'll be able to rise up even taller and
proper way to 11 years before he took initiation as well
 you know it's a it's a different world that we live in right now try to find some time really good solid chanting that you can hear and enjoy your relationship with Krishna if it's done in a funk three-way exclusively out of Duty
 you'll end up how you are right now sort of sad but don't let that tension invite the tension don't avoid the tension it'll always be there even if you were chanting
 16 rounds and feeling like you're following all the rules there still will be attention I'm not good enough that'll be understandable we can always go deeper
 try your best advice
 perfunctory perfunctory like that word you keep that means ritualistically
perfunctory how do you spell it perfunctory sounded out purfume characterized by routine or superficiality or mechanical word nerd word mean interest or enthusiasm part-time bought this Part Time Warner I'm I'm with you on this on your answer Rogan a thumb
 I I feel for for this bride apparently very sincere young lady
 you know
 are you going to say but now I'm not going to say about it I feel for her I want to try what what I'm worried about
 and what I want to help address which I think you already done Rugrat is I want
we need to understand the essence of exactly what's going on the essence of why we chant these rounds everyday the essence of what is this initiation the essence of what is the predominant religion why one chance it and I think when you understand them all
 then you'll understand why you do each one and you do them the best that you can and you don't feel guilty about it but if if we're if we if we're understanding them on any kind of superficial level
 then we may look like oh I didn't come up to the standard to be able to practice this no no no you know what you said right now is about 11 years before he got initiation that's I think that's an excellent point
 what is this connection between the guran the disciple what is deeksha right like what is the initial initiation yes the guru except to disciple the disciple except the guru
beads are given name is given excetera but the essential part of it the really essential part is that the disciple comes to a conviction right like a firm conviction that you know what I've come to understand something and it's so clear in my mind and it's so clear in my heart and that is that my material Endeavors in this world
 do not deliver that this is not the path that I want to be on in life that there's something much more important to something much more subtle there's something much more profound that has to do with connecting to Krishna I want that that's my priority and Anne and I want you to your Guru who inspire me so much and no practice this practices is so well I'm saying please instruct me in this cuz I need your help like that's diksha
it's not Channing 16 rounds weather channel one around or Weather Channel 64 rounds or Weather Channel 108 route that's the conviction that the disciple has to come to and if you got that that should satisfy the group the group should feel in their heart this person out of all the millions of millions of people roaming around this world this person has come to that condition they understand and they're asking me for my help I have to help them that's that's that's an issue right okay you understood I can tell how sincerely you've understood it
 I'm willing to help you here are the instructions if you need to follow right now there's an Institutional concern that provide had that he was saying okay I need you to check in at least 16 rounds and that's become the standard width in this particular branch of iskcon 22
in one sense there's no getting around that you know ideally a group should just be able to help anyone in any situation and they can
 it's not like you don't get that help until you chance 16 rounds you can't chance to print on lunch or which is the ideas that I need to remember my I need to keep them focused in my conscious is so when I get up in the morning I chant this month or when I offer my food I offered to God not directly but I see myself as an assistant of my grew making this offering so I chant that much when I entered the temple room I'm I'm entering by the blessing of my group I chant my gurus Montrose you know it look like this is as if you have that relationship with your group weather channel one around today or 16
 the net monster you chanting a mantra for the right reason reason and it's in its playing it's right it's helping you in the right way in your practice
 and so I get it
I think you know a sincere group would be more pleased and satisfied and confident that things are going well with a disciple that chance eight rounds a day that has a full schedule like like like this young lady has you not go to school and I work and I have to take care of the home I have all these things I need to do and I'm staying up late trying to chancey's rounds totally inattentively stressing myself out now I'm running around in a ball of stress 24 hours a day and it is just too much if so if that person said I've been trying it so much I'm on 28 rounds now but I want your shelter I want your instruction I want to follow this path as you direct me
 I think that group would be very pleased and maybe more but even more pleasing some of this channel 16 or even 64 rounds
 that's still hasn't understood things clearly you know still hasn't still hasn't really surrendered when we look at the initiations that
Play Step 12 disciple approaches the guru it looking treat on your charts and razor you know Street I tell you I'm a fool before my girl you know you tell me what to do Channel a girl told me to tell you this much that's why I do it tonight and go swimming who am I everybody is calling me on the learning person he was this huge man in the government when he approached his Guru I don't know anything you know I all I know is that I need your help to get to escape this cycle of birth and death please instruct me that's dijkstra that one when one has a conviction and it sounds like this lady has that conviction I would suggest that she you know it one of the problems in the difficulties is that sometimes nowadays these groups have thousands of disciples
 scratch what I would I would suggest as try to get some time with that girl even if it's 10 minutes and explain
situation say I have faith in you you've inspired Bucky within my heart and we could buy hearing from you you changed my life and you give me the conviction that the path of of of bhakti following in the footsteps of Sri chaitanya that's the path that I want that's what I want to make my life
 and I know to be initiated by you I need to chance 16 rounds every day and I've been struggling to do that I've been feeling guilty about it can I have your shelter even if I'm not Chantix 16 rounds can I can you know if I want at least right not right now you know can I gradually build up to that but can you still be my girl can I still be your disciple you know even though I haven't been given the name and haven't been given you gone through the ceremony can we have that connection I would just ask it in my my guess would be that the guru say yes you know you know I accept you as a disciple in and I'll train you in this in and let's workout
it may take 11 years if it takes 11 years that's okay may take more
 got to be okay with 11 years yeah that's alright right on time but you got the shelter of the guru that's that's the real initiation like that that's the real initiation so why I don't feel guilt you know I mean a little this there's such a thing as like a little healthy guilt or a little a little healthy kind of lamentation in the heart I wish I could I wish I could you know I need to do better than that if it's if it's making you want to do better that's good if it's making me think I'll never be able to do this now it's working against you that you got to sniff that out we got to Snuff that that's that's not helping anyone you know you're you won't please yourself you your your group won't be pleased with that attitude either you know so just see if you can have that conversation see if you can explain yourself clearly I want your shelter I can't chance 16 rounds now I've been trying for over a year and really hard but
your shelter I really sincerely system seeking your guidance please help me and see what see what happens then
 don't and don't worry about the social stuff all I'm in a group of people everybody's initiated they all got their names I don't get all of that stuff don't you just have to get that should roll off your back like water off the back of a well-oiled duck or have you have your bride just private message me I'll give her a name that's what she wants to see me a 40 bucks you get a name who do you want one but that plenty of people who have very sincere question
yeah we we wish you the best and let us know how it goes like that

let's hear what she has to say Lord Krishna blessed us me and my hubby with a baby girl after recurring miscarriages you're blessed we feel immensely blessed and grateful for a ray of sunshine however the time is come where we find that we need to move back to Portugal beautiful country
 long story Hillary which leads to my question
 when asked what I will miss about America I always say Association Associates with the vote Association if you're new to this Club association means hanging out with the bodies on a regular basis
 what are they adding it in Italian for an association remember where they say in Italian
 company
 I was watching a class by much Avatar Google
it was an Italian so I can understand and tell me tell me more but I just kept hearing the word company in a company that's what she wants that's what she's going to miss she's going to miss you so station of hanging out with the devotees Body Center is such a nice Community unfortunately there is only to iskcon Hari Krishna Temple in Portugal and they're actually pretty far from where I live so my question is exactly how can I make sure to keep myself on the path and how will I teach my daughter
 her name is Krishna I like that one
 oh we're at the Christmas son love you
 and I really want her to know how that name came to be came beat him to be for her I wanted to be able to attend to your tongue or to visit other devotee
and it's looking so hard over there I just want to keep this feeling alive in me and I don't want to be busy with work life and no association that I end up losing all I have gained I know there's no magic recipe when one wants one will get it I just want to make sure I nurture this love I appreciate your wisdom thank you so much for making my day is brighter I will definitely keep listening to the podcast that's for sure Rob hey. Hey
 all right what a sweet what a sweet question Sophia I'll go first if you don't mind or not at all I'm going to say it and you going to set you can tell me make the cancel make your house the temp make your house look up to the iskcon temple make your own temple in your home that's one thing you can do here's another thing a lot
devotees who have kids do
 they leave their home and go to a place where there's a bunch of devotee kids people do that all the time when they're very serious about bhakti I want to raise my kit I mean my teenager whom I love and I love his company
 we thought it would be better for him to go to school in Alachua even though he's not with us he's lives with a devoted family they love him they take care of him they've got teenage kids too and he's got tons of Krishna France why not just take sole sole Krishna has to have I got Little Krishna dolls for her to play with I'll have her learn slow cuz I'm serious maybe give her a new name is inviting people to live with us
and it's really true though it were we going to we're going to have to raise our kids like to Bodie and encourage other people to become devotees or we're going to have to find a community or else was going to happen is you might raise a very nice girl
 was no attachment Krishna the grayish might be a good daughter but we want especially when they get older too especially when they get older when they're teenagers it's all about friends in lb you can remember when you were a kid at all. You just want to hang out with your friends you don't even interested with parents when your little that's all but your parents are dad but my friends if those friends are devotees they will have lifelong friends and a lifelong devotee friends I know my kids they do these bus tours there's a bus tours going to Europe right now this summer it is it builds lasting relationships does that last stand it.
and it happened my son so we're sort of don't have that many devotees up here they were kids my kids age of only a few but I managed to Usher since they had summer camps to always send him on Krishna summer camps and they still got the same friends for like 10 years old what about 8 I like this idea I think it's my putting up there on the chapel what about Super Soul summer camp totally into it make it happen Captain Tuit
 Sofia gets serious get serious make it you can do it you can do it here or call voice and begging for an hour and I could be like for a whole month or two months
 but why don't we just do it at your apartment or 2 weeks maybe
there's like shut off could still make burritos vegan meatballs
 who's the mayor of Maya and there was one more cars back in town okay that's what I have to say make your house or you move to a temple near Temple some people like doing that but she can't do that though it sounds like circumstance are low in it
 well I'll share tell add to that room that least something else so I think the way the world really works was if we get caught up in these waves of the material energy and we have an intention that I want to be Krishna Consciousness I want to dedicate time but you know the time just goes by
I think because you're in this somewhat vulnerable position where you can just easily run over to the Barclays Center on a regular basis you've got to be really intentional now I think you got to get out of calendar
 and you need to plan your year out how you're going to regularly get that song of how you going to get that associate you need to write it right down in the calendar and follow it right like look here's a whole month's coming up here in a month month of June where am I going to get that single or you know maybe I need to travel over there to get it okay I'm going to do that oh there's a holiday coming up in this day I want to make sure I spend the weekend at you know this place over there you don't deliver in David may be right if you're in your purse, do you know what I'm going to take a trip you do for jamash to me I don't go to the buck to Mountain Manor you know and end on this weekend I'm going to go to the temple and Portugal is far away but I'm going to go ahead and drive that time and make connections there I would
then I'm going to go and spend time you know in India you know I'm one of the retreat's of wisdom of the sages does you know I'm going to set aside cuz I'm going to take that that's where that's going to be my vacation I'm going to bring little what is it again sole sole sole sole of Krishna and bring little Leo it it's like it's these are like fathers and mothers thinking gopal nundini send on the message board we'd move multiple times to facilitate our kids Association sure he doesn't live it right they are in the community of devotees he lives out on a farm outside of San Diego but Enis he's thinking okay family vacation
 but the backdrop is all bunch of devotees that were cool with then other cool you'll be it's kid friendly and it's Italy so that's why I'm on paper it sounds like a rod going to Italy
and I'm telling my kids are all going to Italy but not going to do it I would like to program the morning program got to learn to like that they're in it yeah and so start young start early with them make it fun
 try to have other kids around the actual The Message Board is lighting up and I'm not to put it put it out there for any qualified parent or teacher who wants to do something like this or any kids I'm totally it's a super so far I'm doing stuff like this I love kids love camps and their psyche and can't change my weeks and I wasn't even a Boy Scout camp was great it was like one of the best times of my life he seemed Maris like picturing picturing I'm walking through super so far I'm like Jesus and the children are all the rest
snake around my neck a little like there's Shiva the little children are running up and pulling on his little body, but you know in all seriousness I think if you approach your your your sunga with that with that level of intentionality you may get more out of it than someone that has like the song the right there all the time it takes it for granted because when you go for that weekend or when you go for that special day when you go for that weekend into your to do or whatever you've been waiting for you've been anticipating it you're going into it saying I want to get the most out of this you going with genuine appreciation you're appreciating it may be more than the others to appreciate
have it all the time and in you really you notes we see it all the time like a threat someone comes to take it to one of our retreats in India and what happens in a in a couple weeks equals years of practicing you know it is it's what happens internally for them it's it's it's like a really increased rate of connection you know if you are in so so you can find it and also course you know you're going to have to take advantage of what's online and that your fortune and in these days no popery covid what does speak of you know if you go back Decades of this kind of stuff wasn't available post covid there's a lot of great song online so take it online when he get it be very intentional don't let the time Subway write it down in your calendar and follow it
 you'll get a lot of good song I think and you continue to pray I'm going to do summer camp every year like a little kids and big kids
teenagers booty unicorn charge
 and I'll be the cheese and then we're going to have like the bad kids the bad teenager camp and Gigi's in charge of that one and they got scared straight they got to stay in the Airstream
 no way there's camping out under the stars and Gigi's going to have them like doing like a tree to tree like really dangerous things that create like a bonding amongst them instead of like inner-city crime that would be kind of scared straight type of thing Scared Straight getting ready to face did you don't need Krishna that's what I thought to look at me now he going to be like me you're not careful
yeah I do okay back liar
 Krishna
 all right you got 10 minutes to take one more look at you mix up the wrong people Sofia this is Geva
 all right
 yeah why not Ronnie looks so
like she could be established Giovanna but nevermind he's mean
 I love Gina that I'm intimidated by air
 location
 I was waiting on my old hardcore friends yesterday they're all out there in the car yeah scrubble and Watson are are Casanova christhemike Morongo
 everyday all the old school guys are out and hanging out with the guys you hung out with 40 years ago and you trying to say what that's made my squirrel all right let's get one more question before you go off on some more tangents
yep he's a regular Zoomer
 now now he's our sweet baby Krishna regular as well
 when something when something is offered to him the offering so he's quoting from something that we you know where I got this question was I actually took it from the chat board
 from some time I think it was this week when we're hearing this description and Bob and Tom were provide was saying that when you offered to God
 it's like you don't lose anything actually you gain so it was it was like saying when you when you decorate your own face in the mirror
 either one you decorate your own face your face in the mirror also is decorated that that was that the contacts go ahead read it now
 when something is offered to him the Lord the offering by the Lord's Mercy is for the benefit of the devoted to give an example if one space is Decker
the reflection of one's face in a mirror is also seen to be decorated okay so it in the analogy
 the reflection represents the devotee and the real person that's being decorated looking into the mirror represents God right and so one of the face the real face is decorated the face in the reflection is automatically decorated to
 you can't decorate a face that's looking to mirror without the reflection also being decorated gets just as decorated connection between the self
 is my God yes and will but here's the idea that we move through this world with a strategy I need to collect things for myself to be happy or external things when of decorating the mirror MAC lipstick on the mirror
version of Rockin off in and when you decorate them damn reason Mirror Image the real image doesn't doesn't get decorated at all right right but when you decorate the real image the one in the mirror all is also decorated like serving the ego there's no benefit for anybody in the God we don't because of the material calculations we just lost it
 but the spiritual calculation is no no no whatever offerings coming right back. It's like we're benefiting from it only lasting benefit right
 it's the only lasting benefit to offer everything to God and you won't miss a thing
