Calm great so our special guest today is an old friend of mine but he's more of a teacher of mine so I will say he's friendly to me but Edwin Bryant Professor Edwin Brian received his PhD in Indian languages and cultures from Columbia University where is thesis culminated in his first book The Quest for the origins of viticulture Oxford University press
I was in 2001 he taught him to his with Harvard University for three years and is presently the professor of Hinduism at Rutgers University where he teaches courses where teaches courses on Hindu philosophy and religion is probably eight books I was getting so arrogant about me publishing a book you published eight books and author and a number of articles on the earliest origins of the viticulture yoga philosophy and the Krishna tradition these include penguin World Classics translation of the story of krishna's incarnation from its traditional source that you meant by the term piranha what we study every day as a personal practitioner body for over 45 years and number of them spent in India study with traditional teachers were he returns yearly Edwin strives to combined academic scholarship and rigor with appreciation towards traditional knowledge systems
Professor Brian welcome to the show
 thank you Raquel JC Krishna you know to be here you're all looking great and yeah you doing great stuff so nice to see your radio show is on going spend a few years now I think
 we can't stop it keeps going and it keeps morphing startup podcast it has turned into a more of a community of people we have this age groups we have Retreat we have pilgrimages and we're trying to develop it more and more but I will say very very inspired and impressed and excited that you agreed to come on the show again I find you to be one of the few people that I can shut up for and just listen which is rare cuz I should shut up for very few people in this world and and besides being alerted and
having having wisdom which people really need in this day and age I find it very entertaining and fun to be around so it's glad to have you on the show because I think a big part of teaching is the way you disseminate that knowledge and you do with wit and vulnerability and I really appreciate you
 thank you Roku that's quite a Litany of compliments and you know likewise I have great regard to you and your service so yeah let's hope we can keep doing this until I get our hair gets whiter and whiter still and then eventually pulls out and then if you could see how we can still keep speaking and sharing the bag with Tom and until we croak and then let's hope the town I lost I lost the last breaths our last Chrome Flames oh yeah I hope I hope it will be I had a story of my life when I first got into bhakti
I was at a farm community and I was with a family a mother and a father and to see them under non teenage kids like 8 and 10 and I was a new brand new box and we are chanting driving through the winding roads West Virginia and all of a sudden this dear popped out we all chanting japa even the kids and the deer popped out of nowhere and everyone just said at the exact same time richner except me where I just said I said some horrible curse and a I was just reflecting about what's going through my mind and what was going through their mind so yeah I'm praying that they broke something Transit dental and UConn
 that was how many years ago that was 37 years ago maybe
 so that the whole point of solder is it in
but if we keep repeating that the name every day every day chewing Choppa then that Krishna some scar to become stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger until it becomes a massive great big cluster of some scar has good moment to death you know the things that are most important to us rides in the into our minds when will you know the body's falling apart right because we've with choking we got tubes going until I said that moment what do we cling onto we're going to cling onto the sort of the strongest than the most powerful samskara and that's going to be the one that we've developed in life so sadhna is all about having that Krishna some scar there but you didn't have 35 years ago because you hadn't really started your your life of sadhna but by now I'm sure that that that that that pivotal moment the great friends that do you punish a recorded that gray Transit and we cling on to that most powerful the most practiced most consistently practice some scarra the name of Krishna
 that's so good to hear
end in I didn't realize you wrote that many books and I'm very impressed can you tell me at end of diverse scholarly books what would you say are some great takeaways if you had to put it in a nutshell if if if you're actually old are not fully we're not fully old yet we're just older but with we are fully old and disseminating some information or you're telling it you're telling a teenager here is the important things you should take away do you have something that we can hold onto
 in terms of literature no in terms of Life Lesson the life lesson that could be like something you'd give to your to your son on your deathbed something like that there's a lot of reading out there so what would you extract from that reading that could be very practical and useful as for us today on our perhaps on our material I fat
store in terms of the material life that everything is temporary and therefore everything is on for filling and that's the first noble truths of Buddhism and it's I think the pivotal verse in the yoga sutras it's right there in the Gated Ocala a massage with them so that the from the point of view of material life I would I would say pay attention to your quest for happiness in the material world and even as you're out there striving to find happiness keep a little bit of a wisdom a boogie in all wisdom to the witness and and honest with yourself and recognize that nothing really truly fulfilled and satisfied in the Deep sort of way that I heart Raves for I noticed that continues to be the case continues to be the case continues to be the case and a certain point when that is that Continuum has been over 10 20 30 years then you get the van at least consider the offer with the teacher
of the of the about a tradition which is that's the very nature of out of material existence that can never satisfy so that would be my material kind of little titbit the first Noble Truth of what is a true words are balm to come send two words and put the police are bound to come everything is a feeling materially and then from a spiritual point of view is latch on to Vagabond you know what I think that you know the boxing are two suture gets a quintessential definition about t always remember Krishna never forget Krishna and when you forget I was thinking. I suspect spent a whole day and I didn't think of bugs live on even once so that seems rather what would you say
 what have you distilled water what am I distilled thanks for asking yes keeping that as a minute
that's what has you were saying like everything everything if you're on your deathbed and your son or it's somebody approached you and you had 5 minutes left to live and you just had enough Prana to share one set of statements to your beloved's you leaving the world you never see that beloved Son or beloved person again what would be that final that final you know what sound B okay B that I would push it exactly what you said towards the end that Krishna is actually your best friend Christian is your your greatest lover Krishna is your Source Krishna is your joy in any sadness in this world expect it turn all your love over to Krishna and he'll protect you I think that I think it would be something something like that if I have longer I'd sort of like teas that out a little bit more
 yeah and if you had a little longer you read the whole bag of it's a piranha.
I would take you up on that would take that made that you wouldn't be on your deathbed at that blank yes yes I was speaking about remembering Krishna are you celebrating John Marston me tomorrow
 you know I've become very romantic and I pretty much a solo kind of solo bag of Italian or boxer or aspiring one and because my house is such massive disorder right now and I'm leaving the country the day after tomorrow I'll just do something I have some fruit in the garden that is pure organic fruits and I will do a little offering and I you know I'm I'm not I'm not doing anything I'm not near the temple I'm going to I'm in the middle of nowhere so it'll be very personal and very just me and Vagabond and and I relish that like that that I can see that as being my future anyway
 yeah yeah how about you we're both going to drink I was going to do nothing and then
I know I should go to New York and coasted courage me to go to New York or it's really festive truthfully sometimes when it's very festive I feel less connected to God I don't know why but it's because maybe I'm just in a social mood or maybe I'm ego-driven I'm not sure but but yeah it's these alone moments but I'm the 11th hour we decided just to invite people over so we're going to have just we're just going to have just we're just going to read and read and sing and that's going to be it just reading and sing it or a few hours every night you say hermeticism in the future you or do you want to see yourself as being socially active in and having you know these kinds of community kind of get-togethers and the farm in the sort of creating these opportunities or do you file find your inclinations as you becoming older 2821 Solitude and hermeticism
 I feel like
b r e a troll in your life your devotional life heading in a particular direction
 I'm interviewed by the way in case you didn't know about me again or and I I I want to die preaching that's why I say that's spreading the glories of Krishna I wouldn't mind dying like that that being said cuz I find it incredibly joyful and I find it keeps me and my best Consciousness that being said there is sections of me that are pulling back a little bit and truthfully I could probably see perhaps if I actually don't like you know there's a lot of ways to die until you can just one day
 die or get run over by a car like attacked by packs of dogs I thought about it all all these things can happen to me when you least expect it or I can die like through old age and one day it's obvious like okay it's about to die
so I could see if I do that half I could see myself winding down to be a little bit more private but I feel like if I've got energy in this body at least it's my that's what I find my duty to be but I find that I have a desire to be a little bit more quiet a little bit more in sealer and I find great joy in that as well which I wish I didn't previously I really felt like I didn't appreciate the value of being with yourself and with God
 yeah well said I'm a party person and Krishna Consciousness is I would be like kicked out of every Buddhist temple I think I'm not sure if they party as much as we do in bacta yeah
 what's the cultural cultural situation that's appropriate for you
yeah I don't think as a Moana Bubba with his people who don't speak have you ever met one of them
 yeah I mean there's lots of bubbles in the end even in bring the oven is all kinds of you know this hermetic characters I mean you know the Bentley brought it tradition can a compass anything hidden, and come to Encompass you know magnificent temples but you know huge crowds on Jam Master me to solitary Mona bubbles you know I can go over down and and so forth so really it was at that goes you just different modes of fixing the mine done by Gabon as long as you fix a mind above on that you know people's nature is nature has a different and also stages of Life a different Raghu right even in the evenin them in the car you know the stages of like themselves you know transform are you know personalities and Ambitions and goals in the end you know what does become more contemplative and meditative even in the varnish on system sure
I got ten years on you how old are you I'm 58
 are you are you have to give me you have to give me the get to give me the number I have to give me the the op in Hindi the polite form I have done 10 years on you know I'm kidding well if you do 67 okay I found things change a lot of people find 60 is kind of a
 a kind of a milestone where the body starts here if you start realizing that it's not just the just things happening in the body or you going to take that you start realizing this is age and your and you get to the realization and you know that and then all the sudden you can't you wonder how the hell you wonder how will how will you able to do everything you doing even ten years ago you would like how was I packing it into a day so they just changed and we're forced to
change by a very physiology with forced to change there must be some something in nature itself that is propelling US towards slowing down animal contemplatively life towards the end because the berry physiology the very body is set up for that
 yeah witnessing your own body change witnessing your little kids bodies grow and their desires and how they were so needy on you and now they're sort of like doing their own thing that's also helps me sort of helps me sort of let go as well but definitely even the passion the months for like a rent check when stuff like that right so we know the Bible better or what would you like to talk about I was talking about the back of a time to tell me
why do you love the why do you love to shoot my baggage from you study so many books why why is the bottom of time so special or not just for you but for for all people why is it important book to read
 you know there is the Mahabharata makes his claim that what is found anywhere else is to be found in the Mahabharata men in the Mahabharata there are things to be found that are not found anywhere else which you know is quite a grand statement to make but let us recall if yes when he sitting on the banks of the beginning of the bog the time the bank the banks of the whatever it was the sun has 50 is despondent and he's written the Mahabharata is written all the time it's just cuz he's written he divided the one Vader into for these divided the old piranha into a team as a whole school of disciples you know roma roma heart and all of these that are working on the different piranhas he's and he's done all of this and the tradition would even say
which of course I could damage could never accept because of unicorn logically but she says even wrote the commentary on the yoga sutras he's done with West Indies despondent and he's written the Mahabharata which has this Grand claim of containing everything and now that it comes down and says well the cause of your despondency is you think you've done everything including this Grand Mahabharata with its will it snow this great claim it makes but yet you haven't really described the pastimes of bugs live on and then. And then just writes the bug with them so in the bag with some you that's why we have brunch Lila that's why we have to go they could gopal that we fall in love with in the Mahabharat you have a hurry vamsa but it's not that it's a very different kind of Krishna Reddy you know what did it's a lineage that that pushed the story has been handed down in a different sort of lineage you don't have the Lila so you're in the same sort of way you don't have that rustles in the pubs in the Honey Buns her butt
bothersome the first I would say 30 chapters do it that's the that's the question of that's gopal that's little gopalakrishna so that that's that makes the bottle of time the crown jewel of literature on on the one hand but on the other hand it's got very you know I mean you know we love gopal and of course that he's in a heart but now we also have this kind of intellectual need for Ghana the bubble time is an extraordinary sophisticated you want to text and it has powerful Guiana teachings on how do you know you're not really delivered in a sort of very very powerful sort of way and I could just do I get tired of the yoga sutras I get your Mahabharata read it if you do you get your hair is brittle when you read it and you know Harry
arise oh that's fantastic but nothing nothing you know when you punish at the kind of cool in there to read their insurance and you know these ancient rishi's and the way they express themselves very different from latest literature all of that fantastic stuff that is nothing like the bag what time in terms of penetrating power in other words words into the heart and Inspire the practitioner both on a level you know to renounce the world becomes attached and on the back to level to then become attached to little lala little while ago Pollo G18 piranhas They all tell so many fascinating stories about
 gods goddesses Vishnu are they as attractive and if if
if not why not or are they more penetrating or if not why not
 yeah I think you know I can't I can only speak as a cushion of up to but I think we make a mistake if we think that there is no visible we disrespect by the pond if we disrespect the other forms of Bhagavad so both of us has his Infiniti of forms that manifests in order to attract people of different dispositions and different inclinations and different Bob's and so will their faction that we fail full for me it's Lala gopal we have to respect and accepted others feel for the great Lord Shiva for the great day the forms of Davie what is other forms of each one is free so I can only speak for myself you know it's like falling in love somebody says why did you fall in love with that person right you could have done you could have done so much better all you could have done you could have married into the next I didn't know you could have been up at what what can you tell him you
fall in love is trans rational it's a trans rational thing that happens to the heart so what is trans rational and you fall in love and so I would have to say that the other piranhas to me even the bishop new piranhas which is actually on its it's a table of contents room is the same as the bag of a time but it's so cool that you know it it doesn't have the same as not so literally Exquisite the baggage and literarily is exquisitely it doesn't have that sophistication that the of writing it for me it doesn't make me want to let you know really ripped the reconnected lie to my practice it doesn't make me doesn't spy my heart in the same sort of way I read it just to sort of you know be aware of its contents in the more should have academic so the way to the other piranhas you're asking a question for me fantastic I love I love I love the idea that all these forms are there I think we should give up this even language Supreme
analogy of God and frankly between you and me I don't think it's helpful because these phones are all the channel and it's not useful to go about banging people that you're brandishing the sign that our form is the Supreme Court cell phone mobile phone can do that but you know if you're in love with another phone that phone is the cause of all causes the Supreme personality for you and I could be sure that could be Davey that could be calling whatever it is so the prompt the wonderful thing about buxie and it is not one-size-fits-all as other August Monmouth monotheistic Traditions is one-size-fits-all you had to buy into a particular manifestation of God head or and that's it don't have any choice and Hinduism you have this fantastic variety you know even the body burn as important I see if they have that form of Lord Shiva and no one else is allowed to worship him he belongs to three burners and then he did his form and a very possessive this is a heart
about you know you put us down low on the social you stick your nose up at us you think we're a contaminated you think we have to let you know we're outcasts what we have our bag of an he belongs to us and and nobody else that you has the right to worship him in that and that's that possessiveness is is a is a is a hell of it's a wonderful thing about it was them there's there is a form of each for the every single community
 those stories are represented in the piranhas piranhas the great 18 model piranhas and then the 18 A minor piano solo stories come from there so for me by the B piranha that's that's when you know through whatever Destiny past life gray suit Guru that's in my own heart's right hopefully unflinching connection with that but for others you know we should let us honor or
not only encouraged if you know if someone has a partiality to shiver encourage them to be no guidance It Go British of a piranha go read the link of piranha gareda skanda purana call Rita Shively piranhas what's what's the death of our beloved issue how can we how can we how can we somehow denigrates you know or even just ignore the fact that I'll be manifest in these different ways how can we in any way belittle that
 what do you say Rocco
 yeah I would guess it's
 they're probably people
 teaching these these lineages I be just careful like who you direct them to because I'm not sure all I know is what I know and so I don't know and there is I'm sure there's a lot of Christian school's out there that maybe be a little bit philosophically off or philosophically deviant or have some crazy good
I'm very grateful I fell in love with prabhupada and proud punch teachings made sense to me so if someone said you know I want to worship Shiva or Davey I wouldn't even quite know where to direct them to find a more authentic School of Devi worship often times you get some person who claims they're into one of these demigods and this is what Davies about it's about embracing your own personal feminine and you know you know it's not about this patriarchal world we live in and so they sort of like co-opted a deity of Hindu deity and throw an Isis in there and and try to make it their own thing so I be careful to just sort of like I'm leaning towards that I'm going to go into that direction but I do understand what you're saying
 I just wouldn't know how to direct them sometimes people come to me and say I'm attracted to this particular Mantra and it could be any type of in a mantra Buddhist Mantra Devi Mantra Shiva mantra
what I say is you know all I can do is The Munsters have potency when they're given by a teacher understands their purport I don't understand the purport to this monstrous I can give you the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and I can explain the purport to that and I don't try to like convince them otherwise because like you said it's an affair of the heart it's what was it where do the trans trans rational it's love and therefore I can just share the love I have
 yeah but you know ultimately comes down to sincerity Rocco if people are sincere they will make a connection with with genuine teachers whether that be decided to just do what any other kind of teachers and all these other Traditions even the much and thinking and I mean one could just as easily be cheated with in it's gone think of think of all the girls of the Fallen something
90% so I don't I don't feel let you know anybody in this Khan has any you do very strong grounds for that then criticizing other TV and shall we say teachers because the same problems and phenomena are a very much have been very much a part of the historical it is convenient so I would say that you're really if you really truly sincere
 you let you know you surrender to East for an issue if you are hundred percent sincere Israel guide you to a bona fide guide whether that be in the Christian tradition or scheibe tradition or anybody else so really it's a matter of sincerity and if people are not sincere then they're going to get cheated wherever you sent them they going they're going to want you know they want some material desires satisfied or they really have some some kind of material idea of the girl is going to be someone that's going to fly to them or summer massage your ego or somehow both store in their metier
then they're going to wind up with somebody like that so I would suggest if someone is attracted to a mantra or another for no Mantra is the form of istra so if they're attracted to a month for a festival explained to them that that Mantra is a Sonic avatara its monthly Avatar other form of each Ronettes to Nama rupali Laguna that phone has activities has a shape has a form as it interacts with the world in a certain sort of way as qualities I would it's not just a mantra that mantras just 11 part of that package I would advise them to explore that whole package and but most of all Simply Be genuinely sincere and one hundred percent honest and examined their own sincerity and Israel will then guide the it's not you or me that's going to guide them it's going to be easy for that will come and capture their hearts whether it be in the form of dollar gopal or some other phone
I just think we need a lot less sectarian in the Gloria tradition in general and that you know and especially those of us that are interacting in the broader yoga Community where people are coming for all kinds of backgrounds that all kinds of different experiences they've made all kinds of different connections you know ultimately that going to be attracted you know if we are if they see our love and our dedication and they're going to say I want some of that but otherwise you know you know the Easter has many forms and it's a beautiful thing
 great answer thank you make sense where this is from and maybe you can that the monster has no efficacy unless it's given by a guru
 Yoda talking about when is the first day of the month
outside of that something that I sympathize some Pat Benatar something like that or something like that you know these kinds of statements are you often one of statements you know if you think that's four hundred thousand verses in the piranha there's 100,000 verses in the Mahabharata is half a million right there then you got all the other texts and then the commentaries you got millions and millions and millions of lines and then you find this sort of even the whole idea of the for sample diets Raghu it's not in the Bog the time it's one person the Vishnu puran so it's very for me and maybe I've become very broad-minded you know because of whatever you're not being an active demon and being to the mostly teaching you know not so much just so CA Chien with the golden record your Traditions except for my very best friends but that kind of a statement I find
 it's very hard for
I don't reject it it's very hard for me to put my heart into it because I believe in sincerity and that bag of them will accept any Mantra of it with sincerity sad to think that there's some technical process some technical lineage that if you don't receive it sounds a little political to me frankly it sounds a little bit about our it sounds about okay you have to receive the Montreal in this Pacific lineage because this because my girl comes in this lineage it start it sounds a little suspect to me and if it's true namaha that's fine but I certainly don't promote that I don't quote that purse I it doesn't speak to me it doesn't touch my heart and it doesn't sound like the kind of epoxy that an all-loving beautiful little while ago pile I don't think it's going to be a kind of a bureaucrat in that sort of a way so and I'm not dismissing it but I am saying it's not that you don't find
you know repeated all over the place it's mentioned once as far as I know and it's not our bugaba to text doesn't say that it does talk about I don't think the bog with him doesn't mention the 4th of December dies I think that comes from Department piranha but you can maybe can be corrected on that we can look that up in Wiki so it was kind of even if that's true I find them sectarian and helpful I finally put people off I find they make us a little bit latest they make us a little bit judgmental they make us feel privileged and they're not helpful to this to the spiritual life is spiritual life is humility and surrender to the Lotus feet above on so I hope that I may be that wasn't the answer you were hoping for but that's my feelings right now I think my my question was because I didn't want I didn't quite have an answer I didn't quite have an answer for that one for me I always thought well
the monster has more efficacy if it's explained why you're chanting this month like I asked you one of each a Acushnet what what does that mean so I thought that because then you can chance with an appropriate it in intention that's what I thought it meant
 not that it has to be sore like that's fine but anyone can explain the pain
 the Mantra is a Sonic Avatar it's it's Nam Avatar and it's quite straightforward is quite simple as nothing theologically complicated about it it is bag of on in the form of sound so if we if we don't that which means what which means we can surrender to the month in the same way you can surrender to the Morty in the temple and you can surrender another ways you can surrender your whole mind your heart your your ego Sorento to the name that's that's the meaning of the month it is no different from Bhagavad there's nothing silly about you
complicated about that and it done it doesn't seem to me that that is a some kind of a secret that has to be handed down in some very specifically defined a dike lineage so you know maybe these statements are meant to create some kind of it to safeguard you know that at least two lineages our ancients and their protective and we know where we know what following in the footsteps of great beings when we connect to these linear's I'm off for all of that I'm not dissing the whole thing but I but when it starts to become too restrictive into absolutist that nothing other than something received in the lineage is somehow inefficient and it doesn't have the efficacy at that point I can accept that okay it does right it doesn't seem to be in the it doesn't seem to resonate with the hearts of buck teeth which simply about sincere devotional surrender to someone that has captured your heart
in our case it's a little while ago pal
 so I had this brings me to something we were talking about yesterday and you were mentioning early you want to pick some fruits or some vegetables in your garden offer them to your deity and there's something wonderful about growing the food for the deity about preparing the food for your deity there's something nice about honoring and there's spiritual benefit because they're all meditations
 and we were talking about art there's something special about someone ask the question about AI art and nowadays with AI are they can mix things that don't belong together you can have a Vishnu with Radha Rani and then we'll just put it in and people don't know the rest of us are the mixing of different Russ's they'll just put things together like that you see sometimes airai art which is sort of out there and sometimes you'll see also
who are non not devotees of Krishna but they're just sort of painters selling selling art as well maybe even poster art and then we're talking about kirtan if there's people who
 don't necessarily they just look like here's the question
 do you get more benefit hearing a great Soul chanting kirtan or is it the hearer the intention of the here that makes the benefits so anybody could be better if anybody could be like for example if I'm looking at a piece of art that wasn't painted by a devotee but it's Krishna is there more benefit if it's painted by a great artist or is it just up to me and what I'm consuming through my senses
 doesn't make sense it's a really good question I would let me say something and maybe I have to rewind it and and fix it but I would say definitely
that's coming from a great you know that Bob the month is coming from the back because the mind of it because words are or verbalization of of the mine stuff mine stuff is British so I'm a great Mohan to Great Sage his britches whose mind is completely absorbed the back of a van that was that mindset that love is simply transformed from mental stuff into Sonic stuff into into the vibration of air but it's so it's still in Bude with that same love and it answers the Arab Akira and it touches the heart so there's no question about that that you know these the hit wonders from the great so it is going to be far more transformative then you can be you know for a devotee. He doesn't particularly like sitting in a professional in her some professional that you know the performer that Kaylee is is a lot of Eco in the performance
 having said that if if one is is an advanced about turn that wouldn't be me it might be you but if one is a very Advanced but do you see
everywhere I write this that's the automatic are you see Krishna everywhere so you could hear the name Krishna Caminos piece of art is completely hybrid the sleepy eyes that has no theological background to it you know but there's a flute and a peacock feather in a band and that will just trigger Bob like the gopis I didn't see a b a c a b in that triggered so I think is in those days the case but for neophyte devotees I think it's their advantages for them to somehow you know get get the association of somebody who is the inner deeply deeply deeply lover of Krishna so we can go both ways I mean
 yeah that makes sense there must be some dissemination of that Transit Dental sound from the Great Soul just hearing that are being around that
 you know when an acting instead of hippie care times I mean I used to I used to take a very
attitude and frowning it stick my nose up and think I was better because I had some traditional learning but now I think everything but most of it's all good you know I mean as long as the lineages that is a role for lineages I just don't like I just resist Lenny just when they start getting exclusive his stick and saying that anybody outside you know the Montreux is not applications I need to push back on that but the lineages as well as we perpetuate these lineages and then you know the hippy-dippy care times are going on in the yoga studio next door it's all good people that are sincere they going to want to you know at some point they're not maybe not going to be so satisfied with the hippy-dippy Cure time and they going to see something a little you know if that's sincerity is there they will be guided and then perhaps they will encounter lineages with people that I really really following me lineage what is lineage of following footsteps is this is a type of security it's a type of start things being watered down
mixed to a point where they're at the spiritual element becomes you do a non-existent so lineage is a preserve is a preservative it's kind of a preservative and as long as the lineages are you do alive and intact and you have Orthodox you know this was going to be a tension between Orthodox and liberal even within a lineage was going to be the author you know kind of contingent are you you need to write this up. I'm just my internet was not working so I was wondering if we have to turn people's cameras off cuz that sometimes takes away a little bit the juice
 yeah so yeah I would say I don't know I guess I'm I'm you know I'm a little hybrids Ragu World hybrids and I think that we going to maybe a good a good a good place to be is orthodox in your own practice and liberal in your teaching
please say more than one thing
 can I make a suggestion which may not sound very well sure especially if it's a suggestion for me
 it's for everybody can we eliminate the word preaching for my vocabulary because it's a festival that carries a lot of negative baggage from all the types of missionary activity which really messed up world cultures over the last two or three number one number two desert presumptuousness about it that that somehow it can lead me to Ego on the on the behalf of the person of the so-called preacher there's a presumption that the people being preached to us in some sort of way needy or or inferior it's a very short short step from you no sharing knowledge into thinking that other people are somehow inferior and develop developing and every once a car me if they're not a devotee so that's it you know you can end up in a
highly judgmental kind of mindset that to to to to shake off so I would suggest I don't even I don't even use the term teacher anymore because there's a little bit of that power imbalance and presumptuousness when I think the safe of myself now the safest kind of language to use is reading the text with fellow students
 I like that I like that I really preach today so I'm going to take this one person you know I went through a hole. Where I never said that word because I felt the same way
 and then I just left it back and we're like I'm preaching the gospel of the Bhagavad Gita and so yeah I think that but it does come with all the baggage of conquistadors and people have come even people come to India and try to convert people I like the concept of
we don't convert because raw Spirit Souls anyway with the texts are there in the mantras are there in the sudden the bhakti is there to help us remember just what we forgot but I like that studying how do you put it again with the phrase studying with your students
 just sharing this be the sacred texts you know and obviously some of us have been doing it a lot longer and so naturally you know we we we have more experience with the Texans but that's all
 like any field of knowledge oh someone has been doing it for longer they have more experience so it's not sure that they that they have you no more familiarity with the tax anyway it was just a part of that I'm sure we borrowed that word in all the translations because it up from Christianity and Islam that they were preachers and their preachers often times sometimes the sweetness and sometimes with a sword perhaps it was a different word in Sanskrit or in
in Vedic culture
 we have to wait for child right which is but it's not the same you know people didn't go they didn't convert if you read the stories you know Shanker went in and they had debates but those with debates between intellectual debates between the schools and not a captive he'll take them bigger has kept them you know where of their intellectual landscape but it wasn't really this conversion midget animals are purple with a little bit of an anomaly there cuz but you know I don't know about converting he just went around chanting and melting people's hearts I don't know if that would fit into what you know our notion of preaching you know he was an amazing being and people just melted and wanted to have what he had he was a people but still that love of God and wanted to have some of that but is that that's different from preaching where
you I kind of lecturing to somebody from a place that you believe Superior and that you're here somehow inferior listing in knots in one sort of way and it just leads the arrogance on the one side and on the other resistance let me know whenever you want to get preached to take this personally and personally applied to my life I feel like that God has spoken through you today for my benefit I think that's a great way and I'm going to eradicate that word for my vocabulary because yeah it doesn't it doesn't help me and it doesn't and like you said no one wants to feel like I'll just kind of lecture in me is that what's going on right now he's trying to sell me religion right here and it put you in a whole frame mind frame that you that's what you're doing instead of sharing some realization or Reading literature together
sure
 and there's so many you know now you ogre is so weak spread in the west and so many teachers are here is loads of people looking for teachings you know and if that sincere they'll find the appropriate community that with another guy that can shower you know with them that that is appropriate for them so they might come up with you and her or anybody else so send Veena will bring us together and whatever modalities reflecting our sincerity I think ultimately rug is he ought to be about it's going to be about since you can't convince people feel logically you can eat that you can satisfy their intellect but ultimate since Saturday at Serenity bug of Vandenberg oven catches the heart
 that's the core of buck to you all this other stuff is it doesn't mean it's not going to lost its you know just
theological intellectuality doesn't I don't believe make people to vote he's not hard to vote he's only God can make a right for those who also perhaps for those who also have that intellect and feel like oh yeah now I can be superior with my intellect but when your heart is there you see it even an intellectual who's got a wide-open heart like yourself and so appreciate that do you do you should just come up here a program with you or weekend and merge because you know I want more of you my life can that happen
 I've been saying that for three years that we can make it happen if you want to make it home okay and so how else can people that what's your favorite book that you've written that you
images of our students we basically started the ball with Tom everyday Yoga Yoga book was the sequel to The Yoga Sutra book do they have the same cover it's meant to be a set and it's the teachings that that feature yoga so it it's a no so those are coming out of a yoga tradition organic tradition because it's a lot of weird stuff in the Bible time where do I don't mean that other stuff that you know what you're around your on Yorkshire and you know and do you know the cosmology that is maybe not the best thing for an introduction to party Tales of Yogi so as the tales of you know drove through the Maharaj and pouted Maharaj the cool stories began of sections you know the merchant in the forest that sunk in the cupola so basically that has stories that resonate with the kind of text Nan is going on
the people are reading out there you know if it down to text or potential in a patanjali yoga sutras text so that's the stories in the back of a time that are good ridges to what's already out there so the buck to yoga towels and teaching is specifically designed for the non gordia yoga Community but I thought very very carefully for a very long time of the many years of teaching and that I would say give you a question was about my the my books and then that that is the is the thing that was most dear to me and he piggybacked on the yoga Sutra which I never for a minute so it was going to be so successful wow it is it's the most talked about yoga sutras Edition out there whenever I go to Yoga Studio C cellular Edwin Brian with this is the best one and I say yes it is
and then you get a check in the mail once a year
 for $86 an hour the manner he knows it's going to be okay was because I learned a lot about you know psychology in about Job her actually how to do japa and it just exploded I just never for a second dreamt it would look like consciously try to cash in on that on the success of that book if you look at the cover their identical and it was meant to bring the yoga Asana to add Angelic patanjali and Community create a link to the back of its a piranha that was the entire motive and strategic you do the thinking behind the blue book about to yoga book
