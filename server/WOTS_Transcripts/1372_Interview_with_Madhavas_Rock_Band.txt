so if you're new to the show Welcome is the daily study of the srimad bhagavatam and right into the interview I've been excited for this
 Nanda Ronnie welcome to the show Harry Krishna I just want my name is rocking off and I just want you to know I am your biggest fan and your biggest fan is sitting here in New York and I'm in my history is I was a professional musician for years and I had fans but now I am a fan and I love being a fan or because I never feel like I don't like make people wait for such a beautiful interviews but we are completely a social misfit that's what I call myself
so for so many reasons this couldn't happen but please accept my apologies once again you don't really do not want to offend such nice people amazing people like you putting in work and we never want to say no to such people actually get learn a lot of things from you today complete once again so sorry for being so late on your show peppers I see it like in tirupati tirupati when you go see Balaji there's a very very first you walk up all these Hills to go see biology and then you wait in line very long time 8 hours 10 hours but in that waiting there's a buildup there's a pressure there's a whole section and this is how I'm feeling today we don't deserve that kind of
we really do not deserve that since there's so many things on my end we've been doing all by ourselves everything that you and everything that you don't see your mother. Service is happening here so we are the ones versus trying to manage everything. So many people in the house but still nice like this place must see a possibility we want to hear the entire story today the show is only less than an hour at this point we're going to do it but we wondered extract as much sweet juice from you guys as we can so I have a bunch of questions and for those who don't know my rock band is my favorite band and what I think their greatest contribution
 is the taken these very very sweet of Americans very hard to get into Ridge boss
music but you've taken them and you put a Twist of westernization on them so it's very very palatable and easy to sing along with and often times you put the lyrics on the videos in English the lyrics on in Bridge boss and so you can find them along and I really really want to introduce all these American people that and Western European people that listen to a podcast to all of your music because I think your contribution and we may not even realize it but I think in years to come we will realize that mod is rock band has given so much to this spiritual culture and spreading the spirit throughout the world and it's one of the guys and we are very very impressed
 thank you so much for setting a shipping words really ninjala
gee maybe you can please explain
 how this whole thing started I know you are on India's Got Talent how did that whole thing start and maybe we'll try to find a link for that when he won the India's Got Talent contest can you tell me how it started as a band etcetera and then I'm not actually at the right person to explain it and I'm not the right person but he cannot wait to be all over from the same College we were doing our engineering and mechanical engineering architect engineer but I do know you're also materially talented now I'm going to get depressed now I'm going to
depressed but my reason for getting admission admission in engineering College was only so that I could pursue music because you let you get more time there than all the classes you can skip the lectures so that's what I wanted and second thing you know once we travel so long. Like 20 years together now we realize that Krishna always had some plans now. So this was the plan for which we met in the college and then I told them I'm a musician and my only thing in my life that I want to purchase music and nobody not at all close to music nothing
I was trying to make her sing in the right pitch so you can imagine she was not able to sing in the right place and everything
 massage you're the best you're the best singer in the world now in our college teachers told us you can only make a music lab in an engineering College if you have girls in the in the in the club and the college will be six of seven I was a senior in the college she was my junior so I instructed her to come and join this club otherwise you're not going to make this music up and go from there it started and fast forward to India's Got Talent we were in Mumbai singing songs in the back not many just feel songs because because we were trying to drive
it'll groom her more into singing skills because she was not trained musician earlier now where you already a couple at that time we decided to become couple decided to get married but that happen after we go to know you going to get married
 so are you playing Bollywood music with rain cover songs I was working with some Bollywood celebrities in Mumbai and apparently we wanted to use the skills that Krista have service in order to make some music this is the only thing you knew how to make music like I've been I've been making music for a long time now I learned all this music making skills to YouTube and put the logic pro and how to arrange music
wow and after that we went to Mumbai we were doing some ketonic local programs devoted to the congregation programs with performing some kitten in a style having guitar and drums with us so some person from India's Got Talent in this sauce there and then they process and the Bollywood music which was doing earlier but they wanted us to sing kitten on the show more than happy to do that because that was when you broke into the chanting and then it started as it started getting more like rock and roll they are because of the some scars of Indians in general they all got excited all the judges were excited
so they were actually surprised to see what's coming next Wednesday performing So Yesterday. Rise from there for them and then only after you just got talent we decided okay. We are doing Bollywood we're doing things to make out of a passage in the Bollywood to make it big also do something special other content Lake why don't we make some kitten because we know we know how to do it and we always felt like something is missing for the Youth in this entire spiritual section where the unit is unable to connect with it because of the reasons which we fight for their like the music the music Parts language and you use of the chance the super super powerful names of Warlock and then you just put the music which people can relate to and it was the perfect combination
click click at that point of time millions of messages and millions of dollars we stopped making about things that we will be doing in Mumbai you finally decided let's go to Brandon now we don't belong here wow that is a beautiful story and I think you're right there's something that clicked because even myself I've been devoting for decades now I became a devotee 1988 and I listen to Harry Krishna Montrose and end the iskcon devotees doing the kirtan and then when I was a young man I went to vrindavan and I listen to Ai endre and it's sit with Ing and chance while all I really knew was Harry Krishna kirtan if I was to go to Lloyd Bazaar and buy a cassette
some spiritual music or hidden in a it in Hindi or Sanskrit or Reds boss it didn't make sense with my ears it seem much different than iskcon music and you guys created a bridge from that trip music to an end and a real authentic kirtan and authentic Bridge bossy songs that's everybody can listen to nowadays my favorite being made up on my favorite song of all time
 before going to India's Got Talent I don't know if you know this or not we we have covered Metallica Guns N Roses Linkin Park AC DC don't tell me that I hold you guys up and it like like Mary and Jesus and Joseph don't tell me you covered Linkin Park
because because at that point of time we we had no Clear Vision about people we were just following the transport people look music and then Polly line into the street on bendable to Lisa's out there are so many amazing we don't understand how this whole thing is happening it's probably Christmas magic and that he wanted us to be just like professional just leave me like which I know whatever he wants you want us to do with doing it and it's krishna's magic that's what's going on here
and in your sincerity and your authentic city is a huge part of why Krishna has tagged you understands your heart and it's it's making such big wave and now I see many other people following in your footsteps but I really say you guys are leading the way not just leading the way but you're the best at what you do it it really is Vanellope forever here dealers about mother was in heart you always in a transfer disclosure personally because sincerely really honestly we have no part to play in this the whole time it goes to prison or absolutely nothing nothing I think me and Mara if you were to ask us why we were be like own under Ronnie must she must have been classically trained as a child in the way things and
dancing like you can't just learn that you got it that's got let's junmai you got to have this from birth your mother must have to teach you how to sing how to dance teacher let's see what I would be doing if you if you really is people who know us personally they know that the magic is happening because of krishna's Mercy otherwise there's no defense right that people working really hard and in Market in the business in many ways in all the ways actually so you know I also have I always have this fear in my mind it's even once ever if I try to take it
of all these things are happening. That magic back and going to get pissed off like right away so can I can I can I bring wine this a little bit I am very curious did you to grow up as devotees of Lord Krishna were you in spiritual Families how did you get turned on to this can you explain a little bit of both of your background you were completely from the Punjabi background I personally was like a full-on Punjabi person eating every single day of my life at Chandler's no connection with no devotion as you hear from people or ask Brooke what is also said even once in a lifetime future and Chris last name is surely going to you know, the part of devotion and
be a full-on Punjabi because I think an Indian there so many states Gujarat and Maharashtra and we don't even know what that means
 I do not want to offend any Punjabi watching this video of but I would say that Punjabi people live in Punjab, they just live their life to the fullest and full of passion and the food is very spicy party in fights and everything I really do not give that to happen because Punjab has also beautiful cultural Traditions there so many amazing things apart from Guns n' everything but yeah so we belong from that community and around here from that Community as well
yeah but not exactly like maybe I tried a few times meet but
 who was the father of I am still a follower of Lord Shiva because we used to have a big picture of a house and I was like what he's meditating on someone so that someone I want to know so then I can call it and then she introduced me do I buy a discount program in this car I mean the ghost program for City getting answers in the University end
 Nava it in the University also you got into this
person in the band I was at the office not to crack basically all of them chanting and everything you know and I was saying this is all of this is time wasted wasted the time you can't do that because
 so I wanted them to I wanted them to focus on music instead of doing something like going to Temple every day but I was I was not so like hardcore on them I would let them go but I will tell them don't we were allowed to tell him don't push me because I want to focus on music because you guys are not so musically talented and have to be the captain of the ship I have to go right the ship and make sure that it was everybody is is on the successful board because eventually the parents the family the society expects us to on money and I'll make the things successful whatever we were exploring news
everybody likes music and any creative talented stream is the is it kind of risky board on which you are selling you know you never know whether you're going to make it big enough for him because he's to determine if he picked up something besides thing that he will never going to leave that thing to be like okay he's over leadership of how they make me attracted to a devotion the word to us about what he thought everything was too young but my father refused Lucas everyday so just because something sweet for me and for that I was supposed to be back with you.
so that's what I did at that point of time as a parent Transit Dental bribery and you have children now do you have children that are in the band Yes we have a we have to see if you have a big family you got a joint family so we're cleaning all of them in different things whatever they feel like doing any music or making videos regarding many other things like that so we have one son do you know who plays drums in the band from the bank to is Constable engine I love her I love her
she's the only woman in the world who plays a really hard electric Bass with a sorry hun unbelievable she's so good just left the bank and I was really pissed off I was thinking like this this whole thing is so irritating that every now and then the band members will quit the band for their personal reasons right and I wanted a permanent kind of band and I was sitting at home and I saw my sister she was playing sattar know because she had this as a subject in our College music and I saw splinks classic sister do you think you can play bass guitar and she was like always so submissive to me although she's a little me but she was always so submissive to whatever I say she was it okay I can try
 that I that I showed her
the bass guitarist and from that day she left playing sitar and now there's a longest free guitar sheet for base and you know what's interesting
 she's using that big electric bass in Krishna service maybe even more than the sitar. When you play that electric bass in Monica's Rock Pond band as an offering to Krishna it is the most spiritual so you you live do you all live together together nice can I be part of your family part sew-in what was the first song that you created that it became very obvious like something's happening what was your first one
I think Jared a mother and there's a story behind but I always do that I don't care what you tell me after the podcast probably she's going to yell at me so it was a big fat because she just delivered a baby at that point of time and I was like a very thin and she didn't like it she said that no we're not going to release releases video because I'm not comfortable watching myself like that you know but somehow I'm not I'm not so comfortable let's drop the video
 and it's looking like a bunch of my my son
add the name of the song was dead on her mother it's there on YouTube so what happened and coincidentally we lost all the footage the video footage because the hardest got crashed and I was like maybe this is this is a part of this is what Christina wants me to just ignore this video but after a few months and go to retrieve the entire data from the hardest somebody help me doing that so I took it very positively and I got the video edited and without telling all of them I simply uploaded the video and nobody knew and almost almost 7 years on the top of the charts not the best on what channel and none of them expected that this is so high.
sweets so many people from there the journey actually started okay now we're all going to comment on it because I'm sure you did so I'm reading some comments coming up on the screen is also a big fan of yours as well so this is there was no as far as
 a marketing plan it doesn't sound like it was a marketing plan it sounds like you just uploaded a video or have to put some hashtags on there and then let the algorithms do the work was it did you have a scheme do you know how to upload videos so they become viral
in the year two thousand sixteen or Seventeen I was never I was never the kind of person who understand what is hashtag means what. What happens when she uploaded the only thing is I used to do back then was after uploading the video just put the refresh button so that I can I can see how many views of increased customer Creator do I have no clue how it works. That's what I did because I felt I felt that these people were sending so much of love so much of inspiration and appreciating appreciating of work I should talk to them so that I can understand you know I can I can get the fuel to the fuel that I want it so that I could do more of this kind of music you know
bring me hearing that kids and can change your life so many messages people getting my life, which was working as a fuel why it's changing lives and then then we go back to the basics which profile we have received emails from people who wanted to commit suicide but they change their mind just by listening to the music of kitten can be produced we still wonder why everybody
 I'm going to ask everybody to not only listen to your music today and I'm going to put my favorite song link up on the board but I want Natalie listen to read the comments on YouTube because the,
are very inspirational and can I share my theory here here's my theory about it I think in America men in the west we have eaten garbage for centuries for decades and decorate eating trash moving away from God even though sometimes we claim or religious we just become so decadent so indulgent so consumed eristic that weird and we've gotten so far from Spirit so far from God so got far from light and love and truth and balance
 that were desperate to just turned towards God but we're miles and miles and Croatia's encroaches away from God whereas I feel like an India it's like even your father you were saying on my father he had me read Bhagavad Gita to Sluggers add a right it's as if they're standing next to go
but facing the wrong direction but facing the wrong direction but they're very close and when someone like you guys come together and you just give a little push you give a little push and they turn around and the right there and then and then truthfully then sure the pro pods books are there and it explains the mystery that will be considered Hinduism Hinduism was a big mystery what does it mean who is this Swami and who is this a cherry and who is this Mystic master and and we get lot and probably explains it so simply and he had the incredible ability to write books that Americans can get that Indians can get in somehow somehow makes sense for both of us he'll write some things in the books that I don't understand but India's really get and they don't
maybe four Americans that perhaps Indians don't get a speaking to him and it's the perfect marriage of these two cultures absolutely true and your people from going through the hell America's been through because all we portray is all the glossiness and prettiness of the western living but we missed out on the addiction we miss you guys the media doesn't show that so much how people are desperate Heather lonely how they're addicted and have her trying to recover from all those things and we painted very beautiful pictures in in the minute and presented it as that and we put that as the carrot on the stick to make the whole world try to run after and I believe that Krishna Consciousness and you guys really leading the way in India has
I'm sure the romance of materialism and is quite beautiful and is quite inspirational problems going to appreciate us I will always reply. We are not doing a very strong person I cannot move him but if it if the strong person lets his body go very limp then you can move them around so when people who are the materialist is in their ego you can't move them but you guys have made yourselves off to krishna's desire and now Christian is just moving you around because your only interest is to serve Krishna that's what I'm saying and it's quite impressive
 thank you now so as you are going on you have some songs now what's the one that is your biggest hit right now is it.
what is your favorite City
 my favorite is Bunkie bihari but the other one
 yeah let's see how many millions of views
 the song and you know it it brings me back to all these beautiful places they shoot these videos if you haven't seen them they shoot these an old temples in in it in Temple Courtyards Sandy Sandy beautiful Sandy Gardens where was bunk'd give you her a shot is it was it was starting this but there's a village in the brexit results
but that it comes in the bridge in all these videos of most of the Galaxy and planets have you never thought they would make so big this thing is the best place to shoot when no one has the right place back in Mumbai we felt like let's go to Brenda Bon Jovi make music the most important place we should the videos their recklessness play The Past Times so that these videos become more powerful
for corten steel silly because we know that we have nothing in the house we have no Purity so let's let's bring out the the best and in the place where Christians do everything we do every single day of my life in the ocean in Lewisville park that is a very beautiful sentiment and now I want to ask you a question when in an American goes to India for the first time when we go anywhere for the first time it's only as there's always some interesting way architecture is where the interesting things about the culture that we don't understand but I got a feeling if you go
 I think when I went first went to vrindavan I was captivated by this mystical magical place I went in 1988 was before cell phones before before I internet's before television and before there was one phone in for nobbin there was one phone you could
it was unbelievable but if you're coming from India
 is it as exotic to go to burn Dobbin or does it seem like this is another Dusty Little Village how is Randolph and different or is it different than some other Village was I attracted to Christian I'm trying to find out if I was attracted to Krishna or just attracted to a foreign land what do you what do you think coming from India that there's a lot of villages in India why is Brenda Robin charm it it doesn't have that same charm for you and doesn't seem different than any other Village
 will bring the special to everybody not just Americans not any other country special even to the people who live in India and even to those who visited for the very first time even being an Indian everybody is always experienced this magic what you have experienced
so there's no difference at all even tell that when we when we depart, or when it will be just anywhere in this amazing place we still feel like this is unbelievable that we live in different places then actually we get to know the real importance of that place from the scriptures about Gwendolyn and where do you live in punch Grocer in Dothan area it like burned Auburn town
 yeah we live in the novel where do you have some favorite places maybe I will ride the town that you could share our secret place is perhaps why would I tell you about the secret places tell me
can you write me a private message please yes there is one place I can show you whenever you come here it's really a secret place of not many people know about this place so when I would like to see that so much of cloud and then that one because in recent years lot of people are coming in with everybody was scared about Brenda want or expected that kind of huge rush into it and it into the city like what's happening right by this before nobody has ever encountered this kind of traffic right complete which means they probably are used to play the Krishna is Krishna please make everybody got to go to have you please make everybody your disciple please make everybody Krishna consciousness
but no 5 is down the line but I see the entire window is choked then I am smiling at me and reselling me see just it's a small percentage of people are coming to imagine if the entire world and you won't be able to fit into I feel very happy that people are coming here in a magnificent actually and how does the how does the band just what do you do on a regular basis are you doing music everyday or do you say you know what we've done this project now we're in Vern Gosdin let's just
 I don't know what do you do if your living room. Go on pilgrimage every day
expected three years before two years ago because you know this is kind of a trend which which happened in India where people started calling us to play in the weddings and wedding the wedding's which we never thought would have ever happened I have all the videos it looks incredible that they would pay us for doing this doing this because it's it's a training thing happening in India right now and it's so good to see that people are calling Dan to perform Keaton in wedding instead of going out drinking drinking alcohol non-vegetarian heels and when you have some Spades rules for them that if you're calling us than there should be no liquor no alcohol no meeting
make sure that all these things are nicely followed that is beautiful music is so powerful isn't it it really changed the hearts in the minds of people it's very it's very impressive who's this incredibly impressive mentioned I think it's an 18th chapter 72 was the last local I don't do not remember the exact sloka in the Park part robot Dimension that Krishna says whoever is completely surrendered to me I bestow him with everything as well as material so I really believe in this because there was a there was a time when we were we were struggling to know how to arrange things for making these videos but now since we're doing so many concerts
no traveling and people are paying for the concerts and we have we have an expanding the team we are engaging more devotees there's more bands via grooming these things are actually happening and the statement which is mentioned in the bible gives you everything as it is actually we never ever imagined that this would happen mirror never sings It's a mirror Never sing so maybe I can say okay like an underground he never saying maybe this is your chance to step up Mira
 now you can be the one when I leave kirtan I'm not allowed to point to her to sing I'm not allowed to go she just has no please please you know I think a lot of these people know of religion is this spreading religion means I conquer your country and we put a
door to your head and we say join our religion or we'll kill you and it's so different is the way they baited culture doesn't convert with the sword it converts with the culture you fall in love with the culture and I think it's safe to say no one was threatened known that listens to this podcast with 1,000 people that listen to podcast no one was threatened you better listen to podcast or we're going to kick your butt they listened to his podcast cuz there's a culture that's attractive the music the food attractive the dance is attractive but the wind was attractive attractive her earrings hurt and you know what's really attractive the smiles on your face the joy that comes with bhakti
very very attractive you don't need to threaten anyone you just need to step into your into your spiritual life and that is the most attractive you're leading this by living to very true and so what's next for you guys
 this is over every month routine you keep on producing kitten like this is like from last eight to nine years every month bill is one music video no matter what we just keep doing it for the first time in nine years old and his journey that we haven't released a single video in last 2 months this is this is a different experience for us because the 22 months ago our spiritual master has passed and I just left a void unexpected thing for
Eliza realize importance of having group personally video physically present so we just tried to come back with this time please find ourselves a video of month is very very impressive and almost overwhelming because just to write a song and perfect the song takes time but to speak of make a whole video and choreograph a video and sync that in itself is incredibly impressive but yeah I don't know
 it's very difficult to explain digital if you see if you look at it as a work as something we should do as a work but if you think that this is the only service which may please Krishna then you have a big inspiration a no-good which with which you have a big push on you that you can
so for us it's been an effortless Journey actually then of course everybody whistle it's so difficult how do you manage your hard work. Just give yourself some time before us this is this is so cool you know you love me washing for the pleasure of Krishna I consider it as the best gift of my life you know we never get bored we never get tired we are always happy to listen to pull up enthousiasme what Lex let's let's do something amazing let's do something amazing in America and I have this saying
 the messages we are receiving the comments the feedback from people really works really work for us in America they have the saying thank
God It's Friday meaning I've worked all week and now I want to get Saturday and Sunday off thank God it's Friday but you do what you love and it's a spring for krishnam you can work 24 hours a day 7 days a week and just feel refreshed and inspired you guys are doing that and I don't want to I don't want to minimize the loss of your Guru that your Guru passing that must have been very devastating and I'm so sorry he lived such a gopal Krishna Mirage was your Guru correct he is such an incredible saintly person one of these amazing persons who just met probably pod and gave his life to probably pod and I had the Good Fortune of meeting him when I was young when I was a young man I got I couldn't get home from India I couldn't get home from Indy I only had $1
when will I be on the flight because I had four pieces of luggage and so I had no money I didn't know what to do and I I got I checked my the luggage back then you can put your luggage in some closet in the Delhi airport and I took a bus to the greater kailash Monday or Temple and I met gopalkrishna Mirage and he said yes you can stay here and I say thank you you said but you but you have to do some service and I said yeah I will do whatever any service you want so we had me decorate the rathyatra cart and I got to be up in the next day was Rafael Trujillo is Christmas magic and I was and I was on that card all night decorating and then it was morning in the card started moving and I got to do it Lord jogging up the entire day so that was a special mercy on me I felt the very very blessed
