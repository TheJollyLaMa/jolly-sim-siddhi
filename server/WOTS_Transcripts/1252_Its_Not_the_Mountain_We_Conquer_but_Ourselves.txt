Prosperity Gospel

 number at the bottom of screen we have Merrill be waiting by the phone to take your tax deductible gift
 okay Roman let's hear the Nugget who's the front today today is no get to eat is from I'm on the Broncos Peter Harris
 this is from Edmund Hillary Edmund Hillary was the song it was a New Zealander a new New Zealand Mountaineer explore and philanthropist and on the 29th of May 1953 he and Tenzing Norgay
you can the first climb is confirmed to reach the summit of Mount Everest
 Sky Zone a police have done it before they did The Nepalese are the guys carrying everything will that Tenzing Norgay he was a mountaineer out he was a sherpa Tenzing Norgay sounds like a guy
 no Tenzing Tenzing okay look that up Mara okay. They conquered the mountain and what does he say it was not in the mountains we conquer but ourselves a quote it is not the mountain that we conquer but I like how you're tying this all in to her any cashew Pooh my friend oh you think that's what I was doing well yeah because here is Renny koshy, in one sense
 O'Reilly's freezing them
well hopefully I'll be back soon is the problem when you go to places I go you never know what kind of Internet do you going to get so anyway let's talk a little bit about this you're not saying that I didn't say Rhonda cassey pulling in a sense I think we can't say that because we're worried about him and how you know he conquered so many enemies he conquered conquered enemies he conquered like planetary systems if he was like a universal conqueror but we'll see you know he didn't conquer the self in the end I was as that was as I read that
 is a red that nugget from from Edmund Hillary and I thought okay you know he's probably pretty thoughtful guy you do a lot of mountain climbing like that you get to the top of Mount Everest have some you know you think about life and you think about what you're doing
 and
 to climb that mountain you know I suppose
obviously it's like quite a huge accomplishment let me see remember I got that I got to see if I need to
 blackouts my wife I want out where hot spot in all doesn't blackout got you your hotspot in now
 how would you freezing up on us now
 yeah you're lagging guy
 in case so so saying you know you climb that mountain in this is his thought right is in one sense yeah you have to climb the mountain that's got to be some huge challenge
 but even from a relatively materialistic point of view what the mountain climbers doing is our conquering their own self their concrete Navy's their fears or maybe their conquering their rugged I see your your your leg. Big time we can't hear you
I don't mind that is anime
 this is when things break okay now he's going to get so it's so
 so you know the Mount Clemens realize you have me been conquering my fear to climb the mountain you know when climbing the mountain maybe I'm conquering my
 tolerance you know my ability to tolerate tolerate the cold tolerate or or even you know the Conquering one's own you know obviously you know you become tired and hungry and so many ways was not conquered in the mountain but they're conquering something that's internal
 but you know to go deeper still
 you know what would I like about this statement it's not you know the invite says climbing Mount Everest is kind of like the stereotypical kind of like like you know that was my Mount Everest or whatever you like that that that
being is like a a metaphor for overcoming whatever hurdles that we have in life
 and
 I think that
 what what again what I liked about it was that we could see anything that we do in life as as a personal project right like in other words and we hear from people all the time on this podcast people that are going to work that they want to practice boxy but I have to go to work so it seems like I don't have time to practice potty or you know taking care of three children and going to work and in and so what time do I have to do that internal work but from the statement you know what I take from is that anything that we do in life can become a personal project so in other words I'm going to work and I have things that I need to accomplish at work but it's not those things that I'm conquering really what
talking is myself and what is it internally over trying to conquer and when I looked at that you know I was I thought maybe I could share a little something my
 you know I did something for Vonnie for this online platform that we encourage people to subscribe to its they got a lot of nice content lot of our friends around their Bonnie b a n i s project Google vine.com but I did something for the I did like a like a course for them is like a 17 lesson course and then the to get that you have to subscribe to their to the platform but they also give out free content internet free content is it was a talk that I gave us about a 20-minute talk
 I wish I had a thing for maybe we could put the link in for this side in the in the details of this podcast
 but I spoke about what did the the title of it was three ways the sage is in
three ways of mastering the mind
 and those three ways are you know taken straight from the Bhagavad Gita the Mastery of evenness of mind the master of equal vision and the Mastery of the inner happiness writes White Sands but even this in mind as some of them equal vision is some adarsh nagar and under Suka it is the inner happiness and I just kind of you know because I was just going to mention these things because we're having trouble connecting with Reagan. Maybe I'll just go ahead and read a bit from the from the script for this but really it had to do was like okay we can maybe got run off coming back with you might want to see if she if she's so he's got a good connection but what I wrote that was try this evening for a week right you know we all have our own little Mount Everest that we have to climb really again this self work that we can do through it so let's say you're going to work
 Rite Rug. Are you there
welcome back. There you go you got it you got your regular connection back now yeah I was just saying what I liked about what was his name is Edmund whatever Hillary Edmund Hillary what I like about a statement was we can take that and we can use it ourselves that anything that we have to do in this world which may seem separate from our practice of bhakti can actually become part of our Bucky practice if we see it as whatever it is that we have to conquer in that realm like on the job or whatever we really see this know it's not this job that I'm conquering let's hope we can put this way he says not the amount that you can do it yourself we could say it's not the work of the job that I'm doing but I'm working on myself
 and and so then how does one do that I was going to read this cuz
have a good night but maybe now that I've already talked about I should just go ahead and get into it if you want me to read you a little something that was from this talk that I that I did on Bonnie please this is just about how a normal job could turn into a practice of self-mastery does a tap to wake up in the morning so the endless like cuz there's a lifestyle that goes behind right after you wake up in the morning to get out of bed after you take a shower put on some clean clothes and they sit down in a quiet place to take a few deep breaths maybe say a prayer to God in your heart and you pick up the bug of agita you read a chapter can you don't speed through the text but you can take the verses in you reflect on them you try to let them speak to your soul and strength in your intellect so that when you leave the shelter of your home and You Begin your daily responsibilities you'll see things more clearly
 so then when you set out for your day you got an intention clearly set you got a mission to deepen that
Insight that you gathered in your readings as you go to work you can think I'm not my body I'm not my senses I'm not even the mind that I'm seeing the world through I'm a spark of spirit moving through a material world in a material body I know that according to my actions in the past I'm destined for some pleasure today and some suffering as well
 I witnessed both of them come and go with me even mind things may go well at work today or they may go not so well that's not under my control
 what is under my control is a pathetic if so I'll give it my best effort and I'll be detach from the results whether it's a good day at work or not so good I won't be depressed or laid it either way I'm not interested in the flickering happiness in material game I'm focused on uncovering the steady spiritual happiness is deep within me
 every person that I encounter today I'll try to see them
send the truth that they're all like me a spark of spiritual energy I'll try not to judge them based on their body if their kind of me that would be nice and if their own kind I reflect on the truth that I've also been unkind in the past that alright the unkindness think of their Eternal spiritual nature and return the unkindness with kindness and remember that if I ever act unkind turn it with kindness we could do that in a moment let us hold on okay by choice you can be training your mind to view the world and respond to the world in a different way the more you engage the mind in this kind of wisdom the more than mine picks up on it and begins to respond accordingly it becomes
Ematic second nature
 and when we make it our second nature our lives change the wisdom really goes right to the heart of the conflicts and problems in life they directly counteract the illusion and fear this deeply rooted in most of us deeply rooted for many lifetimes so now the three that I discussing and not just to wrap this up by discuss each one of them in it and how they
 how they transform you and the people around you and it says the Mastery of evenness of mind will Empower you so that even when things are shifting externally in ways it seems problematic You Won't Be Shaken you won't you won't answer into depression frustration and anger conflict in the face of potential conflict with others or others are feeling a sense of vulnerability due to fear change you'll have a cool head and can be voice of reason the master of equal Vision will Empower you said you so that you'll be able to see everyone you meet every living being a sacred regardless of who they are
from for any bodily consideration this Vision will allow you to treat people with a deeper level of respect a deeper level of kindness ultimately deeper level of love people feel this coming from you you gain people's trust and will be empowered to serve as an instrument of Peace where we go
 and the master even our happiness will relieve you of so much unnecessary Endeavor it will be a huge burden off your back you will deeply imbibe that your happiness is not dependent on anything external and that you got everything you need to be happy within yourself when you got when you and and that you've got everything you need to be happy with yourself you're no longer feel that you have to impose your needs on others you'll be free of the fear that you need to change others or the behavior of others in order to be secure and happy you'll be naturally Carefree bring up space in your mind in your heart to care for four others so these three ID
Easter waste Mastermind even if the Mind equal Vision in her happiness this is what it really means to be spiritual to think feel and act spiritual so that's that that's there's a way that no matter what you do in this world are going to matter what your job is it may seem totally disconnected but there are ways that it doesn't become about what you're doing
 but it becomes more about what's happening inside as you do it and so you just have the mound that you conquered its yourself that you conquer
 you must because of her any cuz she poo in the in the stuff he was going through and what he has accomplished through it all the way
 yeah yeah he conquered planetary systems right he conquered the universe he all his enemies he conquered but you never conquered the self it had this card to lust and anger the greed hatred the illusion that such a
yes remember the other day I was talking about Howard Hughes and I gave some little a little camera was reading something and she get this whole great little interesting blurry but Harold Howard Hughes the most financially successful American Business magnates of the 20th century he is listed as having he was in a lot of things right here is an aviation and he was in the movies or kind of fourth richest man in history here a couple of the incidents that show the extent of his well he wants went to live in the penthouse suite of desert in a five-star hotel in Las Vegas after many weeks the manager got fed up and sought to evict him he was purchased the hotel and then stayed on since he was now the proprietor
 I wonder what he did with that guy that shine
he loved watching old movies on television especially at night in those days there was no TV station in Las Vegas airing movies throughout the night so he purchased an existing station and got it to screen movies from the genre of the choice, however despite all his financial success he could not control his thoughts in midlife he developed a phobia of germs and a Mania for secrecy he believed he was free of microbes but they would attack him from the outside the dread of germs became an obsession to protect himself he would repeatedly clean his hands until they bled while serving while serving him his staff has strict instructions to hold all Cutlery in paper napkins after having washed their hands three times
if any of his domestic help the sick you would get scared of excessive germs in the house consequently he would get his entire wardrobe burnt and replaced placed during the last two decades of his life
 he frequently moved between hotels in Las Vegas the Bahamas Nicaragua Canada England and Mexico his Penthouse would be especially primed with black curtains and sealed Windows they consider them to be germ-free zones and Woodwork in isolate it would work in them isolated from harmful germs he believed were outside don't unimaginably wealthy he spent his final days mentally imprisoned by his own heart of contamination and elaborate cleaning rituals intriguingly he neglected his own hygiene and rarely bathe or brushed his teeth
 that's at all at all
yeah we have become Marcos Torres got to become emotional emotional managers to have success in this world would you call it emotion managers this be able to manage on your own emotions
 yeah I don't do well with that I'm working on it me to know, you're pretty good as long way to go a long way to go it all plays out when you sit down to chant that job and you just see how peaceful that mind is you know yeah what is it reaching for what kind of memories is a reaching for what kind of fantasies is it reaching for what kind of distraction is a reaching for because it's not settled
 I'm working on chanting with my breath

 text ever ate there text Tony Brady cashew Pooh who possess all opulence began residing in heaven with its famous Nunda Garden which is enjoyed by the demigods
in fact he resided in the most opulent palaces of Indra the king of heaven so there's this planet that in your lives in was a very famous Botanical Garden there and yeah I'm talking about that now the palace have been directly construction constructed bited this is a trivia for you who is the architect of the demigods Mara pretty good she got it before, she said now here's another trivia question who is the architect of the Demons Mara
 close
 I'm to buy not on Tobacco
 a little trivia
 the palace have been directly constructed
 Leticia, and as beautifully made as if the goddess of Fortune of the entire universe resided there
he's taken everything from injury he's taking his not only his position he's taken his Palace and everything ran out of there right about town
 the steps of this happens a lot
 throughout the world you know Invader know how men take over
 I'm waiting to see anyway I'm waiting to see them two excavation on the Taj Mahal Google up Taj Mahal Shiva Temple there's every every chance of the Taj Mahal was actually is Shiva Temple and not a mausoleum it was replayed it by the Moguls that's the theory
 okay
 the steps of King injures residents were made of coral the floor was bedecked with invaluable emeralds the walls were crystals in the columns are by Doria Stone
wonderful canopies were beautifully decorated the seats were bedecked with rubies in the silk bedding as white as phone was decorated with pearls the ladies of the palace who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most wonderfully beautiful faces walked here and there in the palace there ankle Bells tinkling melodious Lee and saw their own beautiful reflections of the gems the demigods however being very much oppressed had to bow down and to offer a base and seized at the feet of hiranyakashipu you chastise the demigods very severely and for no good reason that's running cashew Pooh lived in that Palace and severely ruled over everyone talked about a colonist
 hi Regis he was a tyrant
 the whole world is just like a history of tyrants kicking in doors taking over other people's homes taking over there taking over there if you know had all the Palaces
jewels of the country
 oh my dear King hiranyakashipu is always drunk on strong smelling Wines & Liquors
 and therefore his Capri eyes were always rolling the last because you was powerfully because he had powerfully executed great austerities in Mystic yoga although he was a bum and all but the three principal demigods Lord Brahma Horseshoe in Lord Vishnu personally worshiped him to please him by bringing him various presentations with their own hands truth that's horrible
 is humiliating
 bomar's yudhistira descending upon do by dint of his personal power running cashew Pooh being situated on the throne of King Angela control the inhabitants of all other planets the two gandharvas this for Basu and tumbler ooh I myself and the big
Dora's up Sarah is in the stage is all offered prayers to him again and again just to glorify him okay you're right so now it is also saying this
 being worshipped by sacrifice is offered with great gifts by those who strictly follow the principles of Barna and ashram Veronica shampoo instead of offering shares of the ablations to the demigods accepted them himself interesting
 interesting why should I offer anything for me on the highest I'm the best yeah you know you know you and I discussed this in the past down
 but just like
 the way the ones trained as a box of Yogi is a vaishnava is really anything that I receive I pass on right and otherwise certain sure there's a certain amount of wealth or certain amount of food or certain you know things that we accept
but generally are ideas that we want to keep our Necessities simple but even things like praise like the devotee doesn't accept them and if they're in if they are praised then with prom with the end they offer that to who they feel it should be off to write to my own Guru to my own teacher to let you know that is passed up the line with your Consciousness means I'm snooping around desperately for validation what do you think of that she like what I'm doing you like when I'm wearing it like my house so I can my car whereas in the way we're trained in devotee culture is when someone says a nice car well you know what I got fortunate for the store nice not nice class you gave oh you like that class where I got it from my teacher have a great team try it is always passing Praise on and it's not for false humility it's it's actually a deep-rooted honesty of I have what I have by the mercy of other people
you know and to not recognize that and then to try to suck some enjoyment out of that
 is actually like poison per ticket and you know that sin in this plays into the whole thing of like you know within the Western yoga world like the Western yoga World in general it's so it it's the majority people that are in it have not been immersed in the culture and never been immersed in the culture and they end and so they when they see the so many groups have so much trouble
 then then rather see it through the ancient texts they see the ancient texts through that and so they sell maybe this whole group thing never worked or doesn't work now or whatever that that you know that that the nature of that relationship but it's just that none of these even the so-called gurus they don't understand and end so when they're giving praise are there
did they do understand that with deep within them at the pass it on it and I remember ramaswamy speaking about the city says that that that
 praise Prestige that one gets in that role if deep if if internally
 they're not deeply with deep humility saying no that is not for me to enjoy its past on then that becomes poison you can you can you get it kills you and I'm sure and so here we see her any possible he's sucking it in he's like he's like whatever you know it's it's almost like you're working in a bank in your in your just taken the money you know when people are making a deposit you're keeping it for yourself it's it's something like that but takes the money and put it right in the bank what night is thinking for second it's mine taking Millions
is every day in the cash given to the bank once they take $0.10 one penny they become a thief so it it it is it in in teaching and that's part of why you're trained to teach is when you're teaching your accepting a credit as your own once you do you realize this is now it's cheating and end it weighs heavy on a person you can often you see it can ruin your spiritual life by accepting praise and so we train ourselves to hand it right back and not be not be snooping around for validation just the opposite give praise to where it belongs everything that we have was by the mercy of others and if it's been gifted to us it's not ours to keep and we're becoming like that bank teller so we're studying we're studying all this stuff and then we're passing it along it's not Irish enough and if you don't like what I'm saying that's okay it's not mine if you like what I'm saying I'm not taking the credit for it I've indemnify myself
from your praise from the students praise and also from the students and not liking it as well I'm sorry that I'm a teacher and I'm here to tea to my job I'm doing my job here yeah it's very good about I found you preserve when you give a class on that you presented as well this is how do you know what I was reading earlier you know about mastering these three different things in this the master of inner happiness right that the the idea being that when you deeply and buy that when you deeply know that you're not searching for happiness to anything extra on that doesn't mean just like you know we're hearing as we've been reading along in this review hearing about the palace in the jewels and you know the power and all that but in one sense this is heavy you know that
 for us we grow up you know watching images of famous people being praised in different ways
hearing stories about it and most of us live relatively ordinary lives and so it sounds
 like to must be the deepest enjoyment in that
 shorting out to be that to be the center of adoration to be the center of Distinction and dumb and in the practice of bought these is not uncommon that as you advance about the you start to receive that and it and it becomes in or let's say about if I say spirituality in general right when people begin to recognize some of the the ornaments that that are displayed by a spiritual person renunciation and knowledge and things like that people are impressed by them and they give praise it end
 and if that aspirin that spiritual aspirin tries to taste that tries to enjoy that it's actually just let it it's it's such a
fire so so powerfully you and that's the that's why I went like like when you and I hear about all of this big famous crew just like you don't had some problem for us is not like it doesn't challenge your favorite actually reconfirms it you know it actually confirms it because you can see you know and and that's not even to like necessarily you know sometimes we see some real
 here in Flagler or just like where you really feel like that person has very is very bad intention to person but it's not even necessarily like that sometimes you know it's people ever that had good intentions but just didn't have the kind of guidance they needed to to pass through the stages you know of of spiritual progress is it's nothing to
 it's nothing just here to take out on the person like all that person
never a sincere it just the opposite in the person falls away due to getting too much praise and too much worship I was looking it up how sad for this person must have this person just couldn't keep it together it's hard to it's hard to get praise and not own a little bit of it it's hard to expecially if an echo chamber of being a guru we're going telling you're the best you're the best you're the best and all the sudden I have to be like give this back to my I got to pass it on I wouldn't want to be able to actually it's you can really screw with your with your whole spiritual existence we try to see yourself as Tiny part of something bigger and all the sudden you have like this Echo chamber of people telling you you're the one you're the one directly feeds the broken ego
 so get ready cause she's bruised broken ego is taking it all in
spiritual being part of God the broken ego is on the center of the universe and their sad I'm looking for satellites to validate me a dice and no not yet that one down there man looking for searching for satellites searching for satellites as in fear of run to catch tapu the planet Earth which consists of seven islands delivered food Grand without being plowed us it resembled cows like the Sarabi of the spiritual world or the, Duke of Heaven
 the Earth yield has sufficient food grains the cows applied abundant milk outer space was beautifully decorated with wonderful phenomenon beautiful entry to figure that one out but if that was confusing whether you retext Seventeen by the flowing of their waves the various oceans of the universes
along with their tributaries the rivers which are compared to their wives supplied various kinds of gems and jewels for her any cash you please use the oceans were the oceans of get ready for this one people if your faith was challenged ever going to be hasn't been challenged will be challenged now these oceans were the oceans of salt water OK Google sugar cane juice what wine would buy butter tread water skiing on that milk yogurt and Sweetwater Sweetwater is what you considered freshwater so at the great lakes or oceans of Sweetwater
 they mentioned a sugarcane juice has the second that I can't I can't explain the sugar cane juice wine I can't understand clarify unless it was just like a Milky
 clarified butter that's key
maybe some milky ocean a Milky Ash it in every night you know I never know I've read I think I mentioned this to you once before or not but I mentioned one some
 this was a commentary by shankaracharya that I read on a bug of agita verse I believe diving into some shangri-la's about the sugarcane juice in other places and other piranhas we read about how the universe has like seven different covering several different layers each one at ten times the previous yeah and you know those are earth water fire air like that you know
 inserting a picture what kind of huge Gobstopper holy and you know it's like there's a huge layer of of like false ego and there's usually but with Shankar what he what he
wrote there if I understood correctly and I think I did is that he said it's like it's something like this it's like if someone puts a drop of poison in your plate of food sure is not that the whole plate is poison
 but you called all the food on the plate poison now I don't touch that that's poison right answer simile is not necessarily that these are huge Gobstopper layers of 100% ego and 100% higher than 100% fighter you know what those elements are invested in those layers just what does this have to do with an ocean of wine was so what I'm saying is Clarity to that reminded me Lily goes to like there's a big ocean and it's nothing but whine
 maybe that is the case but maybe there's maybe there are other explanations for it as well if it's fermented water
plants fall in lot of fruit trees by the water they fall in hole thing ferments I don't know I don't know but I am not a big enough man to say I don't know everything okay
 thank you for being that bigger than you know what I mean I don't know everything imagine living in another part of the world and obviously find the Mansion when you first found the Great Lakes must have
 write the Great Lakes you like oceans imagine first finding how about the first people to find Niagara Falls
