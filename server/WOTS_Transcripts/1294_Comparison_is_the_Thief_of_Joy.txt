 the very pregnant instructions of Sri Prasad little boy provide but before we do water and bleach an AR opening slokas everybody ready
 Ryan nemasket not even satisfied in the Assam in The Shoe Box how much is the very means of Conquest when should offer respectful obeisances unto the person out there got in there I know
 I'm to Nara Nara and Rishi the super most human being on to Mother sarswati the goddess of Learning Center
velocity about the author
 what's the price of a dress shoe with the same to you tomorrow okay nice to get a regular tenants and classes on the bar with Tom and by rendering service to the pure devotee all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service on to the personality of godhead who is praise with transcendental songs has established as an irrevocable fact
 Mariana tomorrow I was born in the darkness of ignorance and my spiritual masters of open my eyes with the torch of knowledge and offer my respectful obeisances unto them
 okay so we're reading today finish Human by the time we're in Canter 7 chapter 7 which is
all about most entitled what's SRI Prasad learned in the womb he heard from from the Great Sage Naruto while he was living in the womb now he's out of the five years out and speaking to his friends in school and sharing with them the teachings of bhakti as a matter fact I didn't you know what I said we could do today. I turned purple just a little bit of review
 a lot he was speaking to them about how do you how did value this human life form its rare it passes by quickly but it's such a special opportunity to achieve the very goal of life and he identified the process for getting there it was in text 29 he said they're different processes of the different process is recommended for disentanglement for material life the one person explained and accepted by the
green purse not too bad it should be considered all perfect that process is the performance of Duties by which he uses his ratty by which love for the Supreme develops so he's identifying bhakti yoga the yoga path that it's from the start is focused on developing love love for God and through God for every living being
 and then he began in the in the in the next few texts he kind of outlines the path for how to practice it and is has a this is one thing I just wanted to kind of dressing change to we bred text 30 and 31 last week let's read them again and then we'll begin with 32 also but in text 30 and 31
 it's a focus
 that kind of like a focus in One Direction and text 32 there's a focus in another direction or how that
the focus has shifted so let's text 1331 we're hearing
 we're hearing it's kind of like a a similar very similar message and being echoed that we here in Bhagavad Gita
 and also that will read in later text like Roberto Swami's about the rest of me to send you so let me just read these two texts one must accept the Bonafide spiritual master and render service unto him with great devotion face
 whatever one has in one's possession should be offered to the spiritual master and in the association of San Lee persons and devotees one should Worship the Lord and then not now search the first I was just focused on the guru is connection to the guru in the group and by focusing on the Bruins focus goes towards the Lord it says an in how one focuses is said here one should Worship the Lord hear the glories of the Lord with face
because I shove them right glorify the transcendental qualities and activities of the Lord because I care to know
 always meditate on the Lord's those feed Collette's Mall in them
 and worship the DD of the Lord strictly according to the injections of the shastra Andrew because that Arch them right in this is actually what we go back a bit this is what God provide in trouble remember when he was speaking to his father to 10 each or a boy
 he was asked the question what did you learn in school today what you know just like parents off and do two children you know what did you learn today in school what was your favorite thing that you learned today in school and then he gave this famous answer and what you out on the 9 practice is about to yoga shoving a denomination of smart and put a saving here he doesn't list all 9 but he kind of kind of hits the camera goes directly to them now he's teaching these These are practices that are
are there different varieties of Yogi's but these are practices that are particularly unique Central to the practice of bhakti yoga hearing what I'm hearing Christmas playlist in Bob and Tom glorifying Krishna in a tournament tomorrow and I'm remembering the Lord's pass time since I'm meditating on them so I'm Arch and um you know the worship of the DVDs are these are Outline by prahlad earlier in the seventh Canto S9 practices for for Focus bring the my bring it into focus on on Garden in these in very direct way
 so that's like that
 that presentations like it likes let's say an outside or reviewing this they say okay so you're trying to bring your mind into focus on God what about this world what about the
pull up this world you know are you to do just go up to a mountain seclude yourself and focus on that how does that how does that
 relate
 to how does your religious belief here in a religious meditation your religious Focus how does that play out in this world any relationships with others or what does your past call upon you to do with not only relation to God with relation to others and so now we hear about that and text 32 and there's a connection here
 that I feel so important and that's it could ask that we read about like later in the 11th cancer when it begins to discuss practicing Bucky and detail
 and it talks about this particular this practice of archana worshipping the deed in the temple the rituals of DD worship
 where describes all of the it describes in some detail how one is method
that ritual
 and then it says that through that ritual through through deep focus of one's attention and meditation on the form of God
 then when one goes down to the world they should see that form in the heart of every living being and we hear a similar connection here when we get to text 32l read it now text 32 reads after describing these different ways this one's meditating focus on God directly text 32-6 next now turning the focus to the world or to the people of this world one should always remember the Supreme personality of got it in his localized representation as the part of mine, who is situated within the core of every living beings heart okay so you're meditating by reading a book or hearing a book from someone speaking about about Krishna
 you're you're meditating by seeing the god scene gods names or glorifying Gods as their.
ride in that these texts you're meditating on God through practices of remembering his Past Times our practices of ritual
 and then in with that you take that and what you gained through that how you purify your thoughts with that then you focus it and you come out into the world and now with every living being you're seeing God in the heart of that living being so one should always remember the Supreme personal about it in his localized representation as a part of mama who situated in the core of every living being so every living entities hard us once you have to respect to every living entity according to that living entities position or manifestation. Just some thoughts on that purple
 thank you for that nice background
 the broadly
we can try to grow spiritually
 we just turned away from the world look at the spiritual to disengage all our emotions from the world
 actions but also the emotions
 Brendon Urie
 that is definitely space on the spiritual part for that
 loud at the same time if you consider the bug with M its focus is not so much of this engaging be engaging with a higher Vision bad it's that
 it's big Bill the reality of this world and there's a reality Beyond this world
so consumed with the reality of this world so that I can connect with some other reality in the Himalayas that is we do spend some time to connect with the higher reality but that Divinity also manifests with in this world
 and that's how they to re-engage with happens
 do in one sentence
 this could be seem to be a sign of spiritual growth that the world that when the world remains real but the divine
becomes more real than the world Arabic reality in the world
 we can perceive it
 from a higher purpose
 this will give us simple examples that say if we are interacting with another person then okay then I don't want to spend time with you we might just have to see if you have a child and baby kicks. OK Google level of reality but the mother is a very
the mother is aware of the how the child is behaving
 yes and the mother will respond appropriately but that does not mean that for that so is that okay is my chili to take care of the check the transmission
 Soledad the way we deal with the world it is odd that okay the child kicked me so I just give the child away but the judge said cuz he wanted what's happening exactly and that production is there like that the re that you give you a kiss would be a response to the world is based on falcon
 the way I act
continue to reinforce my spiritual connection
 the color vision the scene with our seeing them so but maybe better put ours actually absence of Domination by emotion
 emotion alone is not the basis for decision making
 and I'm fired in a cricket match or a referee in a football match
is the Dodge in the sense that the different their fries not biased to any particular site is not in the sense of not caring for what happened to the school Street
 listen to
 acted is happening emotional.
 What's the rules of the game when is the difference between two words
 I'm sorry I let you know that was a disinterested okay
so I'm interested. I don't care for it at all so
 do you want to judge to be interested third party in the proceedings but disinterested in terms of the terms of the outcome in terms of its application by a soda on the side with the world it's interesting that you look for a since you bring up saying
 Sports match right because like depending on where the matches being played and whether the home
team whether a call to in favor of the home team or you know against the home team the crowd immediately we can we can expect at the crowd who are who are not disinterested Observer Bias they want one team to win and and they want the other team to lose they commonly respond to any call that's against their team as this horrible referee they know nothing are they blind and we can expect that it's going to really go that way and if they call the other way than they cheer you know what they had but but they're they're not so interested in seeing truth right like seeing what really happened they are mostly invested and and and they are buying into a a quote on quote reality that matches their bias who are the real truth Seer has to have this dissension just interested platform but but can they have that this interest while
operating in the world and that's what's being called upon here prahlada saying that
 by meditating yoga always has to do with this Focus right yoga has to do with being in the minors bring it into very clear focus on a particular object and here in the previous versus provided to find Krishna bhagavan as the object of focus for the Yogi so you focus on him weather be through hearing or chanting or meditation or ritual bring your mind on to that focus focus it on God and then when you developed that focus when that Focus becomes your find in your Consciousness is becoming to transform in your awareness the God has become is becoming elevated in your weariness then when you come out here while you seen God in the heart of every living being
 and now you can actually move through that world in a sit with that kind of positive disinterest that you're describing right that you're that person is my enemy I don't like them
is my friend there okay you know it no you can even have that
 it's a disinterested in one sense but ultimately manifest in love for every living being right because you're seeing them all and connection it and it is interesting cuz this same Dynamic that we're reading about here
 a place out in the yoga sutras and in a way where where the focus of meditation is not necessarily God right God is saying is one that that's one way where you could focus but really patanjali he's he's he's kind of giving us up on how to describe it a presentation of yoga that's
 that is more, dating for one who may not have faith in a personal God
 as always saying we can still experiment with the mind and we can still purify the Mind by bringing it to focus on one object and
maybe I could just read a little bit from the yoga sutras how I pulled something up
 it's almost like
 Gnostic to were the specific nature of Ultimate Reality and I prefer the word non-personal. So he writes here he's he's writing about you know achieve in the state of somebody and then he says this is Yoga sutras 132 he says practice of fixing the mind on one object should be performed okay April Otteson fix your mind on one object but he was a finding that
is Krishna Patel until you leave me that on Define practice of fixing the mind of one object should be performed in order to eliminate the disturbances of the mind and previous who she said had to find those disturbances as disease idleness doubt carelessness sloth lack of Detachment misapprehension failure to tayna Bass of concentration and instability these other disturbances in the mind so you saying you can free your mind of his disturbances by keeping a focus on one object
 so that's like that's that's the focus that's being defined and then how that plays out in the world comes next then he says it's kind of a famous suit raises by cultivating an attitude of friendship is fourth four ways of relating to people here by cultivating cultivating an attitude of friendship toward those her happy
 compassion to those who are in distress
for those who are virtuous
 an Equanimity to those who are non virtuous Lucidity arises in the mind okay so so
 both similarities here in both these texts from from the stronger yoga Viewpoint and the box of yogaview Punta Cana have a parallel you know there's a similarity there's a difference if we go back to text 32 or says you're seeing God in every living being you know now that you focus your mind on God do these direct practice is a body when you go out into the world and relating with people you seen God in the heart of everyone and then provided us one should offer respect to every living entity according to that living entities position or manifestations
 I'm not sure and I didn't see him, tears I didn't find a lot of time to attend this but that seems to me to indicate that this common Movie 5
calmly cross the spiritual traditions this idea of seeing people at least four different ways of relating to them in these four different ways
 it would could you think so
 it's a month since you could say Lucidity is morris state of exception unclear is emotions we can't see the sun
 Play The Emotions Cloud there's no Clarity how do we remove the clouding of emotions
 that is why is a Converse is not by eliminating emotion so much as by cultivating
 play disposition.
musical Clarity so this is interesting that the way the evolution of thought in the bag with the 6 chapter initially recommends
 to meditate sweat that time initially says one this position to be able to come up with baby she should be equal intelligence eloquent disposition the words the buyers the Empire's the friendly the unfriendly the neutral and mediators one thing he talks about is in the middle of 6.9 when he moves forward
so nobody moves forward from there
 in 6:32 when the person is actually become a year
 bet he says that he says but she's the equality of all living beings in all people that I say she like me and they're equal to me in what in their happiness in their distress which seems a bit strange because the word Yogi does not get happiness and distress in the same things which the only things has gone far beyond that it's more like
 do you get the scent that ultimately
 everyone
 they'll find her
when did a lot of differences between all of us at the level of humanity and the level of similar
 CV all need food specific food we like me very much look at you and say oh you don't like the school you like this for your different for me but I hope we all need food so that
 then that brings a profound sense of empathy is talking about a journey from Equanimity to empathy
 in the initial stage of yoga you have a vision of equanimity so basically you don't get entangled in the Motions of emotions with respectable people behave with us
but they eventually it's more like more of empathy there is concern for everyone
 evolution is that evolve stage I'm concerned for everyone concerned manifest manifest differently based on not how those people are treating me
 what on how those people are and how I can help them like they're like the mother and the child very nice very nice I thought maybe we could have read the commentary to this verse from the yoga sutras this is from Edwin Bryant's translation yoga sutras called The Yoga sutras of patanjali
I am where he reaches out and really draws from the classical commentators so we can read from that here I got to read the the suit Regenesis by cultivating an attitude of friendship towards those her happy
 compassion towards those in distress joy to those who are virtuous and Equanimity toward those who are not virtuous Lucidity rises in the mind commentary since the commentators have pointed out some fundamental differences between Buddhism in yoga when it comes to Consciousness we can do with this suture a similarity the four practices noted in the suture friendship
 compassion joy and Equanimity correspond exactly to the for the rotten of the heart has outlined in various Buddhist suit has rendered in poly as Maita Corona mudita and Omega one must one once more the common context of these practices is underscored indeed the Buddhist
some Utah Nakaya and the some Yuca a g a text in explicit references to the fact that these practices were also cultivated by those who do not follow the teachings of butter so we're hearing how these these ideas before ways of relating to others are there commonly found throughout these
 practices of Eastern spirituality continues in this Sutra patanjali outline to practice essential for enhancing Lucidity the prerequisite for tanning steadiness in in the mine yassa the commentator vyasa pairs the set of attitudes specified by patanjali in the first part of the Sutra sequentially with the conditions listed in the second part as a result of cultivating an attitude of Friendship with those who find themselves in a situation happiness
 one of compassion towards those in distress one of Joy tour the pious Souls
and one of equanimity or indifference toward the Empire's sattva is generated consequentially the Mind becomes Lucid Clarity being the Nature Center what's the mind is clear one pointed concentration or steadiness can be achieved okay so both are looking for that steadiness prahlada same bring the steadiness to Krishna for the ultimate then you'll experience disrupt the end of the following verses are going to go into the specific body related result of that but why we're still here in the in the yoga sutras you can continue to go on to the next commentator much aspartame Mishra elaborates on this
 by being a well-wisher to those who are happy as well as those who are virtuous the contamination of Envy is removed
 this is interesting because actually it's in sit in the next verse
yeah yeah yeah it sucks 33 of that we're about to read next and bobbit a lot continues to buy these activities as mentioned above one is able to cut down the influence of the enemy's name Lila angry delusion Madness and jealousy
 and when does situated walk around her service to Lord Sova Chestatee meet you perhaps being familiar with the teachings of her Lodge you know in the bar with Tom goes directly to this he says by being a well-wisher towards those are happy as well as those who are virtuous
 the contamination of envious removed I can pack by compassion toward those her miserable that is by wishing to remove someone's miseries as if they were one zone one zone Mysteries the contamination of the desire to inflict harm on others is removed
 buy Equanimity toward the imperious the contamination of intolerance is removed
 by those removing these traits of envy
desire to inflict harm and intolerance which are the characteristics of Rajasthan Thomas the saatva natural to the mind can manifest
 in this ensuing loose state of Lucidity the inclination toward controlling the British in other words toward cultivating a focus State of Mind by the practice of yoga spontaneously Rises
 because the inclination for enlightenment is natural to the pure septic mind so so
 and it says it's making a direct connection here as prolonged makes in the next verse that by bringing your mind to God by seeing God within the heart of everyone and and threw that being able to show an appropriate type of respect to every living being according to where they're at
 once lower nature is counteracted what one becomes relieved of our lower nature of the type of
thoughts that are indicative of the lower nature and one becomes purified maybe we could read text 33 now and I hear your thoughts on the whole verse
 Claude says by these activities as mentioned above one is able to cut down the influence of the enemy's name Lee lust and greed illusion Madness and jealousy and when the situated want to render service to the Lord in this way when Shirley attains to the platform of loving service to the Supreme personality is that it
 any thought you'd like to share that is thinking about these things and I'm happy and somebody's work you as long as it's more like
 what does state of the mind is right now and go to state of beer
they sometimes tumultuous people may also be going through unhappiness and sometimes so if you can say that a person is sick
 Allen Payne
 so we going to be like for Quadrant are sick and you're in pain you're sick but not in pain and somebody's healthy but presently be present State the end of the ocean that is more like a steady underlying State chronic pain
 chronic pain yeah okay so it's a it's interesting that this was the first year
happiness and piety or unhappiness in Empire t-shirt place in somebody's in good health they will be pain-free eventually virtuous maid something about happiness the the unvirtuous may enjoy happiness if they go to a place where are some natural calamities occur or if they themselves in the state of Georgia
 if you look at this for emotions does it happen to have compassion to wear those around happiness 8 and 1/2
Nadia love
 friendship it's used here more in the sense of non Investments
 I'll be happier than me
 why should they be happy to know one of the biggest obstacles to happiness is not so much we all can be happy but the problem is we want to be more happy than others ocean media and the mind especially among young people use automated with greater mental health challenges of time you spend on social media and the
the possibility of having mental health issues and Northland the if I want to be happy I have friends I have relationships I have a life but when I was looking at other than I think I know everybody's a bit me and people on social media put the best moments of the light off in the photos that they put the photos are not just physically dr. Also digitally doctored those who were friendship happiness that means there's a sense of your happiness does not take away from my happiness
 you get me up in your place I could be happy in my place cuz everyone has a place in the special lo mein
but everyone was happy and then unhappy this is one of the signs you can see of a stock character is if we fill appeal sings abrea happy actually the commentator hariharananda further in this commentary he speaks to this if we can we continue to read it let me read this in here. I'm just suggest that NV
 generally Rises when we encounter people whom we do not care about I'm sorry Hari Haron under suggested Envy generally arises when we encounter people whom we do not care about experiencing happiness people that we don't care about their experiencing happiness I feel empty right it was someone that I have affection for then I feel happy if I see them happy but it was some of that I don't have affection for an icy they're experiencing happiness
even a Pi's person can invoke our jealousy
 and we take cruel Delight when we find an enemy and misery
 one should rather try to practice projecting the happiness we feel when our friend is happy
 or virtuous onto an enemy who is happy
 and then the mirror that one should rather try to practice projecting the happiness we feel when our friend is happy or virtuous onto an enemy who is happy he continues and the compassion we feel for our friends when they're unhappy should be cultivated for our enemies
 are these practices of equanimity
 the Mind becomes lucid and fixed in the goal of yoga
 so that's that's that's peace to that they said this is the practice of the yogi right to try to recognize those that that lower nature though
weaknesses and not only reject them because they are not virtuous say or like simple or dark but also for the Practical reason
 that as long as they remain that is long as our mind remains clouded by these kind of thoughts
 the Lucidity that we require to meditate or to experience Boxxy you know what remains remained so difficult
 we all have our initial perceptions of others is a strong word but I really like or dislike
 no gossiping about someone else happens when they're two conditions are met
 when we here
we like about someone we don't like someone we don't like
 it starts happening so it's normal.
 Gallup has an air condition to Delight in the joy of his like resent the joy of those we dislike the weather to lie in the long run to us
 do they have social media example disconnect completely but then
Mental Health Solutions Solutions substantially
 Island Silicon Valley last week it's almost all the founders of Silicon Valley are very conscientious that their children will become but they're very aware of of that in relation to what you shared Mikey Kramer here on the chat board of sharing this saying comparison is the thief of joy
 beautifully put a joy and social media has become so it doesn't have to be but it tends to go that way it becomes so much about comparison
that is just like a recipe for our joint for her for a joist slipping away from us the more time that we spend on it we have a question here maybe maybe you could take it from Micah Freeman add should we feel happy when we see a non virtuous person happy and and I think perhaps what he's suggesting there is perhaps their happiness is found in non virtue right perhaps they're the pleasure that they're deriving is through some non virtuous means should we feel happiness for that
 it's interesting that this was today that be indifferent
 if somebody is deceased
 the state of health in Lagos State of work you
no should be at that time
 is this this is not really tall is mrs. Cold cause pain at all it's all so much in the consent of not caring but I think that even if somebody is deceased but not in pain that's not a permanent reality and this is what we don't let it shake our faith and when will it be 2017 Monday and you know this I have to see this person has to do the CDs and I'm doing so many disciplines
you naughty thing the school following this person taking a lot from us we cannot do Saturday in the middle of sticking joints and I'm not kidding for the treatment and is out in p
 that sort of indifferences don't lose faith in the need and the potency of the treatment people that were with him witnessed in a
like he was in Hawaii I think and then he saw people are out in the ocean surfing
 in Prophecy what what is that what do they do when you know what there's a Surfers or fight and he said suck and you call them suffers and if you look at the next turn it seems like all what they seem to be enjoying themselves you know and I and I think there's even a Stoeger property even watched like older men playing golf
 and peed myself look at so nice you know they're spending a nice day out in nature and their you know enjoying themselves and that but even seen that brought profit to tears because he just felt like
 that there at the time in the life where they should be like a sage you know they should have gained so much inside and realization about life and in using all these final moments in the in the deepest way you know it in a state of spiritual Bliss and focus you know in probably seeing that they're kind of still just playing children's games at this age you know
I really should be should be deeply Focus proper response to that it seems like they're enjoying themselves are happy
 probably saw that is suffering and saw that is it and responded with a feeling of deep compassion that you're not even judge judge you know like a judgmental way but just like you know there is a missing out on what's so important you know
 yeah it seems to be enjoying it seems to be much more enjoyable instead. But as long as one is disconnected from spiritual reality
superficie this is not a critique of the survey enjoyment that is disconnected from spirituality is sick and is taking over their skin disease
 not exactly dating one in that each it's kinda running out of time looking for some pain medication and just trying to feel so it's not that the material comfortable place in itself is condemned
 distance from
