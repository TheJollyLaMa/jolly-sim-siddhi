H Jackson Brown jr. which I think he has no relation to Jackson Browne the same okay
 he's a he's a writer is an American author whose best-known for his inspirational book called life's Little Instruction Book
 it makes One Direction's is what he says it's simple and short but I think it's pertinent earn your success based on service to others
 not at the expense of others little light little touch on your success based on service to others to others not at the expense of others
 go
 we have this I'm digesting and ingesting it processing we have this idea
big in the 80s I was getting interviewed yesterday for a couple of podcast and one thing I was talking about is there was a big push in the 80s and it still has left over today to this idea of a potentiality movements that was going on I was in the conversation like you don't live up to your potential you're not doing enough you can do more it whether it's physical or the things you're putting out in this world of your career in the workplace or that's lettuce isamar intelligence or music or art you need to do more and it's different we look at it differently we believe that you should if you do more but you miss the point it makes no difference it makes no difference how far and how fast you driven if you've missed the exit what is the answer what is the point where we said the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing and that's the main thing in the main thing is love of God is the goal of life, is the goal of life
now if in that
 if in that goal or Krishna is the center you could do so many wonderful things whether it's be this wonderful preacher of the Holy Name giving the point of just how many people or you have or your incredible productive career or you're an incredible athlete incredible artist you're doing everything with that goal in mind now if you've missed that goal
 all these other wonderful things you've accomplished will have missed the actual point it's like going very fast in a very fast car and make incredible time going nowhere fast. Tie this into it Jackson Browne over here
 so this is Jenna court again on your success based on service to others not at the expense of others okay
so sometimes we step into a role of State leadership and some of us have a call and we feel like I'm a leader but how am I going to lead people we don't want you just to do your Dharma we don't want you just to do what you're good at you know you got cuz let's face it there's been very powerful leaders you know you got the Mussolini Stalin or Lenin powerful leaders but how did they leave people they let people would cause chaos would cause pain is caused a horrific tragedies so not just step into what you do good with step into your service that's bringing you the love of God and your have this ripple effect everybody else in the universe that you touch is also being touched in a positive way and evolutionary way so when we step into our life like that wherever
he is growing where everybody's feeling served them that is actually our full potential not the converse where I've lived my potential but it's so many people's expenses
 that's how I tried tied it in with what I was talking about yesterday my podcast
 what podcast was at podcast and one was called
 forbidden science podcast is it forbidden pseudoscience is that why it's forbidden
 what is science what is science what is the word science means to know so once you start to say that we know like this is really scientific what do you actually know
 actually I'm trying to find perfect knowledge with imperfect senses so the ID
like we can actually figure it out in this is locked down and this is what the sign says well hey they thought the world was flat a few hundred years ago and then that was a scientific standard and now the only thing well welcome we're just curious and science that people just doesn't fit into the infirmary and information filter and they're certains Sciences there it won't even bother Explorer we're not going to want you speak about God that's Forbidden Science godchild once you talk about God they don't you're just a child you're dogmatic your religious fundamentalist but not everybody is like that I agree let me know cuz I know I was expecting a quick answer
deep thinker are big talker one of the two yes I am yes I am about Jackson Browne Here about earning your success you know
 I think baby alive is just take it for granted that we have to earn our successes but you know you enter Marketplace you know and you think will these competitors there and yeah we're not to fight for it and there's an element of that in our life but you know one really has to kind of be real careful with that because the spiritual part the person that's trying to cultivate these deeper understanding about who I am what this world is supposed to learn what do I have to let go of what am I supposed to understand more deeply you know a lot of that has to do
 and this you're going to find this across the different wisdom Traditions different spiritual Traditions a lot of it has to do with how we relate to others you know if a real callus and how we relate with others going to be
the spiritual understanding you know so you know one Christmas speaking about
 what pleases in the most who pleases them he mentions your people that the move through the world without causing any kind of anxiety or paying for other people you know and that's a challenge in the world because we do have to maintain ourselves you know economically we do have to take care of ourselves you know physically excetera it'll be a challenge but it has to be it has to rise it in in are you know on our list of priorities to to learn to live that way and in a lot of that has to do with what Christian the bug of agita will call this some I caught like a Mastery like it's Matt of what he calls a sukkah this realization
 that might happen to my true happiness is something that's within me it's not derived from anything external you know that the crystal speak about this again and again in the bug of agita
and the idea is that once you kind of Master that way of thinking
 you get relieved of so much unnecessary anxiety unnecessary Endeavor such a huge burden off your back and the more that you deeply involved this idea that your happiness isn't dependent on anything external
 then you kind of get it that you're everything I need is here everything I need is within
 and and I don't have to impose my needs on others
 you know I don't whether it's competing in the marketplace or weather's kind of even like emotionally or in our different ways kind of like imposing our needs being dependent on others for our needs and any become free of that and when you become free of that you'll be actually free you'll like your you create the space that you need free up space in your mind free up space in your heart
to actually think about others being respectful to others care for others in Surf brothers and so that creates a whole new formula right like I need to earn my happiness I need to gain my happiness I'm going to have to well others going to have to suffer in that's there that's going to be there probably were all thrown into this mess together but now you like my success now will be how well I can serve others how much I can contribute you know to the good of others not at the expense right I don't need to take
 Course Jackson Brown jr.
 The little the little lifestyle instruction book how are you doing by the way you look tired I'm tired do I look bad and why did you ask me that question because I care about you
California we're going to California you meme are out Linda and let's not make another announcement that we're done with you now so it's fine I'm just talkin I'm just talkin like friend talk I'm looking forward to that to my Airbnb together then other people think that Lyndon Mariah might be competitive they're not they're like best friend who says that he's trying to stir the pot here or going after each other job. Nobody want that job of the servants look at that you see she's realized it about life if you want the official job of marijuana she's in Africa you are now officially on the hot seat today be prepared we're going to we're going to grill you okay as soon as I said that Henry lit up we're going to be we're going to grill
are you been around a long time to get some answers and remembering supposed to not put people in anxiety right now. See this find out what it's different weed has to be freaking out and anxiety about Krishna is it about two good anxiety that's how we should be an anxiety how can I serve Krishna macaronis said she's as mushrooms are ignorant stroganoff and her dad told her that
 you know what I'm not going to go against your dad he's her dad but his her dad has never been to a Crock-Pot I can barbecue actually he didn't entirely forbid them but he said generally by Travis do not eat mushrooms cuz they're temasek how do you say another language
oh yeah alright let's get into the keep this moving here get them in olive oil and must and sea salt and Justin Gabriel on a grill grill them or grilling missing out there grilling and zucchini what what you got to do what you got to do the gardening broccoli to grill it
 I didn't realize a lot grillmaster like you've got a little apron on fire fire put a grill on top of the file on top of it I saw you the image of parties chapatis on the grill and tactic is it kind of like a an identity that you own when the people are there in like I'm the guy that's working the grill or is it like that so much had to take the captain's chair you're the man of the house there's you know you grill Master would be it would be a natural role that you play although I'm sure Maryland

 rain in the musketeer even wrote them David saraswathi it was before

 who is raised with transcendental songs will be established as a revocable fact okay to Bombay girls have flunked the trivia
Hot Seat the hot seat on Daylight's what are they called Mumba Karis Karis Mumbai car should be able to handle the heat you grew up with this stuff actually I just found this out she might have told me before but shaitani said she was trying you got your sister. It's her. She's looking mirror you want to explain the story here is very interested in your older sister's preaching you for 8 years
 yes and then she would invite me to her house programs and publicly the classes she's an amazing coax I would go to the house to get some Prasad but other than that it yours I did not feel attracted Beyond
beyond the Passat slow development but okay I don't love God but I love pakoras I get that
 and then she
 yeah if anybody has recommendations for New York cheesecake and if that's the door to take please let me know
 I'm back I'm back I'm back okay yeah so she'd introduce me to janry Hardison music like Johnny Hudson's music and I was following her on Instagram and that's been she said in one of his stories about wisdom of the sages that was in the pic of the banda mix by the wake and yeah I started listening to the podcast and that's how I even realize that Pakistan is something that you could consume on a daily basis and it could be fun okay that should be our tagline spiritual topics on how about first
Dennis
 at all. He's like well it's not just a shot or the wisdom of the sages I prayed for her to my prayers are powerful and I'm like no it would be that's why I made her laugh that's why is my philosophy she's got nothing to do with it we made her at the Bowtique every people say that I've heard that
 okay God works through many channels yeah yeah yeah sometimes God takes a person a podcast Podcast Addict or that's the magic 3 okay thank you Mara thanks for clearing that up yeah what she said I'd go to the temple and she couldn't relate anybody
will get a devoted to explain the baggage on to you in like that was that was even off this is all stuff is just too thick and dense she said why she said that she said I'm too stupid to understand it I said that's why Krishna sent me I'm the I'm the Avatar of stupidity has clarified on the criticizing you recognize her. She's still after me because they're in the Moda Center getting hit by a meeting go a little bit for people that have the kids tomorrow I think she's using it in a way to enjoy mushrooms Rocco I'm not chastising you I just encourage you to stop because you are in the motivate lyrics take this and run off without resisting just hear her message from the mouths of babes
 here I take it in
we go head-to-head some time to process it and then do what you wish to do that anyway that's the way Chris decided to Arjuna right and then doing what I wish to do now there's evidence
 back off you can Mushroom band it's all right. I think we should finish this job is to let this let's make some restaurant x29a thing
 I think was 28 this one had the caveat at the end of it that we're looking for
 that's the one I mentioned yesterday that you mention the copy I am the caveat was about a chaste woman it should not be greedy but satisfied in all circumstances very expert handling household Affairs and should be fully conversant with religious principles women like that I really do this the hard
job it's a bring stability hardest job in peace of not being a cold warrior met coal miner or doing Roofing in the July those aren't our jobs are okay nobody said it was the hardest job here okay but I'm just saying it's an important it's an important role in society she should speak to pleasingly and it is a hard job
 okay
 that go on that she should speak pleasingly and truthfully all be very careful and always clean and pure this brings so much auspicious this into the into the household into the world now the ruffled feathers by the caveat is a chaste woman should engage with affection in the service of a husband who is he who is not falling that's the point so all this
stuff is been assuming that you have someone really qualified to serve and if it if that person is not then no no no no no it's not like I'm some slave that's just you know we're not can see everybody's gotta live up to their responsibilities everybody's got to work and selflessly with with caring for one another sincerely that's how it all works store I was just listening to ramaswamy this morning he was telling the story about chitchor K2 and chitra K too because he need Glock did his other queens
 and just favored the one Queen
 they all develop Envy because he was he was not doing what he said he was not being supportive he wasn't playing his role and that creates and be on the way in Italy had a lot of wives it's hard to hold up that kind of responsibility is making that point like a kind of everyone's got a pull their their weight
all right by the way Corona says that is mushy saying that it's mushrooms are in the motivator is not you necessarily okay course I feel better I'm in the motor big difference to them might indicate some degree you trying to text the woman who engages in the service of her husband falling strictly in the footsteps of the goddess of Fortune right cuz she's serving visioning early returns home back to God had with her devoted husband with her devotee husband and lives very happily in the bike on the planets truthfully if if if if everybody's not playing the roles in life that this whole little the whole thing falls apart everybody's got a role to play in the camera
. now of course these are these are generalizations generalizations don't always
 play out there's a reason why there are generalizations insurance for a car that my son why because they made a generalization that boys when they're sixteen or much crazier than girls when they're sixteen that's a generalization and some sometimes they are useful by insurance companies and that they based their whole system of profiling it is profiling what is telling their children to profile profile is there somebody walking behind you say walking fast animal profiles everybody instinctively profile and if they don't they're setting themselves up for danger of course you got
alright alright thank you for the ride
 now let's keep calling that now we've heard about Dharma for men for women for Brahmin has for you is for shooters for viruses now I got to get to the people that are not even in those categories that aren't really following The Vedic
 outline here
 cuz it'll be plenty of those people to and Society what about that yeah the months that's me to call them unnecessarily mud has nothing to do with breeding it is that among the mixed among the mixed classes known as shankara those who are not thieves are known as a hunter or Chandos daughters there's a class of people that hate dogs
 and they also have their hair
Terry Customs everybody's got Customs you know may not be home hang out with my Italian family on Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter they got Customs you know what alligators but they are not here what kind of work were about to hear like in many ways are the reason why the whole Hinduism thing is so confusing is because it's complex is not simplistic and how presenting as it's not the same here is a Dogma everybody accept it or you go to hell forever is, same with pretty simple and it's pretty simple there that Christian was like this is God the Son of God worship them and you're and you're good to go to the good place yeah and it says that it's sort of like simple and easy to understand yes sir this is more like we want to accommodate people on all different levels and we get it that you can't just
square peg into a round hole sure you got you've got to work with them where they're at bring them up on different stages different levels so you know that's it there's a difference between the Western mind in the Eastern mind when it comes to this kind of stuff now we're going to hear how like although Narda to say just came in he speaking to you to steer the king he's laying out all the different categories such as personality types and in speaking to the to the responsibilities and the duties that they should carry out and now he's going to talk about people that don't even fit into those categories and he's going to comment their behaviour which is diametrically opposed
 to where is where this yoga path is going understanding that you can't sometimes things only happen at the right time and you can't force people but they're still weighs a kind of bringing forward to let's hear what he has to say okay I have to jump in here for a second
whenever you ready to go help Martin from The Message Board brought me in my brain a different direction oh I was going to say if some of you were like well I wish it was more simple I was booked he was more simple I wish I wish more than Krishna Aur balram which one is the River today the whole thing can be confusing I can keep it very simple always remember Krista never forget them boom there you go simple you want simple but you gotta understand it's like the face of a clock you want to tell time there's a clock right there it's 4:05 p.m. that doesn't mean behind the face of a clock there's not inserted in her working
is of that clock so we can give you the simple the simple is there if all you want is simple always remember Krishna never forget you see if you see the sun sets in Krishna okay but at the same time you want to know deeper answers we got you covered we can take our clock and because you just use a king and he's got all this responsibility he needs these kind of answers
 yeah you are so he is saying hey a even these
 bands of doggie doors so they've got their customs and we don't necessarily just have to meet Lee tell them abandon your customs and end and change now
 so let's see what he says text 31
 my dear King Brahmin as well conversant in Vedic knowledge have given their vert
that in every age yoga the contact of different sections of people according to the material modes of nature is auspicious both in this life and after death I wonder if that means mushroom eating can actually be auspicious now you're beating it now you're beating this what you mean your beauty rear this it you've teased it out to Fox when you tease your hair chalk em out that totally applies now, they have given their verdict that in every age the conduct of different sections of people according to the material modes of nature is auspicious both in this life and I forgot to follow your duties is going to be auspicious is going to bring about good results let's continue
 one in his profession according to his position in the modes of Nature and gradually getting it one acts in his position on tax in his profession
according to his position in the modes of Nature and gradually gives up these activities he attains the niss, stage the stage where there's no, you begin to act not based on your desire for external things you do you perform your duties without just because it's the right thing to do rather than try to gain something material from it important aspect of yoga real important to have so much about that,
 major King if an agricultural field is cultivated again and again the power of its production decreases maybe they didn't do enough permaculture then and whatever seeds are sown there are lost just as drops of ghee on a fire never extinguished the fire but a flood of Gigi will similarly
indulge unless they similarly simerly drop Savion a fire never extinguished the fire but a lot of games for all the key on it will put the fire out of his keep it feeding it and keep it going but if you apart on again at a One-Shot you looks like a fire out similarly overindulgence in Lusty desires mitigate such desires entirely a little like a social philosophy or whatever would I would say something like completely ridiculous again so I'll be ready principles and we go sometimes OSHA says it's okay because that's his philosophy he's saying the only way to let go of your desires is to totally indulging them but actually
kind of like dropping drops of gion the the fire just keep feeding but but it is addicted to heroin and die everyday this is my understanding what these two verses are saying that they're their share to analogies with us one and it's the ideas that there's some people
 that are not going to step up and enter into the social system in adopt the responsibilities of them they're just from another background and it's kind of be on them and they're not as so refined and they're not ready to live that life to have their own customs and they indulged maybe an alcohol may be in this maybe that you know whatever might be so but he says but but there is a way that they can gradually let go of these things and and so he gives to a now she's when he says if it in it if an agricultural field is cultivated again and again the power of its production decreases in other words
 if you can.
are they rotate crops because different plants
 use different minerals from the soil and if you keep planning the same plant in the same soil year after year it becomes depleted of those minerals
 and so therefore you rotate right then you plan another planet takes on other minerals and so on so the same thing if used again and again and again and again its potency decreases and then he uses the analogy also the key if you drop a little mouse to be on something it just keeps burning but if you if you do it a lot you just might put it out in the same way that we might lose you know someone that has lots of sex my second enough sunlight goes and gets drunk every night I can't do this anymore so it's it's it's saying there's still hope in this way it's not the ideal way definitely the ideal recommend been there done that
feel disgusted with yourself and I'll never do that
 show the net until those desires come up again because what happens by indulging in that it's like it's like blowing in the fire last night I was cooking in the fire so you blow in the fire and the fire goes down and then it goes very high so what happens is they do go away for a moment but that they're triggered come back come back even stronger than ever how's the thorn in the new analogy there Q35 is the last verse of chapter 11 and Narda
 is going to be clouded by this very important often ignored
 date of construction essential instruction if one shows the symptoms of being a barometer chachere Elijah or Sutra as described above even if he has appeared in a different class
he should be accepted according to the symptoms of classification
 okay so that's another is so he saying he sang birth definitely that plays a large role in what we become what we imbibe you know what we get from our parents when we get from our community it's very likely that it shapes us to a large degree but that being said birth is not how we judge whether someone what what what category is someone gets in and what responsibilities he'll take up in life just because someone was born in a family of spiritual leaders doesn't mean that they're going to have the qualities to be a spiritual leader just because someone was born in a family of of laborers doesn't mean they may not develop despite their their family situation doesn't mean that they won't develop the qualities of a great spiritual leader
 and so that must be consider that that that if someone is not living up to their
I can't claim well I'm I was born Brahmin so therefore I am I nothing I'm not going to speak about it in that, if you want to read the commentary
 here it is certainly stated by Nardo Mooney that one should not be accepted as a brahmacharya advise you or suja according to birth
 Bravo this is going on now is that accepted by the shastra okay so he's speaking against how the quote-unquote caste system is playing out currently in India yeah
 are you truly as stated in the Bhagavad Gita
 that's the four divisions of society bro I'm going to touch you have Ayesha and sudra are to be ascertained according to qualities and activities and your behavior and your your qualities and your behavior yeah you got to earn it my father can be a heart surgeon and
just say I got a bad heart bring them in here rocking up are you qualified well my dad's my dad's a heart surgeon just wait a minute I can figure this out it might help that he's a heart surgeon baby give me some tips some innocent Pro tips but I got to figure it out I got to become qualified because I said that I said that to to Sachi Sachi everything about being yoga teacher you know cuz you know she's your daughter yeah she's she's got so much background background and India background and yoga philosophy just from growing up your family and went she's already got a huge head start on anyone else who wants to become a yoga teacher what she say
 sometimes sort of you know that she wasn't she hadn't ruled it out but yeah she wasn't pursuing it
 consideration
 anyway if if one would it would be it would be an advantage for her is an advantage but you don't get it without her and it's not enough
yeah. That's why Americans inherently don't like this concept of a caste system cuz we feel like that's unfair you got to work for it you want something you got to work for it sort of built into the American psyche and if you're born into something that is like less qualified you know my father he was just in a manual laborer but I want to become something better he wanted me to become better than He Is We believe that you can grow into bigger shoes so to speak and the same is said here that if you want to do this bigger things in life you can and if you want to be the head of the social order you just got to give up everything and you got to be an intellectual and intellectual who realizes that stuff isn't worth anything and you have to voluntarily accept the position of poverty then you give me number one
 you could please continue room in that report visions of society
country and sudra are be ascertained according to qualities and activities if one was born in a Brahmin a family and has acquired the qualifications to be accepted as a barometer otherwise you should be considered a Brahmin to bundoo
 similarly a friend of a Brahmin Bloomer involved in it or irony involved in it or someplace, it's literally means your friend of the of a barometer friend of a sepia prominent Allendale how you doing friend of a friend of a Brahmin its so-called
