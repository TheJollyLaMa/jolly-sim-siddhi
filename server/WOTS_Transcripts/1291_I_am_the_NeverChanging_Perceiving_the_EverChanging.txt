and so you know my one of my one of my appreciation of cheat on each other and become the spiritual scientist is his mate has an engineer's mind and a very very refined sharp engineer's mind that applies to the teachings of yoga into the teachings of buck teeth and so it is so helpless sometimes because you know you have a topic is throwing out there that the ideas are sometimes subtle and you're immediately able to categorize them and in the end and come up with analogies and so on that didn't really clarify things in this has been expressed through many books that you've written an article that you've written you have a a daily bug of agita online offering I suppose we could call it which is called is called daily Gita
 yes and so people can search for get to daily to turn it around and find that as well as how many books or under your
I am now 29 now 29 bucks so you have been doing something or someone that we always really love to be on the show so thank you for coming early on the West Coast

 incredible service to humanity and its my fortune to be of some assistance so let's get right into it but let's get into box and it's been awhile since we've spoken about him cuz we've had some days off with Rugrats to travel and we've read about his book and
add some Q&A they said it's been about a week so we we need a little bit of maybe a little bit of a recap of why don't we first channel shloka I'll chant the slow cuz we can get in the back with him and Ryan am the Musketeers on the road tomorrow David satisfied mystery bag with time which is the very means of Conquest what's your first offer is effective base in Tucson to the person out there got in there I not on to Nara Nara and Hari she is super most human being until mother sarswati the goddess of learning and I just really be a sativa you Arthur
 Mustafa Qureshi badri shoe dog about the same to you tomorrow okay I read you learn tenants in class is on the back of a time and by rendering of service to
are devotees all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service into the personality of godhead whose praise with transitional songs has established as an irrevocable
 Mariana tomorrow
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance in my spiritual masters of open my eyes with the torture knowledge I lost my respect a little Basin Sazon to them
 so we're reading today from Trinidad what time
 and it is. Can't 07 chapter 7 versus what what prolonged learned in the womb this is it this is what we've been hearing a lot of little boy but he only about five years old or so
he's been in he's in his class in school this is a this is a class
 bye and four demons you could say who is a class specifically designed to instill indoctrinate our children into deeply materialistic thought he was a sense of antagonism towards the Divine and he can't he doesn't he can't relate to that kind of thought he can relate to thoughts of friends and enemies his mind is always absorbed in devotion and it's tangible
 and it's something that the other kids in the class pick up on and he shared his thoughts with them he shared his thoughts about yoga his thoughts about bhakti and they've responded by saying where did you get this now
we don't hear anything like this from our parents we don't hear anything like this from the teachers in our school it's not coming from here and you you're kind of like the the son of the king you're like a prince they don't even let you out of the house practically so where did you get this and earlier in this chapter described actually when I was in the womb of my mother
 the Great Sage Naruto was gave her instructions in in Buckhannon yoga and it's those instructions that I that I live by now and then those instructions that I want to share with you and that's where I began to speak and this the rest of the chapter this chapter here is it's kind of like a presentation on bhakti yoga from beginning to end it begins with a fundamental kind of teachings about that that any yogurt that was that will be important any yoga path that is kind of begins with the the discernment between
matter and spirit because without that we don't even understand who we are we have to understand that I am spirit I am conscious I'm Eternal I'm in a body that's made of matter that's temporary its incentive I'm moving to a world is governed by certain material laws that's affecting my experience I need to somehow through clearvision disassociate myself
 from my body disassociate myself from my mind disassociate myself from the material realm that I'm moving in understand who I am and understand that it is separate from me and that's the beginning but this conversation in and we're right at the cusp of where this conversation shifts now we're going to begin with text 28 today which is kind of worried wraps up those kind of teaching and began to shift to the teachings of bhakti specifically devotion specifically what a grants and as this goes on it's going to get
the higher and higher stages of bucks in what they look like as a pretty in one sense although it's not so many verses it's a broad-ranging approach to this a broad-ranging presentation to Buck the so you ready to start your temperature when you go to hear some of your thoughts
 yes thank you
 visualize the situation as
 someone living alone surrounded by people who have
 a lot has the opportunity to share what is dear to his heart who is
 he had spoken about what is in his heart the principles that guide us like briefly
is this Mission does to his father is mention them in his class but his Focus here is on is what we can take out the audience and outlining the world
 are you scared of worldview
 how do we how much BB guns that were you with every word he was like an ocean and the same time it's not just want to tell people about the ocean to cross the ocean that is both explanation as well as inspiration or call for action
 both of these are so be
 orange juice
practicing spiritual life is also something which is a consistent and the current industry and why or how one to practice law don't L both of those things are coming over here in the in the previous text of the last text that we read it mention these three states of awareness I'll watch her away from this
 and then at the dreaming State and then the state of Deep Sleep where it seems like one is almost entirely unaware and can you
 maybe you could just share something about leg why is this brought up why is this significant I know that in the different yoga past they speak about these different states
 yes so basically
signing is that this is reflective of the path of the stages in the development of Consciousness that is the soul which is essentially who we are on has two copper rings around it the Saturday morning you can call Simply as the mind-set of the physical body which is the Portugal loveliest the body when the Consciousness comes out from the subtle body grows body and then it comes out to the outer world that is the stage of wakefulness jagruthi been home Linda Consciousness comes out only
 but doesn't come out much to the Broncos boy it is there
suppose we have a flashlight and it is an atom or something on it then if it comes out into the papers the whole light comes out on a flashlight so I bought those LEDs light comes out of the week. If it's like that then the outer layer of blocking the light this is a bad game or something they normally when a person is asleep in their consciousnesses they're flighty at the physical level that's why I didn't they speak in their sleep for
coming from out inside to our perception features that and that is happening in section A till when it is barely there that is the state of dreaming
 and then it is not there at all if he's even the Constitution not coming out of the saddle body
 Ben it is the dreamless state stage so and go between these three
 as a part of our biological function
sleep normally go to where the splitting stay under the Deep Sleep is not exactly the same as what science colors deep sleeper and then there's no rapid eye movement or something like that to renew state of consciousness when even the mind is not active
 so you can consider these three layers to be like this around me that is being reminded magic near me
so it is basically we're going up and down between the three levels of consciousness there is a higher level of Consciousness the spiritual awakening Consciousness which is the ultimate purpose of yoga of Buffy and he is directing the computers are already two different ways is one just completely takes the Consciousness out of the body of the mind and its back on if I have a flashlight are you still around completely and then where the paper covering is that nothing is better than pointing other direction
 so this is a messages in the Himalayas have been getting lost in somebody that eyes are closed and they're lost experiences some other reality the other is
and the Consciousness comes through the mind to the body to the outer world but it doesn't get caught in the outer world in the world in a bowl of service and to send the device is present in this world also compassionate service towards other others
 and guide his friends to come to spiritually awakened Consciousness as long as I can park here he's going to wrap up these teachings of this disturbing discernment between matter and spirit and Isaiah and the way he's expressing you known as he's bringing up these different states of wakefulness or Dreaming or deep sleep
I understand it as I'm also
 it's just like in the bug of agita or says you know observe the changes that your body go through your wants in a child's body and then you you know how to add a young adults body and then you're like a full adult body and then you're an old body and you deal where it is if you were the conscious being within that body have witnessed all these changes so understand that you're not that body that's that the body is a different thing that's changing separately from you and you experience that observe that and simile we can observe that are our mind goes through different states of awareness from Wakefield state to the dreaming State and then even in this deep sleep which is one says we don't really directly observe but we kind of come out of it and feel that oh I was there like I was I was in deep sleep you know when week when we come out and we realize that we were in some
real estate and that we kind of them experience of witnesses witness these different stages even somewhat mysterious and there be a bit beyond our control you know where I first woke up this morning I was dreaming one of these weird dreams where I like I had to get some kind of train ticket or something like that I had to go somewhere and I was spending all this time just thinking about it and preparing myself for it and you know I got to the train station to purchase the ticket and there's some issue all know this isn't where you get that ticket you get it somewhere else and I'm just kind of going through like all this experience and then you wake up and you realize all of these thoughts that were in my head there they just proof they're all gone forever now like it like that experience that I was so deeply immersed in just a moment ago
 it's gone and it was just some very temporary
mental
 configuration of some sort that came together for a moment I had to experience it and then it disappeared forever becoming like meaningless like eternally from that point on but I'm kind of going through the stages and I'm going through cycles of them again and again again I'm awake I'm dreaming of a deep sleep I'm awake I'm dreaming of a deep sleep and we and we are that something that's that's steady something that's like of a different nature than that constantly shifting and peladas it is turning to the to the other kids in the class and saying recognize that understand that your separate from it all and then what to do about that and he's about to get to that point with this person is going to kind of wrap it up and let me read text when he says therefore my dear friends are sons of the Demons
 your duty is to take to Krishna consciousness
which can burn the seed of fruit of activities artificially created by the modes of material nature
 and stop the flow of the intelligence and wakefulness dreaming and deep sleep you know you can break out of this cycle you don't have to be trapped going through the cycles anymore in other words when one takes to Krishna Consciousness their ignorance is immediately dissipated some thoughts on that yes it's a slow night the more we become an observer the more we can understand that I'm different from all this
 and
 the fundamental distinction between the changing and the changeless that is something which is foundational for spiritual growth
 because
well change itself is unavoidable in life
 what it is that
 we need to have some anchor we need to be anchored in something beyond that change so many ways the the search for spirituality begins when somebody's looking for bat unchanging and he saying that yes which wheels are coming some bills are smaller and they can be managed and I'm understanding of changing a spiritualist a tanker
 you know it is interesting to think about dreams you know because
 in a sense we passed through life in the waking state
with the illusion I suppose you could say
 that I'm in control
 that if I'm in a circle and Circumstance I could change that circumstance and I can kind of guide
 or determine the experience that I'm happy now course we can't really do that otherwise if we could if we really had the power to do that we wouldn't be experiencing so many of the unpleasant things that we are forced to experience in this world but but we do feel like oh I can shift the second adjusted when we enter into that dream state
 it's kind of like we enter into these these this world of experience where we feel very helpless
 sometimes when we go to sleep you do some people unfortunately know they have, Lee they have bad dreams
 and you may even be afraid to go to sleep you know because now I'm totally vulnerable
now it's just like I'm rolling the dice now anything can happen to me in the world that I'm about to go in and I don't even know that I'm in a dream state when I'm in it I'm just having to experience some bizarre world commonly frustrating World sometimes a terrifying world and there's nothing I can do about it and and so we're kind of in that world even when we're on our way. 8:00 Works we're kind of bound by past activities past, that way we don't even know even how far back was is busted in this life was it in a previous life that's determined future experience that I meant to go through
 and I'm stuck in this cycle and I've been stuck in it for a very long time how do I break free they're all these different practices of yoga that one can the 12 gauge in kind of break
what is this tree right to try to to try to get into a realm where I'm no longer subjected to these experiences that are beyond my control and so he's going to he's going to speak about this and end in the next attack Siri text 29 this is where it shifts right now he's he's moving out of the instructions that had to do with hey take a look at the world take a look at take a look at your body take a look at your mind realize how they're all constantly shifting and you're the steady Observer all of all of that and now he's going to move into like how to break free and he's going to speak of yoga but he's not going to he's going to speak specifically about bhakti yoga
 I so let's let's read text 29 East of the different processes it and you know I want to I want to draw attention to something here it won't let me read it first of the different process is recommended for disentanglement from Material life right if you want to become free
Living in a Dream world even in your waking state if you want to be free from being subjected to random experiences that is that go up and down or are maybe pleasurable one more importance and you're stuck in the world of suffering and their different process is recommended for becoming disentangled from that
 the one person explained and accepted by the Supreme personality guided should be considered all perfect sews in one of these is coming directly from
 Lord Krishna are coming directly from Vishnu this is that process is the performance of Duties by which love for the Supreme Lord develops
 okay this is this is this is the acid Eva did the author of all the Vedic literature you know
in his in his most important inconclusive work that you made by the time he's given so many structures and so many different types of yoga but in this Bob time again and again and again so that we don't miss the point he's he's coming out and he's saying look here's prolonged he's considered one of the Maha Jenna's he's considered one of the great personalities one of the great examples one of the great great teacher like the topmost
 and here he's saying that yesterday different paths that can help disentangle entangle you but which one is the best which one is all perfect which one delivers the most is kind of the question from the very beginning of the bog with Tom when we were back with the sages and I'm sure I knew where it where all the sages they were all learned it in velocity of his writings and all the teachings of yoga but they're trying to go you know is it is it that
 is many doors
into this one mansion and they're all equally the same
 and they were in one sense they were operating under that assumption but they weren't finding satisfactory results and so they turned a suit to go swimming and then he gave the answer hose bhakti that provide is giving us a Mac answer it's is that process bye bye bye going to perform your duties through which that through which you develop a love for the Supreme
 that's the one that's considered all important in and there's a war here for you I wanted to speak to you about it it says rathi
 it says that it is that by which one I'm just I'm just saw ready but we're one quickly develops writing this word r a t
 are the Sanskrit word ratchet it's the way that is commonly used
 seems almost on yogic right
attachment attraction it is commonly used really even for like
 like intimate or even sexual attraction or sexual enjoyment you know or I think the way that is especially meant here is like loving attraction right it's that that that that yoga path through which one develops loving attraction that's the one that's that's the one that's the best that someone is considered perfect
 yes
 listening about when you get out of this world are we going to the Consciousness Stones away in some of this Detachment that okay this is temporary this is detective this is a loser and I don't want to be a part of it and
Detachment is not desirable but indispensable all the changing is what is distracting us from the unchanging but then the other ways that while there are changes that is done changing which underlies the changing
 so we become entangled not so much because
 we are experiencing the world and changes within the world experiences that you're forgetting the Lord who is the source of the experiences
 I find it completely horrified as they watching it
there's somebody that the movie is being directed by someone
 and that is a person who is the
 and they're watching the movie so while they're at what level experience in whatever happened to the experience has been charged and okay where are you taking the store
experience in the movie assembly from the movie making team experiences a movie they can experience it from dorian's perspective more detached perspective bright so this went wrong just went right to the Lord is there then we're going to close my eyes I don't want to see the movie
 and that's because he's not on how well I can close my eyes cover my ears and directors expertise you know that's interesting that you use this example I think you could also even extend it to Ben say or
viewed from the role of the actor in the film
 right cuz the the actor in one sense is right in the middle of all the changes on this crying the actors the one that's smiling but the actress also where the director and aware of the nature of the film itself
 and so and so I'll do that but they know they have a role to play
 and they know that they have wrote that I remember one of them one time we brought you out and we had a really great conversation about functional and fundamental identities that that that we all have a fundamental identity that is eternally I'm Christmas loving service and that manifest and some unique special way but we take on these
 we we take on these functional identity such a temporary dharma's temporary rolls
and in a sense as an actor adopts temporarily adoption identity to play a certain role in a sense we also do that in life right currently I am a mother currently I'm a father and I'm going to play that role right now and it would have played well
 you know I I maybe the business person or I may have this job or this duty to perform let me act in this play Let me let me play this role in this film of life
 observing it all experiencing at all but in one sense like you're saying like an actor knows that this is just a roll and in this is you know I Addison Point I'm going to step away from playing this role and I'll be me again
 that in a sense that's what we're doing in this world to you know where we're moving through it we're playing different roles but we know that Beyond this there's the real us
and that us is that that did that knowing who that me or that us has you know who we are
 that would cause someone to Ghana right this very fundamental knowledge of myself my identity and end in our bucket glass we understand that identity isn't is eternally linked
 22 God eternally linked to the root of all our existence just as a leaf is eternally linked to the plant in the route that the nurse is it illegal to say we have these two roles as an actor and as observing
 bad cops will be coming out of this play
remember exactly when the word play is used is not to trivialize what is going on it is serious serious consequences there is more to contextualize not trivialize yoga in general when can we know that we are growing in back to God becomes a bigger reality
 so every day when we are doing
 navigate to the presence of divinity
TV on this reality and I'm going through everyday and experiential
 conformational recollection when we Face life's ups and downs it's beautiful. You know with this is going to very cool we're going to here in the in the next few verses
 the method of practicing this yoga he's identified bhakti yoga as good as the the most perfect which even that's a topic is itself cuz that could be easily misinterpreted as a sectarian kind of consideration
 and he's going to he's going to identify boxing he's going to he's going to talk about how it's practiced
 and then he's going to begin to speak about the results of it on two different levels in 1 verse he's going to speak about it
kind of like a more General understanding or let's say the initial results of this practice and then he's going to have quite a few verses that going to the d The Very Advanced stages of the you know that the results in the very band stages of practicing boxing
 but the initial results that you begin to see God everywhere that you begin to see God in everyone in other words that you have this constant awareness of God just as a as a
 as a actor has even though they're in their drama they're very aware of the director
 they can be aware of the unit of the director alone we can be moving through this were playing a role
 and at every moment be aware of the director behind it
 and you know it's even just yesterday for was thinking that
when we hear descriptions of say like Ashtanga Yoga
 which is a method of yoga where in the goal is to develop one's powers of concentration
 if you know there's there's if you get you know this there's eight limbs to the practice for stronger yoga that begin with yummy yummy you're different lifestyle choices that will be helpful in settling the mind and then there's Asana so that physically that your body ceases to be like fighting against you and said only the mind and you get all of the you get all of the
 the channels in the body all the systems in the body flowing very smoothly right the digestive system and the circulatory system the the skeletal system the muscular sissy get it all kind of moving smoothly and that's helpful for the mind to become more Lucid in and settled and then is pranayama that through breathing there's a connection between the
breathing in the mind in through patterns of breath walking begin to settle that mine still more and then put your heart one begins to withdraw the senses which are always when they're going out into the changing world it's hard to keep the mindset of the one you withdrawal and then the mind starts to become more settled and then from that point on
 there different levels of concentration and the way that the strongest yoga is one way that they measures this is really in length of time that you can remain concentrated right there's dharna where what when practice is focusing the mind of one object and it said that once achieved the goal that Darna
 when you can hold them mind steadily on one object completely steadily and watch object for just 13 seconds if you know how that mind there I wants but even just for 13 seconds you've mastered this advanced level
love yoga you know and then when you can hold it there longer you can enter into a state of consciousness I'm called Tiana we just sometimes translate is meditation but it isn't very deep form of a focus of very deep form of concentration wearing mysterious things
 I reveal to you things that normal people just can't pick up because of your concentrated focus on a particular object mysterious things about that object to reveal to you and then ultimately 11 can for her for long periods of time to come in 10 that they can extend it still longer
 and through to expanding the length of time looking into this deeper stage called somebody wearing one begins to experience something of their own true nature and all of the mental a programming within our mind
 is it sometimes I say it's like to centigrade
or perhaps we could say that if he comes in a sense almost meaningless to us we see it for what it is and we cease to be controlled by it but I was thinking about this idea that dumb
 expanding the length of the. Of focus or expanding the length of the purity of our awareness this is fundamental and you know what has a stronger yoga is laid out in our body practice although we're not necessarily trying to enter into a State of Trance
 we're in as you were saying the focus all goes in Word
 we may be practicing it by bridge by the Consciousness being focused outward into this world through service but hot but but the foot but how deep is that Focus cement is that connection is that awareness of who I am in relation to the director to Shri Krishna behind
do I see Christian the heart of every living being that I'm talking to and or can I can I be in that state of awareness
 not just momentarily how can I extend the amount of time in a in a course of an hour in the course of a day in the course of run round of Channing job you know like when I chant japa can I chant can I sit down and over the course of say 7 minutes or so can my awareness be fully focused on hearing that name
 I had a very difficult I'm still doing that you know but I feel encouraged when the length of time within that rounds extends like you know if we were too if we were to say you know what only in that seven minutes that that consumers Channel around his mind was was absorbed in hearing that vibration and not distracted to some external
stimulus what do was Focus for let's say out of those 108 mantras it was focused on 11 of them but if it is but if if if through practice into prayer and through Mercy you know it becomes 22 of those of those Montrose now we're moving in the right direction and eventually could become you know hundred and 8th and it's as I pass through life you know rather than occasional having thoughts
 we're on perceiving I'm God everywhere
 where I'm where I'm aware that God is in my heart right now
 Emma where God is in the heart of the person that I'm speaking to you right now that if I can expand the length of time
 the percentage of time
in my hour in my day in my life that I have that awareness then I'm moving towards this deep yoga States you know this beautiful day feel like State and so the method of how to do that is going to be described in this next verse it's a big you know there's so much to discuss and maybe I'll read it now and we can begin to discuss but maybe come back to it tomorrow cuz our time is running out of charge would like to hear this standpoint if I don't sell one principle which I found very helpful is
 it's not that we stopped pursuing external pics and ideas what we pursue externally is in harmony with what we value internally
externally
 is in harmony with
 what we value internally that is there then I would expel Pursuit woodpeckers away from God they would take us away from reality so I am seeking money but what am I sitting here bored I am seeking your particular position a particular relationship what am I seeking it it is so that I can be better spiritually anchored so that I can connect with this person service person so that I can buy my own spirituality
 focus and balance of opposites
but the focus and balance both can come when they suspect what we value
 is consistent it just like when you're riding a bicycle you we are moving
 yes you focused in in but you're focused and moving in One Direction and the more than your focus actually the more balanced know that's that's really helpful in other words are sumati you know somebody has to do with the friend of mine from is fluctuating from from one point to another point back in back and forth in one sin and as you began it one way to do that is to withdraw from everything external
 but another way to do that is to keep moving in the same direction even though your your Consciousness is is moving towards the external but is always moving in One Direction and probably say that's called Krishna conscious
you're bringing this up remind me this is a verse that I think about a lot from Bhagavad Gita is after the verse that mentions that whatever one is meditating on what everyone is thinking of at the time of death that determines their destination in the next life and Christian insist I was not there for HazMat survey shoe color shoe all of the time Mom on who's smarter
 always think of me
 and and anybody doesn't say by sitting in a lonely place in shutting down your senses and going within he says my mom is smart you would you try always meditate on me always remember me up in this war even honest Marta is a very yoga term you know if Mom on a smart a huge which I always think of me and at the same time engaging us to do you have is a warrior engagement fighting Arjuna and so did the translations therefore Arjuna you should always think of me in the form of Krishna
same time. You're prescribed duty of fighting with your activities dedicated to me in your mind intelligence fixed on me you will take me without a doubt it probably gives a very short but very potent commentary maybe we can hang with this commentary he says the instruction to our June is very important for all people engaged in material activities right we all have this dream this drama this film that were moving through in this world most of us don't just walk out of the most of us have to engage in it
 isn't the Lord is not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements one can continue them and at the same time think of Krishna how and he gives his clue by chanting Hari Krishna this will free one from Material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in Krishna by chanting Christians names want to be transferred to the Supreme planet
colloca without a doubt it was so simple it's a symbol of this month that has the power to keep the mind moving right you can take your engagement in this world do it for Krishna is arjuna's asked to do his engagement for for Krishna
 and engage in the chanting the name and will be it's like riding a bicycle cycle paddling it fast enough so that the balance becomes easy and we move rapidly towards the destination that would they were aiming for
 yeah please go straight ahead to turn left and right
