 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages of daily or the podcast with your house dropping off and co-host in senior educator the Barclays Center in New York his stupid ass welcome to show everybody welcome and I think I'm in back from a week of travel and Coast uba has been taken over the reins of the ship for a whole week have a Coke Stevia was it just a week was it longer when it says it was a long shot I can't remember cuz you know damn well you know it wasn't the same without you bro. That's what I say it was we we brought us some wonderful guests but it just wasn't
that incredible journey was like boom boom boom boom like the old days just like every night you wake up in a different place last two nights you had this incredible ones with iboc tsf what you want to be Harrison we did two gigs they're hung out with Ken Putnams he's cool now I was wonderful that will San Francisco seen is like you never showed up shamasundara showed up at our at the program and you rubbing all sweet message original devotee
 when did I make my days are so peculiar one day I did the Revelation records parking lot picnic where we did a book signing then I went right to Neil Shaw's
 a father's funeral that's who I'm so happy you were able to attend that I was one of our everyday listeners for years and years
and he's got you know he's an Indian guy that grew up in Huntington Beach it was not really that connected to the spiritual path and then he heard John A B C D and John he was interviewed on our show in American guys are interviewing her and they just got hooked into the podcast on a regular basis
 oh yeah and then that happened. Then that night I did a whole Harper show I went from a funeral to a hardcore show
 Indian funeral just for like you you know you do you say prayers and you just get together with families like days of grievance and then they made a bunch of grape Gujarati food nice to they have those little that little kind of that leaf that's rolled up with the filling inside the cutting a little like coin kind of things that a lot of dhokla to they had took over that other one that I become a duck life and what's that one will you make it with chickpea flour than you roll it
name for a little chunks on it
 set a reminder now that's a good one that I hung out with all the book publisher crew at Monday they were great. They were happy
 that it has been well-received convey thank you don't get comfy and then if she live south of San Francisco brought me Jello jelly jelly gifts Magellan for me so I think she meant just take them and then the last program is at the Castro has a room that was a big beautiful home in Den in San Francisco has a little concerned when I heard that you were doing okay
read Raghu tell the truth what's going on in there a shout out to who me who has this beautiful Studio setup a big your time program down there to me and then in San Diego at the Krishna house and we'll just meet all these others I get it again and I'm not a new Prius set that one up in San Diego could assure who's never misses an episode in San Diego we drove me around the whole week and you go look at Shore and his nice wife brunch Monday I never miss shows also they just drove around and filmed the whole thing we would take care of it sounds like it was
 despite all the traveling and stuff like that is quite wonderful and got to meet so many people to distribute distribute distribute books sell books and was great it was great time I want to read a Christian maracle I got from RMR yesterday
our marks our longtime listener from before the show is a show
 he said he said
 he said he has a Christian girlfriend and he said my Christian girlfriend found this house I'm renting in Leesburg starting last month it's about an hour from everything it's best known for Bassmasters fishing tournaments my landlord was over today about a plumbing issue now I met her before and she knew I was much older she and I knew she was summer is a is a lady issue the landlord of the landlord so I met her before I knew she was a much older Indian bodied lady but I don't go around asking anyone their religion but she was almost in tears she said I'm so happy to see Lord Krishna in the window and showed her my Altar and she pointed out to probably pot on my Altar and she hugged me and like any
Indian mythology she said she's already welcomed she's already welcoming me in welcoming me into her family and already started inviting me to India and bring Dobbin and and and just got her and her sister family and her sisters family is going to be some good food coming out of this to decide that's my motherly devotee as my landlord only a year removed from my first rental place Krishna arranged in Florida living next to get hit by the hurricane yeah and that seemed like a disaster but now to see how it moved you know just see the way things work, is leading all of us that's when we just had that face you have to have at least you know if I'm holding on to something very tightly I can't pick something else up so sometimes we have to let go of things were like I got to let go of his wife Kristen don't take this away and then
drop sort of like a stone it might be an attractive Stone to pick up a giant giant Diamond has got plans for us and we just got to trust a Christian that does have a plan it sometimes that plan is you know what wait wait and percolate a patient's realize that you're not in control
 write realize that we can't control the exit we can only do so much be patient see how you can process it you know a lot comes in the waiting process and the growth can happen there I ya ya in that in that waiting process you just get to think about stuff and you get to test your own boundaries of your mind cuz you're my start to complain your mind will start to blame your smile start to go to other people that's where you really got to apply the spiritual principles weight be tolerant take shelter
Krishna interesting out of this this is the waiting process is fertile time for happy things to grow but you can't put diversions in the waiting process you can put drugs or alcohol or Affairs or the you know you can't get the Mind distracted it's just got to eat on a weight with Krishna put Krishna in that waiting process and then so many beautiful things will Sprout from that Garden it's interesting you know what it's made me say I wish I knew more about Indian music and rockers and all of that
 we're going to come back and take birth
 but when I think of like western music in a calmly builds up to attention
 and then there's a resolution like boom right like I'm sick of it all
and then again I don't know so much about raugust but it seems like it's a different thing you know it's like you you spend some time in the space you know and I couldn't and I think you know we have this tension in our life and we have some faith in we're hoping that like born straight out of the tension is like the transformation that we
 Aspire for but actually write it taste like there's a tension and then there was a period of patients that there that you know where where there's is processing takes place in a suit that processing that
 that the growth takes place and then there's a resolution that comes down to Rocco's and and and then you look back at the whole thing and you understand the tension that took place like a long time ago like that was meant for the growth that I went through you sure and when you look back on that and that waiting. And it's all like this
weird little test like did you apply it how did you apply the stuff I don't man I went through it but I didn't apply it would have to go through it again yeah I just sat there and anxiety constantly person that spends about Italy or Italy trip is going to Italy people if you want to get away with this summer join us go to wisma stages.com events and we have a really great annual Italy pilgrimage great for family in East l.a. coming at 7:37 and there's the chief he's coming my kids are all coming
 Karina and wouldn't it almost wouldn't be the same now without Lori and the chief you know they're like no that's their annual sort of their spiritual anniversary
you know it's good that it's because it's good if you have a person a partner suppose that that you sort of a lot to get into Krishna conscious or are you preaching stop preaching me please and you bring them to enter and less than and it really has this the beauty of Italy I call it an easy in-and-out instead of saying hey let's go to India you say let's go to Italy sounds a lot less overwhelming more eat and let's pray yeah but it's it's peppered with pray and there's a little in there so that's it that's a good one a lot of loving you and it was coming with me in India to the Indian documentary this year so we got the double trouble and Mara will be there to get the whole team there for India that I was just realizing it has been so long since I've been to
it's going to be good Prabhu last time we are there we are totally dope enough for a cryfest I think the last time I was there was like
 it was over 20 years ago

 backyard cover group meetings today at
noon and 1:30
 already
 here's the Nugget for today I hear you already sent from the nuggets from Amy Amy Amy Poehler
 I know she is I don't I don't know who she is she comedian yeah she's like a Saturday Night Live person
 okay you know what you're at country western guy anyway we do
 oh you got a squirrel like that at least
okay here's another I want to be around people that do things I don't want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do I want to be around people that dream its support and do things thank you so much it's like
 I think and I guess this happens but whenever you're like a do or in this world there's always someone trying to undo your doing they're trying to like take that envious such a real thing in the material world when you're creating or step it out of going out on a limb or just creating something in this world you get off you get a lot of accolades and that's a nice thing Hayden graduations and then you always get the person you like that's staying so they're trying to undermine what year were undermined anything and it's it's the envy that they had that they have and I feel like people that are due
things in the world they don't have time for that they're just they're trying to like just create stuff and it's you know I'm feeling that as well too right now cuz the book just came out and I got a lot of appreciation which is it's already
 you're always going to find it that exists whenever you do anything in this world that we know that are great people doing great things they're always going to be people trying to take a nap and if they can't take them down legitimately they'll fabricate something about them and you remember that we put on our first shelter record and it's sort of got a little big. Our first one but the one that got bigger we are all monks but like we were good boys we were staying in that we were good boys in line putting out
creating music
 and when they couldn't find any dirt on us they just made up there he had these guys you know they're just trying to get people into Krishna but really they themselves have got like these video games in the basement of the temple they're doing all this crazy stuff that wasn't true anyway you know what I said when I saw this certain what I thought
 what do you think what's that more than ever due to the internet and social media
 people have become critics in other words like if you go back to when we were growing up right like you would have like rock bands and then you'd have Rock critics right and you know sometimes you know rock critics have a lot to share and they can help you have deeper insights into the music and so on but I never liked them but the fact is that so much
is really useless just criticism you know just someone tearing someone else down pointing out all the faults and someone and I think back then it was almost just like it was almost I commonly felt that
 I'm not trying to put anyone down that does that but it does a little bit of like I don't know shame in that game you know psych
 you can't be musician so you become a Critic and then you just become this person that just has like a lot of negative stuff to say that just to get your sell your magazine you have to say some nasty stuff about someone and then people you know what I'm saying it was like yeah what is it sells gossip sells exactly and it was a little bit in Noble like I'm not saying all Rockets but there's a certain type of something on Virtual unvirtuous about the role of being a Critic it's like you were above the musician will just you hadn't earned it
and work in your mouth and write your own music yeah yeah I got some better music music music malefic Planet hovering around me like a malefic moon it and it and let us be clear that there would be like critics that would like really qualified journalists you know that that really learn to ride and really had deep inside and had something valuable to share but because of the because you were saying that because of this song because they gossip cells are Oriental dirt cells or or just negativity cells because it reaches out to that lower nature in the human being and they have a hard time resisting responding to it you know probably more these critics were producing - kind of stuff then really truly insightful stuff and it becomes seen as a little bit of noble what what the internet did and what and then
comedian just like really did it wasn't made everyone could become the journalist and everyone could become the critic without any qualification it's horrible everybody's a Critic and everybody's got negative stuff to share and and and it just creates a whirlwind of and in what happens now is we have to criticize people who criticized the critics like in rather than anybody actually doing something we're all just criticizing each other's critiques what a horrible swarm of beings and therefore what I like what you say is I like to be around people to do things even if it's a little thing
 even if it's a small thing just do something plant a seed in the ground you know how it has like do this yeah you know I don't I don't want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do write you something yourself don't just be a Critic
do something you know it's a little thing even in it and in what will you'll find is that it makes your life so much more real and so much like more it it's like it so much more RAM
 nurturing is at the what I'm looking for it is it's like it's a healing just to like turn off first world one of the nurse yeah it's it's it's edifying you know and if you had to do something positive in the world no matter how big or small
 you don't have to feel your time up with that yeah unless your BS this is for me at U2 wrote on the message board it's the perfect storm for learning how to be equipoise because it's it's like right now because my books just came out you can have like a whole bunch of like positive comments on your Instagram and he get one guy or like you said you stinky fake girl and it's just like that one
I think you just like to really awesome reading the reviews the Amazon almost be above the praise as well as another bubble of like now you know I am going to do a Leti world that you have to be like I just did my duty I'm just creating for the sake of creating and when you get into the praise that you're more sensitive to the the people trying to take you down she got to sort of just sort of be above it and because when the when the criticism comes it really throws the ego off as well and it is within the realm of bhakti practice if he comes so important you know like this is devoted to that you know what is neophyte devotees we get caught up in cycle so just going online finding out what other people are saying about bhakti criticizing it feeling like they're Superior to them they criticize back you just getting these Cycles why not just do some
am I missing practice looks like this back and forth like like I'm going to change their mind right now and then go back and forth and then the political ones so how does it work yeah but it just draws your mind to that lower-level kind words your mind could be so purified sonor so edified by even in a small sweet just doing your own practice just getting really into you on practice just just picking up one of these books and reading it in becoming deeply absorbed and thinking about it speaking to a friend about a sharing your thoughts back and forth about it you know that's something you're doing something up you know what I do that everyday but now you really doing something you know it's just like whatever it is it might be small just leave the party and I'm not saying that there's no part you know there's no preview for constructive criticism that certainly there are all caught up in just whirlwinds of just constant criticism and not doing anything here
 do something
are they a rock products do it given construct constructive criticism sometimes Rock critic sat there they have great insight into the music they might really know things that we don't know notice things we don't know how old is Strachan actions were not dry like that's that's what you know maybe but this is nothing compared to their last album by saying you had a baby you're like it won't you had a baby but the last baby was much cuter than this baby every every like record you put out their heart and soul into it or heart and soul into it
 you know I saw I saw there's one really famous athlete any retired and then people expecting all that guy's and it's just natural that he'll go into the unit become an announcer whatever you know
 you know how to use these athletes, DB, oh yeah, taters
and you said I don't want to do that because I know what it's like to be an athlete and just having these guys judge what you do and talk to me cuz I don't want to take that wrong I think the problem with you coming to coaches they got to I got to travel just as much as that athletes to go there's no retirement only like some of them become coach has 35 the retiring at 36 yeah but your whole life has been on the road you too welcome to my world all right will you chant mantras and we'll get you there okay
 Mary disappeared while she's gone she's not even before I sign the shoe mud bog with how much is a very means of Conquest once it off respectful of base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan
engineering Ryan Reese you the Super Bowl she was being the two mothers are swapped to the goddess of learning and then she'll be asked to Dave the author not stop racially botheration it's okay Buck theater bobbity nice sticky a regular tennis and classes in the bottom of tongue and my rendering Services a devotees all of this Troublesome the heart we could eradicate it 11:00 service to the Supreme Lord who is Levi Services Supreme Lord who is race
 why am I hitting a wall here we go to bed my heart I was born in the darkness of ignorance to my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet so I don't I just want you to know that many people came up to me on this trip ago hey Rock enough I doubled
I would love to see a show on the message board if you did double it cuz it was pretty interesting if you didn't get my book go to amazon.com and if you did get it write a review and if you doubled it let us know right now okay multi copies to friends who did that
 a lot of people bought a lot of copies and there's a limit on Amazon how many goodbye cuz they think you're a bot and then I think you're trying to hoard them that's raised the price no no no the weather think you doing is actually think you're trying to increase the sales to make it a best-seller
 no yeah I know that's cuz you know who did that that was their strategy of them
 that's what's up. Tell Ron Hubbard and what is that called Scientology
that's not why I'm doing it I asked why I think so much of the professionals they think your boat's it's your turn to take your horde the fraud I fist you and you open another account sell them
 and it's a crummy Vai book to not buy it as did you see that the AI Ray capos life story book that's been replaced all the time right this book can I guess you not buy the fake Ray cappo book so we were in the reading today from trimen valve Town Contra 7 chapter 7 in total what SRI Prasad learned in the womb little Pearl on when he was in the movie learn the stuff now he's out of the womb and sharing it with his little friends
and he described the practice of Bucky beginning just was you know you're not this body and get you to understand all that and then building up to like the real practice about to you know like
 service to Guru you know bring your mind and then shoving a to them tomorrow. I'll probably saving a arch in them all of that he spoke about that and he said through that you'll be able to see God within the heart of every living being you know that connection was drawn there that this isn't just like religious that you have faith and then your saved but he said no you'll get this deep realization that you see God was in the heart of every. This was text 32 waist and said once it's good versus beautiful versus Runners one should always remember the Supreme personality pattern is localized representation as a part of mamahuhu situated in the core of every living entities heart that's one should offer aspects to every living entity according to their living according to that live
entities position or manifestation we spoke about that last show and then we had text 33 which shows the results of that now we're getting into this text 33 is going to show our did show cuz we read this already to it shows the primary and secondary results of the practice of bhakti the secondary result of stuff that we just got the secondaries all this it's like such an accomplishment you become free from that the six enemies threatened us
 lust anger greed lose your Madness and jealousy and then the primary results
 is that in this way one surely attains the platform of loving service of the springboard called Rocky and he had spoke about Russia before this this attachment this like loving attachment that one feels in the heart forgot and threw out for a living being that's the result of body that's why it's before and not from Moksha
right not not for any of the things of this world for karma not for from Moksha not for just getting like this peace and relief from the sufferings of this work is actually this Divine love that they won't contain in today's text text 34 goes into detail about what actually what one experiences in that state of conscious I had a text 34 and I just realized that in my astrological chart I have the combination of planets called Moksha Yoga oh yeah I remember you saying that means you're like it almost sounded like you're done, I know I know but am I done like that he said I said that he could do whatever he wants and I don't want the picture as soon as I mean he can do everything watch it and no no no do whatever you want you're good you got to go back to that I forgot my license to get a pass whatever happens is going to work out
anyway I text 34-34 one who is situated in devotional service is certainly the controller of the senses
 and Dusty is liberated he's a liberated person with such liberated persons the pure devoted years of the when such a liberated person if you're devoting hears of the transit of the qualities in activities of the Lord's incarnations for the performance of various pastimes his hair stands on end the end of his body and tears fall from his eyes and it is spiritual realization his voice Alters sometimes he's very sometimes he's very openly dances sometimes he sings loudly and sometimes he cries. She expresses is Transcendental Jubilation Elko this is how the box of Yogi controls the senses we use our senses to serve Krishna it's interesting because once you think of a yogi controlling the senses you think of some
he has a real guy fasting and he's sitting in one place and he's wearing just a rag now everything is now used in the service of the Lord you don't have to wear Rags you can dress very beautifully but you're not doing it for your ego you're doing it to I want to dress up nice and service of the Lord I want to cook and eat delicious food but I want to do it because I'm making this beautiful offering to the Lord I want to do you keep your hell nice and clean. Just because when people come over and I want them to think I'm a pig you're keeping it clean cuz it's your temple and everything is just shifted in the Consciousness but all those things which usually go to the ego are now going to your own personal Enlightenment it's not cutting away it's not being a thiagi or a
 renuncia it's real renunciation
 yeah and and then look at the results these it it provided here saying that these results
 they almost look like a purse
who's like a materialist they're crying
 I getting all excited to try and get excited materialist you're asking me of the deliberated person do I get it there Beyond's crying about this and being excited about that they have this even my yeah yeah so but here that you know the generals that so excited that like they got goosebumps there that excited you know they got tears in their eyes their voice is faltering the can't even speak because you know they're dancing around and Channing do that you know when SRI chaitanya this is Chick Tony Chargin Rita this most
 important super elevated you know text about bhakti the life of shirt onion in the teachings of Auntie it describes this this time or cheat on you as a body yoga sanyasi rights
he's wearing the clothes of the city and see whether or not she had to do with the orange cloth in the shaved head and he goes to Varanasi which was like the stronghold
 Aldi my very senior sister did the in-person senior see the ones that let you know who did not die
 the form of God that they think everything is one any type of form is illusion God has no form ultimately we are all part of that one energy and our individuality is an illusion all that is it's all they they they they hear about all this new sanyasi that's visiting the town There's a new kid in town he's in all these people are getting interested in a statically he's very tall and beautiful and very beautiful to see and he was he was singing and dancing through the town and crime which any chance you don't usually do it a little bit more stoic a little bit more Bruce Lee this was crying he's blowing up
he's got to be up for boys kiss singing songs that almost sound like
 it's almost sounds like he's saying it's just like romantic songs you know like like he just caught up in mundane romance or something like that that they were they were like this this is not the right way that it's in Yahtzee supposed to behave this is wrong little bit the cold or is it not yet this is not the way that it is and and there's some devotees that really understood him they're in town they're kind of Hosting him and and didn't you they were sharing these criticisms and it was breaking their hearts they just said we don't go breaking my heart because because yeah when you fall in love with somebody that he kills you to hear criticism about him yeah and end so they were hoping
he could somehow speak with them and influence them and because of seeing the broken hearts of his of his those that were his devotees shoot a time you went to a gathering where all of these there are a lot of them you have to imagine like they're all like the stoic hardcore renuncia you know the people into philosophy they have this did they kind of root it out all sentimentality out of their hearts and out of their minds and they get together and they eat they discuss they don't the Sutra you know they didn't get a chance to Doris's can endorse a type of boldness from the material world are interpretation of it did end in so they could they get into these very technical philosophical conversation so you know
 and shoot attorney goes to that guy
and rather than kind of like he he he he had two things that he spoke to them with what part of it was his learning I was hard to be a fly on the wall in that Gallery it's so beautiful he he he eventually he speaks to them so it's his learned through his his learning that he he convinces them but right from the beginning there two things that caught the attention and kind of opened the hearts
 of the my buddy cianci's and that was his Beauty and his humility alright beauty can open the heart is this beautiful man you go it did not only was he beautiful but he was actually like a falchion like literally fought him like he was glowing like Beyond it was like whoa I've never seen it that ever happen for like his body was glowing and so that
and and but also he didn't walk into the middle of thing and said you're all wrong and I'm right he sat down in the most humble please set that like off to the side where like everyone puts their shoes and stuff so I could not even get woke go every two washes their feet is kind of like considered like the worst seat in the house and it's only showing some respect in a bit of the protocol is generally they're giving some nice seasoned seeing as I'm the bitter Prestige he sat down in the very humble humble of seats and he just started glowing in the candle and that made them approached him rather than saying hey you you guy that's doing the wrong thing that's growing up the Dharma rather than approach that with it kind of feels like we don't understand you you know you're obviously like a special person why don't you come and spend time with us and and and why are you doing these things why are you dancing and cold
in our circles cuz tuba as long as we've been around we've met people who are just embody this deep humility and humility is not a fake thing like I said I'm going to ask humble it's like when you actually see your position would become like soft when you see your your part of something much bigger you're not the center it's not about you when you meet people like that it's so attractive
 there's something to when you humility is based on deep realization true humility we can act with humility and that's a good thing that's pretty good relation okay well then you're not really acting as you're not being a but the Deep truth deep humility
 it's there's a realist a depth of realization depth of understanding it
that my happiness and my well-being is not dependent on my achieving a false position in this world being seen in a particular way holding a position being seen a particular way my happiness is entirely disconnected from that and since so I don't need to pursue those things now I can actually be truly I'm just a little spark spark but but but but but I'm a spark of pure Ananda I'm a spark of bliss I don't need to fight or compete or establish myself in any way to feel is a matter fact when I do that I'm an illusion and I lose touch with my Bliss lose touch with that Natural Bliss that I have so so yeah that is that that the person that's got got real depth of realization their humble there they're not out to try to
 only people call
steal your thunder or was that called I love that phrase is to thunder stealer Thunder stealer Thunder stealer Thunder or you know compete for something that has no value and so then they're humble so it's so they saw him sitting there like that he was sitting I need the fantasy where's the fantasy suite and he gave to be in that fancy seat so then they brought him in a vitamin and then he began to speak
 the debacle of a doctor that the the devotional and understanding of a don't have to turn it on to the
beta the at the conclusion of the beta by that and you know what they said they said like prakashananda sarswati was the name of the
 did that that leads to your auntie like the guru of everyone but I believe it said like his kind of number to man like his you know like the next never would have got it in his best student you like the best
 he got up and he said the way that you've now explained they don't you know this is commentaries on when we use the word vedanta most common people referring to the upanishads right like because they come at the end of The Vedas like there's a the four Vedas and attached to each of the four Vedas are different punish others are they they done to it at the end and shankara the vet
a super incredibly influential sanyasi and philosopher he took certain versus certain sutras
 and he called them these are my avocados these are like the big instructions
 are are are teachers at GB goswami will come in and said he kind of randomly did that he chose certain ones and said they all need to be seen in relation to these ones
 but treat a tiny Sedona do you contact them I have a q that something you're misunderstanding holding you like you no talk to him to see your famous sutures like this he said nothing can be understood you can understand this all as very consistent with an understanding that that ultimately there's one supreme that they own it down on JT haven't seen any of this one Supreme Being that all other living beings are stained by you know we're all,
by Nature we're all Eternal by nature but some of us these little Sparks are maintained by the one original energy you know the clean version of all in the end that's Krishna and in so in this way he explained vedant in a way that they never heard it before
 and they're like all and when they do that disciple got up and you said hearing this explanation from you all day. So we haven't heard it like this before this is like a shower of nectar and is it any said and it's kind of like all along when we were talking of it onto this impersonal non-personal way it was like we're eating dry dry rice cakes you know like it was like they have those things that we have nowadays like just a dry it's kind of flavors of the biggest change is just like that movie Sixth Sense ever see that Sixth Sense the whole time
this kid is a little kid is like I see dead people I see dead people
 I got to watch this whole movie again now the whole time he was I got to go back and look at it in a whole new way
 paradigm shift with a brother that was a real what do they call that a spoiler
 my now but the movies 30 years old he cannot come give us spoil that's what I want one but it's one of those things like it changes the way you look at the entire movie now so when you study of vedanta you've done it for years you've been memorize the versus you take it up the tradition you become a senior officer you'd given up the world and all the sudden I see dead people yeah there's a God and I'm not God it's okay we should eat
we offered to God why am I wearing this I'm going to buy a fancy courts and now it'll be completely God realized in any case this verse is saying you were here and then we're here in this tomorrow we'll hear more about this the kids maybe they had some little understanding of a Dunta and they thought that all the liberated people are not qualities like you know singing and dancing and crying and all that you know no no no this is the other end this is when you come out the other end you know there's Brahmin realization and then there's part of Mama realization Altimas is Bhagavad on it and when you feel that the love and the Ecstasy that you feel you get these involuntary

 realize realize we aren't in control it's boring one. You see you just judge it and you became the critic hear that every time I do know there is a lot there in that it's just like it's a suture but then you don't know what to do without really thinking about it then you don't go into the deck size we already control okay we walk around
