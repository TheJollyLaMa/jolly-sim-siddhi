 but she's doing such a nice service so everybody really grateful so it's q and a day and words are listed as where his first year on the list
 let's start with Bob Ananda Bhavan under come on down
 you can sit right with us and look right in the screen right there so we can see yourself
so answer the questions today and probably under the longtime listener to the podcast he's been traveled with us before and you're an old old school Harry Krishna advani I want you to speak to Mike and look at yourself in the in the little box on Zoom so we can make sure you're on camera okay so tell us your story how you get back to you how I got into bhakti well I can say that I'm very glad to see Maharaj and yellow today and yesterday on when he arrived because that is my first recollection of meeting to vote was in the western prairies in Canada when I was 10 years old in 1967 I saw devotees on the street corner singing and dancing and even in my ten-year-old mind I could recognize that there was something very important that these people were committed to to make them be so unconventional enter
West Indies yellow bed sheets and then I have to admit it took me some time to determine for myself what that was but you know it's a long time wonderful so I'm dressed in Memoria. I was in the program for a short. Of time in Los Angeles doesn't matter what I came out to material life and drifted in and out of bhakti over those yours and since meeting rakkanoth about six years ago I keep getting drawn in closer and closer each year how did we meet we met at a yoga and music festival in the Catskill Mountains I think six years ago you were the first presenter of a yoga program and so I thought who is this rug enough guy sounds interesting I will go over there to his
yoga class and after the first one I knew this fellow has something and I canceled all my other classes to go to every other one that he got didn't do that anyway you seen this Christmas sets the hook like the fishermen they set the hook and then let you run with the hook for a while and then the fish eventually just wears out material world gets exhausting and then Christian starts to reel you in so thank you for having me up for my question and Maharaj I have had very recent tragedy in my life
 just less than two months ago I lost my partner of 40 years and she was at the end of a very long physical illness so I was with her at her pass
and it was very it was very magical very beautiful and she was very happy I don't have a lot of issue and coming to terms with that however very soon after that I also lost my adult daughter who was apparently now at the end of a very long mental illness that she had a life at least for the last 15 years that was not had no happiness in it she had pain and she had suffering and this was very difficult to watch was her in such a traumatic State most of the time and everything that I did I could not bring her out of it
 and so is she just decided that it was time for her to leave this material planet
 and it's a tragic
not only for the loss of a young person but you know in the sense that she had to live for so many years and such a desperate State and when I hear other people's comments and my selves What I Hear most often is at least she is not suffering any longer and from the dharmic perspective people say well you know this life didn't work out maybe there will be better luck next time
 so I'm wondering of these two
 thought Pathways were either of those legitimate from the bakhtiar vaishnav sense in our tradition
 I do I get a dried did she leave this world by her own by her own accord yes
 young I mean there are two perspectives
the first is a
 that is pain and we should acknowledge it and not fill of philosophy Sidibe amazing Pastime in the Mahabharata the big bore
 there a Juna son album on you is brutally killed by six powerful code of our generals and and really the word brutal has to be used and fortunately it was unfair it was 6 of the most accomplished Warriors against one use a bazillion when this happened I do not didn't sit on the side and philosophize the coming and going of the Soul
I'm so honest Chivas and profound grave enter
 Kushner sit by his side of us by side and walked with him through the grieving
 I have seen this in great Masters they have grieved for people who have gone through such suffering and they had been questioned by the students are you are so exalted why do you cry Tia Tia over the living in the death see you you should be impartial the soul is eternal and just won the Saint but then this great mastership said you have not understood so yes this human grief is part of this life but there is a
parallel Road also infect SB goes through life we have to remind ourselves constantly that we live in parallel realities unfortunately one of this reality's is Switched Off for most of the people that you've already undergoing a human stories mother's happiness and distress grief and celebration Mi all this goes on that is the Eternal Soul For Whom there is no purse no is there any death
 so let the human side and you cry and feel grief and let the Awakening spertus I'd understand that the soul is unaffected by the this coming and going
you have to live with parallel realities if you only live in one vial that you have your legs into one in the human one in the spirit of you do understand you might develop into
 person who is not connected really with the two realities there are these two realities so very practical yes it is it's a Pity when someone is so desperate that with their own hand of it's usually fits the body and serves the well-being of the body they act against each other that is a lot of desperation and there are few things you can do to now benefit this so let's let's look on
Bellevue have influence where we can do it in Portland us not be overcome by grief alone one thing is you can definitely how long is the respect when you left I lost your daughter
 I want sex with not so long so you can ask good priests who know how to do these things to do a letter, and little Jackie and then this girl that the benefit will go to wherever she is and help her in the next news. So to say that is something very very beneficial you can also on your own as the father
 you give the fatherly blessings you can sit down at a peaceful time perhaps
sake of a place like that is it beautiful Temple room here but you can also do that at home remind remember your daughter and I remember the Lord and then in this triangle you
 your daughter the Lord in the safe triangle and then you put your prayers poo they are very powerful even post-mortem then the person has gone they list what you can do so that way I can be performed many good priests in the back of the traditional can do this for you and on an individual note do the prayer triangle with a good intention the person for whom you
and then a lot is a very powerful and very powerful
 I have seen with this triangle America's mother's who couldn't give birth what is the best bus coming yes and people who had illnesses recoveries which they call in medicine spontaneous recovery at the rediclinic and so on and all this I believe in prayer and all situations when we human beings are at the end of olive B which it does happen often it's time to turn to the Almighty
 okay thank you very much and I really appreciate your comments and what am I in
transfer our Retreat here was to associate with friends and devotees and exalted persons in order to help me gain the emotional capacity to undertake such practices if you have recommended so thank you very much thank you
 so much humility you can all but next time you have this time alone with this Krishna you can pray for this child of yours and the father and and everyone's yes does it smell real good a long way I always say and you can correct me but from what I understand
to the degree that I become Krishna conscious I'm affecting my children I'm affecting my deceased father I'ma affecting my 98 year old mother to the degree that I become Krishna conscious is the best thing I can do for my mother that's what I could do for my father would you say that's a correct statement yes been my father of us on his deathbed I asked I was in India second place I asked should I come and be of assistance and he said guess what he said I think you are of the greatest assistance to me there at the holy place while you do your holy thing because I can feel the benefit already coming from
from there to be the button you go a step further yes they are statements in the scriptures that if someone has become Krishna conscious then so many generations before him and after him that this your children they are derived the benefit they are so to say electrified with spiritual benefits is there connection it's like what's the goal of what we do anyway to love and serve the devotees so your whatever your relationship was you loved her and she loved you
 and therefore you served each other whether you liked it or not and she's making some Eternal benefit its great people are very quick to say especially once they get around at all these for a while and they'll sail suicide completely inauspicious and yeah the person will not come back as I hear you'll be some ghostly thing I think it's much much different or person practicing bhakti it's not of this
Brown we can't use the same math and I feel like we should take that seriously and say this is not an ordinary daughter to be born of a very spiritually minded father that's just not a normal birth
 yes it is oh yeah there are many statements one participant in the crowd just left message that is this I don't do carry episode where he was delivered by his brother know who was fully Krishna Consciousness don't do carry it would like to hear what he did a very simple person and but he was delivered to buy his exalted brother yes so
you said I would like it everyone to take a special note of this and Mathematics you can use formulas for certain problems but they can't use them for other problems or a problem is maybe means he thinks you need to calculate sew-in in bhakti really the ordinary mathematics of this World falls down sloppy day here too you know they have to come to another logic all together just like a good couple here Thorson Vanessa Vanessa is ready to have baby
 very exciting and we get a little gift for the child yesterday not in ordinary
this is not an ordinary birth to be born to two very spiritually Focus people that is not an ordinary child and
 we can't imagine the Good Fortune of this child growing up in a household with the parents are so connected a lot of us didn't have that growing up a lot of us had parents that were not only disconnected they weren't even around and so it is a very very fortunate child and very fortunate circumstance
 okay Maharaj what's bringing our desk or next contestant come on down
 turn on the AK Road Rage or regular on Zoom
 and his wonderful brother
 twin brother identical twin brother and he's from Croatia he's got a beautiful Krishna conscious family and we want you to look right
so you can see yourself cuz I see you talk into the mic and
 road rage what's going on your life you lived in the ashram for a while you got into bhakti what was where you hurt you are hard-core guy right 90s yeah yeah so I was actually driving a skateboard a sixteen-year-old thinking myself to be you know a revolutionary I'm so different then you're fine. You're exactly the same as everybody else but then I met both of us saying you know devotees actually my mother she said please go to this program you know there's some interesting program I don't want you to be just material reminded and I I came and that's when I saw you vote is for the first time and I was immediately hooked as they say and yeah yeah my mother
send it so that's on her now
 and yeah that's that's my story and I'm not beautiful and so is he and his brother are filmmakers in Croatia and they just finished a wisdom of the sages app or free as of incredible Index right here for everybody but when the app is released then I'll do a presentation you know I'll put it on Discord of the wisdom of the sages I'm very excited but I don't want to spoil the surprise.
 Okay so what's your question
 I wanted to ask you Maharaj I know you were a sanyasi so you know my question is regarding children
 and how to help help our children grow up into
conscious person's Krishna conscious person and I know I just sent a slew of course but I feel you have a lot of disciples who are your children we are guiding through this process and also among them certainly a lot of them who are Green has this involve children themselves and I'm sure you helped me in a lot of those situations hi I just wanted to kind of pick your brain to see if you have any advice what can be done because it today coincidentally I just want to mention is that is the Father's Day to all the fathers out there a big ass clap
 the other half of the equation overlooked underappreciated
 sorry I did thank you much and especially perhaps because it doesn't live in a
Community lives on his own his professional what have you seen you have a lot of disciples probably that has one principal you have to find something that interests the children you come to resent any of anything Spirits as you think is interesting you have to see that the fire of enthusiasm comes from this end I I want to give you an example and then you have this I wanted to say what interests a child is very young it's one thing when they are in 18 group than the other when they grow older and sometimes you really they they they the changes by the day other than Grosso
I had to learn this damn difficult way I live in a community which has many children. It is I think it is the greatest community and Germany and in terms of members and so on
 maybe now the signature lymphoma his even more but this is an important community and the parents said why don't we have a spirit of education for our children and the best one is a Swami teach them so every
 sometimes weakling weekly sometimes bi-weekly I had something like a Sunday school for the children
I was teaching them little stories usually from the Bhagavad Tom and I was taking questions who is married to the 5 lb of us into your driver to ask these things and the children are almost wrestling who could answer this question do you know that I had them and so on and then one day I noticed that the attendance at the dog out sometimes it happens but then I noticed how some of the children begin to look at mobile telephones but I was trying to interest them in spiritual things
and as I continued I thought I saw that my style of teaching and presenting was no longer capturing capturing the interest and at that time I said to the parents I'm I'm losing my my audience I can feel it I think I should do we should discontinue and do something else but they've are so attached that I do it and it had gone very well very well they came back home and told the stories to the parents and and so on so I have a soft heart and that I was divorced by the affection of the parents to continue but that was not the right thing I was simply no longer able
to catch the interest I had
 I lost the game stick talk and all these interesting groovy things that I noticed I believe but I do not have the same thing with his children how can I catch the interest of the children that I think you are the best one I want to talk about it I noticed your children that the two boys became with Dan God love us which is something which boys like you know to beat on drums is very attractive to them and you have these these up and you invite them to come on the retreat and I think that is also an adventurous
Todd Park maybe they go to Adventure park or something you have to somehow figure out what is of interest in New York to beautiful girls and they are so wise and so I live these two girls of Matilda and and and then you need to see Vic can you supply something where they can also be exposed to spirituality in one big things I asked for this and then dragged or not you you as a father should speak of one thing is if they have friends that always works
 because
 the children they they just now they want to be good with others say they need friends and that who speak the same language would like also wrestling
Boys album if the boys have any longer be as boys wrestle and so on this appoint about interest is so interesting yesterday I asked a two-year-old child what is your favorite favorite Bhajan and she answered Ronaldo that is a football player so how this child has developed
 so you have to go buy a dress.
it was good what do you do what you know I thought I was second in Senate and Irma are the culture bhakti it's we are not a quote religion That Conquers by the sword we're not interested in holding a sword of someone's head and convert or you'll die and that's been the tradition a lot in different abrahamic Traditions you see that a lot it's a tradition that wins you over by culture and the culture is so deep and so beautiful so you mentioned in a dunga or Museum in music is so attractive The Cure times are so attractive to people that if they can get attached to a musical instrument we're singing if that's their proclivity then they want to go to wear those cure times are happening to fit in with that but there's so many different things and we're in the job also as people who speak about Krishnan share with other people but also his parents is
we are at a job of Building Bridges so if there's an island here in the island there how can I get from this island to that island so if I have a child popped out in the material world how can I bring them to an island of God Consciousness what will be that bridge for them and is going to be unique and sometimes it's going to be a little tough and sometimes I got to do backflips to make it happen but it's I think the best thing I could do for my kids was I would take them to Indy on a regular basis but that's a unique situation cuz I would go to Indy on a regular basis but I remember at one point
 I just saw you know they're old enough just bring in the so and and and then then seeing the ganga worshipping the deity here in kirtan having such some that just became the new normal you know it's not a weird thing to see a Puja it's a very normal thing and you know ultimately every child
start a fly their own plane every child we bringing their world we hope for the best for them I think everybody feels that way we want to give them what we hold precious the realtor comes to a point of the child's life where they say Krishna is for me it's not like I just want to do this cuz my parents are doing it this is for me cuz Christian has my Lord and so that that comes and it that's up to that really all we can do is best is sort of like in courage in the best we can but I did get to a point in my life where I was going out and doing a program here and then taking a group to India there and they're doing a retreat for a weekend here and it was divorced for my children and
 back in Britain the Consciousness but there's a desert a spiritual desert and I have to start looking Beyond Myself and figuring out how I can build all these Bridges because
 to have your kids every parent wants their kids to be successful have a career
have a happy marriage have children xcetera but if we get if they get all those things but don't have a substantial relationship with God our hearts will be broken because we find that that will be the most it's the most substantial thing that we have going we want them to have that so we have to think alike how can I build a bridge how can I get a community how can I develop Brett like-minded friends you know if it breaks my heart that my you know my son Rockwood doesn't live with me but I know it for the he lives with the majority and the beautiful family in in Alachua during the school year but he has so many good quality and in teenage years friendship is everything it's all about friendship and when their friendship of good caliber like he is Kishore right here he's a good caliber you know
what is friendships of good caliber it makes all the difference in the world because the people we associate with especially in their teenage years can make all the difference how many people have died in their teenage years from just hanging out with the wrong group of kids and their life takes a radical hairpin turn from the sweet kids sitting on your knee and all of a sudden somebody's in prison somebody's dead so it happens all the time so we have to be thinking like this and I think every parent getting in box he has that on the Forefront of their minds Building Bridges I hope that was useful for both thank you so much thank you love you road rage highball
 he has the name road rage because one day I was driving and I was sort of spaced out while I was driving and I just I'm so attached add prone that I was
and I just slowed down my car almost like going like a regular fastroad but in the countryside and there was a car right behind me and I didn't see anything it came up on my quick and the guy just got all road rage on me is there screaming like stopped his car got out of his car and I was like I was not I was thinking of like beautiful things in my mind I'm like a garlanding Krishna something like that and he's screaming at me and I said I put my hands like a prayer and I said
 I'm sorry I totally respect forgive me I said like that to the guy and I was like how angry is this person like I could have been like nothing this falling asleep at the wheel or you just like ready to try to kill me and I was like and I just said publicly on Zoom is anybody experience road rage is anybody go through that and he came out so the name stuck since then and then four
we're going to visit him in Croatia and unfortunately he's driving but we will see if you will live up to your Monica
 who's the actress Mara come on down re a big part of our Super Soul Community lives in New York City who was the boxing Center on a regular basis
 inspired Saul Premiere comes on look yourself in the camera they're talking to the microphone tell your story I know you've been on the podcast before a little bit but a little bit how you got here
 I'm sure I'll see if I can distill it down I had a Dark Night of the Soul about 8 years ago and I pray for guidance and I Heard a Voice in my heart and I said move near Tompkins Square Park I didn't really know about yeah I didn't know about the Hari Krishna tree or anything but I moved near there
and then I ended up getting connected to the Barclay Center and then met Robin costume there the bhakti center in and the rest was history that's a crazy story the void in your heart said move near Tompkins Square Park so if you're new to this whole thing Tompkins Square Park is he knows where the grimy Park when me and jeeva were growing up it was the grimiest to park they called it a needle Park and not because they were knitting needles there there were other texts have needles there and
 yeah that that that shines and sort of like it's the birthplace of kirtan in America cuz our power on guru carguru guru
 he started sitting under this tree and just chanting the maha-mantra and rows of beatniks and hippies gathered around and that's sort of the The Hub of the wheel a boxy tradition in the West Was there an interesting voice in the heart instructed you as find this fascinating
yes and I just wanted to say Maharaj thanks so much for your presence really grateful for the association and Rocco Americus tuba really grateful to be here with all of you and yeah my my question is that you know when in the material world by play humble leadership role at work with performing artists BJ's specifically I have a team that I work with and as a leader or there's there's always ups and downs and there's challenges and there's
 you know I think been some some challenges it's a challenging. For us I think we've actually growing stronger together but our relationships first and put my spiritual life first as a foundation to everything I do and that but sometimes just you know the pendulum swim the pendulum swings in a negative way that
there's no easy explanation so we're going through some speed bumps right now and I was just wondering you know for anyone who is a leader whether there are an entrepreneur or a parent or whatever or serve leadership role they might be playing in life if you might have some insights into how someone can be a great leader in times of struggle and challenge the whole yes yes I know someone who knows where they are going and who can Inspire others to go with him and follow him
 beyond that I want to say
 it is necessary for the leader to make regular
 that puts its in the in the relationships with those
he leads
 they used to be a time then
 Boletus of any kind will just automatically get people to follow them thought about hiring she's
 that's not how any one feels nowadays but just because someone is above me I am a mess for what they say that thinking is is gone is flown out of the windows since long and it's also not there in spirit to community so much you have to give an example as the leader of what you are speaking and you have to to care for the people and and then they need to to to see that that you care for them that you love for them
you need to do the things that you don't have to do her but wish you do the only explanation is that you you like once a person understands this person dies not out of personal motivation but he cares for me then they do everything so so give a gift presents give attentions take care of the small things and then people will follow you if and only if you do this with the affection I want to give an example from psychology
 Davis months and autistic child and a very good psychologist who try to help this autistic child
do you all understand the world autism autistic not that they are in their own world they can't speak they can't communicate they are like prisoners be hide invisible wall expect very thick boards that they can't take anything in the content and usually they they suffer in this lonely lonely lonely world in which they are so this pleiku therapist had been working with this child for I think four or five years and then one day he got an idea please give me your pencil like this
 and he threw it
to the child like this and he said
 give back the pencil and the child
 reached out of his own little bird
 took the pencil and gave it to the psychotherapist apply go to are pissed right through the dam now as soon he will come out and yes the child was cured after this because he could reach out this was the first time in this life so he went to an International Conference at one year later and presented his Discovery and his Discovery became known as the Hanson pencil therapy all the place I go to therapy together 2000 went back and new
look for autism it's the pain cetera p.m. how many successes do you think they had
 none not only not one single one because it was not the pencil it was the love behind it and said they had no you know he had worked five years with this handicapped child and the pencil was second place the love was first place and I believe a really very strongly that you give your employees of the people who work with you in your DJ company if you give them a little attention has a loving heart and here I must say that's possible venue
see them with the ice of a backed-up if you see the best part of Krishna you see that there I need to have some contact with Krishna and and really and is that way they will all become they they they will become I live in a very difficult area in Germany that these people are too. All but many choose right right-wing parties and the battery because I care for my Davis I'm living there. And give a friendly word for everyone when they buy has built-in bench for me where you can do your meditation and all these things you know Spanish and because it's the affection which you bring into the the thing in the back. Can do it he can even
I have sympathy for people he would never associate otherwise because he see some family brother sister related to 202 Acushnet
 so yes so don't just bring a pencil with you bring the other pencil method will not work and they affectionately still. So be there bring the love thank you Ari
 that was nice Moorish
 it's sort of the motivating force between it and everything that we do it was like that's sort of the goal of what we're trying to do and this is the only thing that you got everything else is a pain in the
okay well that's all our questions we took does anybody else have a question that didn't get to ask a question you come on down now
 yours is too intense
 are we ready for Justin's intense question come on down Justin come on down here bunky
 okay he says it's intense but we're desperate for a question here cuz everyone else is unprepared
 will you get a camera and just tell your question
 we're bracing ourselves I'm right into the camera all the microphone see yourself on the camera and speak right into it
 re Krishna I will everybody heart of the matter is I'm back with another groundbreaking question
so prior to discovering bhakti I was a very very accomplished, that's a Avid psychonaut which psychonaut is a person who
 explores the
 mental psychic rounds like the dream realm through psychedelics I did a lot of psychedelics and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a huge experimenter by the grace of Krishna I always came back and I didn't go to I mean I went really far but I always came back and I didn't do any permanent damage was just wonderful and
 in a start-up recreationally and then it became more intentional and then eventually I started to
doit ceremonially
 and
 here and there like I would sit for a certain people so in 2016 I was in a really really really bad car accident and in the car accident a lot of terrible things happen but most of all of my dog died and he was thrown from the vehicle and
 if you make it so it was only five so I only had him for like half of his life but it took me about like 3 years to recover and
 haven't cried about that in a long time baby cuz I'm on camera but about three years to recover and I owe my recovery to very deep psychedelic work a lot of work with mushrooms and I and I'm talking about like not microdosing was like about Mack Road
what it would have called heroic doses by yourself in a room lights off closed just in her work right and and I've approached by certain people in my life to sit for them like hold space for them while they do psychedelic work and since discovering bhakti I have like a bit of a conundrum because I'm not supposed to take intoxicants but when I'm holding space for people
 I've tried it sober and I've tried it not sober and when I'm not sober
 it's like I'm able to connect with them better and also they they have told me that I'd that I'm more effective when I'm with them on the past not sober what does that mean on the mushrooms what you're on the mushrooms with them okay it's not like you're drunk
on alcohol you're on the medicine as they say so I guess
 it's another kind of like conundrum like a like an impasse Where do I
 do I kind of stick to the no intoxicants thing or is it is there a loophole here
 for oral like with time will I develop the ability to do it sober through boxes it doesn't make sense add something to let you know lately a lot of these people I listen to a podcast it's coming up with a lot of experiments that people are buried trauma something traumatic happened their childhood they just don't even remember it anymore and it's manifesting in their adult life in some horrible horrible habits
they're horrible horrible choices and they're finding that through this type of therapy where it's not in the mood of let's go out and party at the Grateful Dead concert but let's actually try to uncover the actual using as medicine so people could bring up this argument you hope you're calling this sort of an intoxicant but isn't morphine an intoxicant how many times do we think twice about giving a person morphine if they're in pain but we won't do this if it's also uncovering trauma to help a person deal with it so this is a huge thing and conversation right now about do our hallucinogenics actually medicine are they not running away from your problems but actually facing them in a healthier way instead of thousands of hours of talk therapy which often times doesn't prove effective keeps the person in their trauma never less than never less than shake it and leaves them with Incredible anxiety
bad habits bad choices at cetera and we would like your opinion on that I would like I would like it too
 I became aware of this when I was in the now you've Eric hospital and red medicine or a magazine that it was said that a certain type of mushrooms is really helping people who are very deep into depression very deep I mean those who do not know what depression is like like me I have not had this mean sometimes one is a little sad and Melancholy but that's not near Liberty pression is it can drive you to a suicide it can be so heavy so in this case I I read in the magazine
what is this mushroom which is the summary searched the most made and so on but yes but it's not allowed in Germany magazine ended that article ended so yeah I knew about this and then
 I do feel
 that there are areas where spiritual people
 it should be amongst should not in in the bay in them
 give me a recommendation where they are not expert in because
 and I think they are areas where one can say well that is
information is there on the market and you know need to look into it and decide they have done this week ago when someone very close to me was asking me and I said yes that is this information why don't you do some research on this and then see yourself what what way to go I I feel that's the safest because if I say no don't take it because I have some information better no drugs that this brings you away from spirituality I don't address the question that listen to use something that helps can we take it to get rid of a terrible evil it's not about
recreational drug now if I say yes take this
 I have not done the research I do not know at least areas when I read the medical medicine about this it says some say but the other say is this
 you know this borderline questions and each individual needs to wisely decided and I think by this empowering people and taking a decision for them we don't do a favor for them via monks we can give the satvik methods that that's our life satvik means live no meat no fish no eggs no illicit relationships with the with ladies when you exploit them Alyssa a text.
that's not good vs no lying no gambling and intoxication usually smokes up your brain and then you can see clearly but here is another situation I'm aware of this medical thing
 yeah so so I always say you know I'm I am able to give you tips about how to spell to life and how to progress into this you need to explore explore yourself and then they take the responsibility and that is good for them in the overall weight. Please tell me what do you think about this
