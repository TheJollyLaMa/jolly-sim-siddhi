now is the time for sure Now's the Time it a great day and had a great morning this morning we got on rickshaws early and we headed towards the famous jagannath temple say it's from from the 605 500 what was happening in the 500s
 I don't know
 that's about all I know is that amazing like there was a whole century and we don't even know what happened then and it's not like it's prehistory prehistoric like
 as arrogant as I am I think oh my God my life is so important my issues are such big issues heart world problems are so big 500 right no one's going to remember this
 that's what I remember I should say
yeah I made a Little Caesars out of media and all of that kind of things that'll be around but I washed away
 I haven't had a Christmas miracle I want to share somebody wrote in can I share it this is from James Rogers
 he said that this was good hey I'm James from England and I'm one of the others I thought you might like to hear about my mystical Krishna miracle I started listening to Wiz with the sages about 2 years ago it was my only entry into bhakti Krishna conscious lifestyle there are no temples near to my town and I had not met any other devotees at the time my practice was limited to only exclusively listening to the podcast Channing a couple of rounds and reading the data where was he is an interesting that that's the cool thing about this podcast
town and Village People don't know devotees and we have a lot of people are there are others out there that listen they're like yeah I don't know where he's at. I don't live near any temples and it's sort of exciting anyway last year I went on a vacation to Tenerife with my wife and children we booked a random apartment to stay on the south of the island is the Canary Islands I woke up on the first morning to the sound of a ching ching ching little did I know I booked an apartment directly above the iskcon temple in Tenerife
 it wasn't above and to the left or above and to the right it literally was directly above how insane is that I told the temple president about my strange coincidence and he said if you take a step towards Krishna you will make it
easy to take 10 more towards you
 question for you sure if you went to the Canary Islands to get away and then you got you got in your room you just spread out and relax and then you heard ching ching ching would you be like yes over to be like okay can you give can you get the Sunday please class and can you clean the pots and sends them for you look at me sometimes when you're really crazy stories but I'm not
position to go crazy has got me when I needed him most so yeah hug me a nugget I got one of your friend
 this is the Nugget it's like a meme he took from Instagram it seems yes or no no permits are not from Instagram it's a block shaped like a quote but it's not the other
 thank does it from God's it's his for Mother Teresa one of our favorite mothers
 God speaks in the Silence of the heart listening
 is the beginning of Prayer
 listening is the beginning of prayer sounds like we need to come our mind a lot to hear God Speak
sometimes in the mind doesn't come we think it's coming from the heart you think it's God talking from the heart but it's a lot of other crazy talk there's a lot of crazy talk in my mind on a regular basis real crazy real chaotic real frustrated and at times I got to tell me to do it now that's crazy talking that's the crazy loop talking cuz that's what I get from that settle the Mind first then that's the beginning of prayer Silence of the heart
 by the way that she sang it if you read the kind of like literally the the way that she's praising so God speaks in the sound so hard it is almost sounds like he doesn't speak when the heart's not silent right which might not mean that he's not speaking with just that we're not hearing right and so then she said so listening as it began prayer
 so what does that mean that before we sit down to pray in a people pray that they generally pray with concerns about their circumstances
and it's saying that you have to listen first
 and I guess listening means you do that which you don't normally do which is you actually slow down right like normally were just constantly in a state of trying to find whether it's comforter sets for dealing with responsibilities that we feel a part of part of the Necessities that we have to take care of but the ideas that goes you're going to hear that voice of first thing you have to do is actually cut out time in your day to listen and if you just Amelie set sit there and do it is going to be like why don't hear anything right it's going to like
 I can take some time to go into that space she uses work hard not even mind sure
 try to try to go into that and see what am I what am I not hearing normally
 about my life about my behavior about what's important what's not important what is it that I'm not hearing that I meant to hear that I could create some space forever some
silence for the heart and before I begin to pray for anything before I even know what to approach got about right maybe I should try it is kind of wondering how much I do it
 you don't know right now so you got when you do have these things like I told me to do it it's always good to go to a devotee that you trust and said no God seems like is this what do you think we have this whole thing like she got what we say be careful. That got you will give a crap I would say he had a nice I forget exactly rephrase it is that Target or maybe Target up I think it said that we that we hear from God within the heart and internally from God from within and then
confirmed by the spiritual Master without is that is that how it was done about right
 he got his baby because praising more precisely the way that he did cuz she's going with this
 so it's it's it's in within that instruction the ideas don't just depend on your own thoughts of what God is saying that maybe that might attract as in your mind that is speaking anything speaking we're saying that today I think your loss could speak agree could speak your anxiety could speak to you and we could mistake that for God don't do that anyway I like that for Mother Teresa at work said we're going to hear quite a bit about part of my life on the show yeah you would have to create some silence in your heart for her till I speak no more challenging
how did some people in the other mothers are probably a lot of mothers there to have want to find out who's the top mother we don't want one of the bottom of the great to have
 alright alright what's going on with you I just remember anything you want to hear about today Lord jagannath old beautiful Temple beautiful gorgeous deities
 you know I just appreciate the day because I'm just loving being with you I'm loving being with all the everybody is here and you know it really doesn't like it rained you know but like we didn't care if we got a little wet when it you know we ate and sort of Peace then sprinkled lightly and by the time you're done with the prashad and the poor sod was incredible The Price Choppers really incredible
and that's if that's a beautiful off art beautiful is art as a science and it's a beautiful devotional offering the way that they the concept of Consciousness that goes into those meals that they prepare 64 preparations chapter of the Lord everyday
 and we get to have to reserve it we reserved it way in advance are taking a few months ago and you know it all so it's really just fun like sometimes I'll have a relationship with people like Moses or David Charles Wilson or Katherine back in America and I'm thinking in my mind I was thinking oh man I can't wait to take these people to India someday I was drunk like that and then they're here with me and it felt great to get to go to jogging to Temple I think like that like I remember going there the first time in 1991 and now its like before Maya was born probably write Maya
yeah she has she's not yeah no way over there before you were born in this you're born in this Millennia not last Millennium so anyway so I remember going there for the first time ever being taken there and I remember eating there and I remember being in like jumping up and down before that. He said to see other people and take them there for the first time it creates a lot of joy for me and and have them experience that as well how about that tomato chutney there was a lot of stuff that did run out but it was okay because of the different taste you got when we know we got to serve out when it was a nice thing to do I really like I don't really like this thing of you and meet you in the store about it's just my way should be the seniors should always serve out you know others can volunteer and you can make it I think that's our thing he didn't make that about
 okay
 a beautiful beautiful day and then it started pouring rain that it started pouring rain and put we don't deserve the shelter
Singing Singing in the Rain
 all right are you ready to get into the Rhine on the mosquito bite in the Stream on music on quest one should offer a speculum agencies to the Supreme Lord the Ryan to shoot most human being mean to other stars Swati the goddess of learning and you should be off today of the author now stop raised to bother you soon in classes on the bottom with Tom and the rendering service De Pere devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated love you service of the Supreme Lord whose Praises songs will be established as in a revocable fact
Jack's Auto Middletown PA the darkness of my teachers are opening my eyes that the torch out of knowledge after obeisances of the lotus feet
 reading for the Shema Bible time
 we're out at the Canter 739
 so what what's happening now we got story-within-a-story now where we actually went down to stage level 4
 we dug in deep well anyway we're in a story-within-a-story within the story and it's a good maybe even within one more because so he ran across to put the great demonic figure was consoling his family about the death of his brother ever dream that you're dreaming
 I'm not sure
yeah that would ever have a dream that your squirrely so but he was speaking to them the same Vedic knowledge that the sages speak yeah so he definitely had some insight yeah and then to further that that message he began to to tell the story so we're in stores within stores within stores in that story was about how ya Mirage
 and when there was a death of a king on forgetting what his name was all his wives are out there pounding their chest and crying and just hanging out to the dead body and remember you yesterday I barely remember that hang around here and so it so they are all lamenting and crying and then yamaarashi the god of death comes disguised as a young boy yes and it becomes the first of his comes out of his mouth is no sound
Politically Incorrect but maybe it's cuz he's a mini took the form is a boy just so they could speak in such a direct way of pushing it a little thing like don't be so sentimental me they were women you know he was man he would have said him in a week meant by the phrase oh wimpy men something like that maybe he came as a boy because it's sort of catches people off-guard and honorable he's available at it maybe a week or maybe somehow just makes the message
 I don't know what just disarmed them in a certain way maybe anyway they're all they're all just freaking out all the although the wives of freaking out and now y'all mirages speak into them will direct about the nature that the soul about how the soul is not the body is not the mind excetera
something Divine something about okay here it comes ready and there's the set here's the statement oh weak women only by the will of the Supreme personality of godhead was never diminished is the entire world created maintained and again annihilated this is the verdict of all Vedic knowledge you're trying to catch you put on the story of Vedic knowledge this material creation consisting of the moving and non-moving is exactly like his plaything being the Supreme Lord he is completely competent to destroy and protect so the message right off the bat is although your suffering right now due to your attachments do do the world not moving the way that you wanted to move your he's saying that understand that it's all moving
 as the will of God right is it just
try to look at it in a different way I know you're suffering I know you're grieving
 I am Aces also indicating that they're weak right but he sent try to understand that this is moving according to a plan and plan this way Beyond you you say Zachary in them to rise to a higher level of understanding
 you said something today that got me thinking really I said something profound yeah always ready to see what I don't like hell right now and it was related to this but it was real, sometimes one loses his money on a public Street this is where everyone can see it and yet his money is protected by Destiny and not seen by others man I tell you I can scroll up on this one for like losing something publicly but they having it there the next day it was sometime
last year I was really going through a lot in life in general and then and then and then and then I had it you know sometimes like when I take my deed bag out and I'm done Channing I just kind of talked it into my life I just got talking into my waist you know and I then I got an a bicycle and I was riding around I was in Washington Square Park at Red Cross Saint Marks Place and what's Tompkins Square Park do a little circumambulation I realized
 watch are the area I love these bees are from Silver talk to Marla Wright Buick beautiful set of bees that I really put my heart into chatting on these beads in that was kind of like it just really sucks cuz I was just going through so much of that time I was just like that's the last thing I want to see who this was. I thought I have to retrace my steps I Road
bike all the way back across town all the wall around the park looking ever and I just know I'm never going to find those never going to find and then I and then I just kind of like almost tearing up you know and I said anyway I just go back one more time and this is going back I saw them lying in the middle of the street and st. marks LOL so this is something like that we should have a whole day where people tell stories about how they lost something but found it right now yeah, I just talked about that
 where are we sometimes someone loses his money on Lewis Street in a public Street where everyone can see it and get his money is protected by Destiny and not seen by others are protected by Destiny I feel and who lost it gets it back now listening I was going to flip it on the other hand if the Lord does not give protection even money maintained very securely at home is lost okay
do I have a girlfriend
 who criminals came into the house duct tape the father tied up the mother and it did they didn't have enough didn't have enough duct tape for her it was in the safe hidden in a safe okay they was an inside job I don't know I don't know they never caught him I don't think all right but my point is ya lose everything and you don't get it back to you know we can see where he's driving here we tend to move around the world thinking all this happened because of my effort right but he saying sometimes there's no effort you have the money is lying right out there in the public anyone can see it and pick it up Nobody Does it sometimes used to cure that you've made all this after you've invested you put in you know serious intention
Google videos cameras on your door security systems and you still see him do you lose it all okay so so I wish you play the shell is it kind of show in Japan and it was like one of those crazy and I saw what's $100 in yen I think like 10,000 Yen or thousand whatever it was falling out of his pocket rolling down his leg as he stays out of it and it rolled down his like a note a note bill and it landed right on my foot and he's disappeared into the crowd the ocean and I just a place to grab it I threw it at my Brody and then and I didn't even try like did someone just
yeah yeah so fast it was really really fast to put it in your own pocket because I thought you thought that would look bad if you go I guess that's not a good story that was God's plan to just a question I literally rolled into nothing but I'm not going to stop the whole song to someone lost a hundred bucks and I was like a dollar or something yeah of course you rationalize it very well
greatest amount of money or found I don't know I mean maybe some that I drove a couple hundred bucks
 okay, okay but let's continue with this so so sometimes you have it secured in your home and still it's lost continue right there gives one protection even though one is not even if one has no protector and is in the jungle one remains alive where is a person well protected at home by relatives and other and other sometimes dies no one being able to protect it so what's the message the message is here is a rocket Krishna murari Ki murli Krishna rocket K if Kristen wants to save you know he'll kill you if he wants to kill you
 no one can harm you and I think no matter what we do for protection we can
yeah it was a Kennedy get shot was an inside job anyway he was completely protected and and then he was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth and then yeah something like that if someone is whatever walking through a ghetto where is really dangerous and they're completely unprotected completely protected for some reason there or in the middle of a battle or in the middle of a battle or do you hear those stories about those people that survived World War Two and then they go home to get drunk they fall in a puddle and they drown in the puddle or hear the story about a baby ever hear this was a babies fall out of a moving car on the highway at Lee fine nothing wrong you know about a baby I'm not sure if the baby's arm or bouncy you know
 you don't have to
deeper into that idea is that
 it's not that the message is don't try right it's not that the met you know what the gift is going to 18 chapter 8 verse using the second chapter but I'm thinking of the factors of action that's one thing I was thinking of where is like you have the right to perform your prescribed do to you you really even says the right as you your ID card after you had your qualification Arjuna there for your obligation is action in this world not the renunciation of action for him it was to be a warrior right so so you have the obligation to work in this world but you're not entitled to the fruits of that work never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities that's interesting right it's like I think that's against the way we think to say that again never ever see yourself to be the cause of the
call tevere activities and at the same time here now and I think I came here because I chose to come here so can I say that's not true according to your statement that's not true it's today I just you're not the ultimate cause okay there's one factor that someone might desire to go there but without that being facilitated by the part of Mama it won't happen sometimes things. Sometimes we make a plan to go somewhere and such a tragedy happens we get Mist directed something to get called back for something we can't go so is his never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your test and then still
 never be tested not doing your duty do do do you're supposed to do but don't expect that there will be the result that your expectation is going to and it's and it's saying it's not saying don't put in the effort it's not saying all the money you're not the cause well that's the case then why should I watch the trivia right now
Spiritual Beings and kind and loving and have character
 but he's got understand there's other factors going to be all the rage in the kids to that they're going to come out don't be too attached you never know how accurate is going to come out now we know how she's coming out but the fact is you got to do your best to your duty as the parent and the kids have their own Pap ultimately as well so yeah mirages is saying don't try to secure money just don't leave it in the middle of street but he's he's sharing this to show that there are other factors that everything isn't dependent on her effort that would you put in the effort But ultimately there is a planet that's greater than our effort you know it's our responsibility to put in the right after it in the right way prioritize things correctly and insured by putting in a full effort but he's telling these ladies right now there's a Yamaha just telling these ladies the fact that your husband died here
I meant about our forever but this is part of a plan you know this is this is been changed ultimately what's has happened whether it's wonderful or horrible it's been sanctioned by God now respond in that Consciousness right responding that Consciousness and see where that takes you just as a householder other different from the identity of his house thanks his household identical with him okay see what you do you're like Mary drag it up so I'm right now on and I'm I'm trying to think ahead those work against each other every condition still receives a different type of body according to his work and when the engagement is finished the body is finished so going to work means that's her, right you put in a certain actions you get certain reactions you get a body of yours like I did something to get this every
every little
 navigation solve the different type of body according to his work and with this engagement is finished the body is finished although the spirit Soul situated in a subtle and when the engagement is finished the body is finished about his feelings so he's telling this body karmically finish it was meant to say it was it was that came to a tent you know about the spirits so situated in subtle and gross material bodies in different forms of life is not bound by them free is always understood to be completely different from the manifested body in your husband didn't die so hard to really deeply grass
I can superficially grasp it but you're really grasp that means I would be fearless and I would never look in the mirror again
 I know I mean
 never look in the mirror meaning looks like you could do it that way or you might just say it it's not me but it should look good for the service that I do for the for my purpose but you know this is remind me the question that was asked of you today by Laura about
 isn't it spiritual bypassing Air Supply passing if we're talking about what
 it had to do with grief I think right
 I mostly read Greg how to emotionally regulate but about oh yeah about some of these hole the story yesterday about a devotee who said his wife
 who is
loved him like just one day said I'm not into the right religion this is holding the cult she became like a like a what he called it a very fanatical Christian took her three children in the youngest like six months years old okay hand and said I'm gone and so you just supposed to respond by saying that's okay yeah and this was the thing you said I said something profound know that was something else okay digging for that this may have been it yeah I think this was it you responded very well to that question I think and but I forgetting what you said that I said are you going to feel those emotions
 you mentioned that yeah that's natural that you feel is not that you're meant to be like some even still awake or even like some kind of cold you know you called to it all
 and the truth is
spiritual bypassing is a spiritual reality also is a spiritual reality that we Are Spiritual Beings and we're not going to no one's going to fake make the emotions like of lamentation but would you apply wisdom to Los wisdom of the Betrayal wisdom to death wisdom to miss losing your fortune than you grow that you grow from it apply to it you don't grow in bitterness revenge spite hatred resentment that video we're getting and then I was thinking about I might wish I was coming turbo scenarios about revenge never be there for that I think you said time I turn my singing this when when you were saying that
 I was also thinking of how people talk about spiritual bypass and that spiritual bypassing was used in its original context I think like in other words rather
I'm going with in and dealing with some good nowadays when they say Spirit investment is a lot of times it's about like you haven't become a spiritual activists on this particular political issue that was more about how the term was originally applied which is right am I willing to do the internal work right now and face challenging things in life where I might just try to I am I trying to avoid them in the guise of spirituality you're not agreeing with my political cause and you're spiritually bypass that's what they have them ordered so I appreciate what you said and still and still like friends since I've seen you respond to different people in different ways about the same thing in different ways because the point is is that we are meant to grow and someone that's deeply spiritually inside what can kind of understand the capacity of the person the emotional capacity the person right how much truth
are they ready to imbibe because like friend since I've seen sometimes people come to him and
 unload about what they're going through let's say like within spiritual circles within a spiritual Society their disappointments and Ed him respond with nothing but sympathy sympathy for right and then other times I've seen someone come through with the exact same kind of thing
 and he wouldn't tolerate it for second light in other words he was in and you know the person said all we've suffered so much and we've gone through this and then I was just like you know what I'm not hearing that in order to to indicate you know we can sit there and wallow in that forever right but or we could or we or we could put it in a New Perspective and say that's the nature of this world that that that that that these things happen I'm not going to let negative thoughts
over, now I'm going to start to think positive in and start to act positive based on that and that way we turn the whole situation around I remember once there was a really negative kind of scene are honest with his kind of getting called into it and I was a little worried about it you know what I was going to ask a little bit like you know I said Nora as you know this a lot of negative energy over there and he said and he said well
 my experience is that the only way to overcome the negative energy is to bring forth a lot of positive energy and and so in one sense easily said it happened while he plays you know you always bring that positive energy but but my point is
 the real knowledge real truth real spiritual knowledge began however you want to call it it actually is the answer and ultimately it is the answer another question is how much of the medicine can a particular person take out of her
but I'm sure that's that's the that's the expertise but that's what makes a great but if you're never going to speak the truth then no one's going to get dinner then no one's ever going to get better Ryan. You're always be angry at life or at the others are at the situation or at the potluck this cruel life is so little boy La Mirage here he's going he's kind of common with the message right here, call him, he's coming with the mess it sounds like it might be more appropriate to say oh you're really going through a lot right now but he's not he's he's chosen to kind of come straight forward with like this this message and it's not spiritual bypassing it's like it's dealing with the enemies of courage in them to step up and deal with it hey and he's giving it and he's he's speaking he's taking the time to to provide the analogies and the thought it took to understand that
you could lament about this forever maybe he shouldn't have fought maybe he should have thought differently maybe you noticed don't this battle should never happen excetera excetera sir but ultimately he saying there's a plan of God in this now you going to are you going to try to ignore that you can try to bypass that are you going to learn how to work with that understanding through that and understand how we're all incredibly vulnerable at every moments right no matter what kind of precautions
 Murray this is a household just as a householder other different from the identity of his house thinks his house to be identical with him right now and I got to get indoor pool like you get a house you really get into the house as your identity you can the condo especially when you purchase it you feel like there's it's more you almost an apartment it's a big thing of it it's a it's the the three
attaches right your house family you're well those fleets are their biggest knots of the heart that ties to this body
 Jess is a household other different from the identity of his house thanks his house to be identical with him right someone comes over I like your house if I don't like you at all about me I like you I don't like you then
 just like it hurts if someone doesn't like your house off of course and that's a little ball Yama is saying that just as a householder executed
it's adorable that the name of the deity that installed in a yoga is ROM law of that horrible imagine that guy is so lucky you made that Daddy carbide Daddy he says he said I feel when they asked me to carve is Dee Dee on the most fortunate man in the universe
 yeah you thinking right siding
 just as a household or all the different from his identity of his house thanks is house to be identical with him so the condition Soul due to ignorance accepts the body to be M self right now. Wait I'm getting skinny or whatever growing hair on my ears whatever it is it's like it's not you
 this body is obtained through a combination of portions of earth water fire chai
hi
 and when the earth and water and fire transformed in the course of time the body is vanquished just like we saw that body burned yesterday disturbing about that body the arm the arm sticking up sort of like
 because I like awkward Lee like this and just the bone was left in the hand and
 because I feel like it was waving to us
 you know make sure when I'm dead when it my on my deathbed by my sudden you can't do that the rigor mortis sets in and quick just going to wait down my Rigamortis arm I don't want to be put in the Flames of my arm sticking and they don't you can't wait then Don you got to crack them at that point I know what you got planned
 I'm dead anyway you sure like
don't laugh at me your next I wasn't laughing I was feeling was feeling for you
 I think he finished his first hit heavy I don't think so. To talk about this body is obtained this body is a
 this party is obtained through a combination of portions of earth and water and fire and chai I said that the soul has nothing to do with this creation and dissolution of the body
 next analogy next analogy Aspire of a situated in Wood right there's fire and wood is perceived to be different from the wood yes
 as are all those situated within the mouth and nostrils is perceived to be separate and as the sky although all-pervading never mixes with anything
 so the living entity although now in caves within a matter right here in cage with
material body
 of which it is the source it will it is separate from its OK Google stuff
 more what you say more chocolate this is the weather on this is the best job I've ever had, so I'm about to say something but I can poop and forgot cuz you got so excited
 oh yeah fire with Inwood okay he's giving is not out of imagine if we study the comps are there to say like each one of these has a different meaning right Fire Within wood are within the mouth and nostrils or things mixing or not hopefully being with in the sky but not mixing with this guy saying that we are within the body we don't mix with the body were always
and I think it's interesting how maybe in the culture that this comes from
 like I don't think as Americans we grew up seeing others fire in the wood even though they're clearly is right it's like we think the would like Fire gets put on the top of the water so you're like the fire is like a place where what is like a place where you start the fire on top of it at one of the thugs trying to extract it through a process so so when they use this analogy thing is to a mind at things this way right now we know there's fire in that wooden we don't think of the fire is being the wood we think of the fire has been within the wood right so we don't think of the self as being a body we think of the self is being within the body sure trapped in a body that's what's going on here
 imagine how pretty you were going to feel when we're out of the body
carrying a heavy backpack around
