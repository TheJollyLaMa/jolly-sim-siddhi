call yamo Bhagavad
 live from Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City this is was in the sages today I'm your host cuz stupid ass and our friends rubbing off is taking the day off right now that's what you doing with this time he's going to go for a bike ride yeah we're going out this week because that sometimes I decided after doing tons of interviews were both trying to interview some
I'm pulling the person in opposite directions that it might be good if Just One of Us interview people until we're kind of going back and forth and today I have the great Fortune of interviewing Our Guest today crippled boy. So we'll bring out in a minute but before we do that mareth you have any announcements today I do if I care cover group meetings today at 1 and 7:30 eastern time and also is messages or hold their annual fall Retreat October 11th through 13th appear at Super Soul Farm in Upstate New York yeah it's a great time so go to stages.com to register magic is that at that time of year in Upstate New York is very beautiful with all the leaves are changing
 so what we saw was a nice time to get together I also want to mention again yesterday we opened up our signups for the next session of sage groups which runs from September through December you know that that
. already we open it up at 9 a.m. so less than twenty-four hours ago yesterday
 and 64% of the slots are filled there's about 300 slots and 64% of the field so again if you want and you know what we do is look as we get closer to the
 to like them all being full we are responsive to like how I couldn't find a time that works for me or something like that then we'll we'll try to adjust so but for now if you want to want to get in the group of your choice the sooner you get in the better cuz already it's it's 2/3.
 Okay so what for that if you want to sign up for sage group life chanted what you know I talked to poop and white purple about this because he takes a lot of interests and is very experienced in small groups the dining table talk about that today.
dynamics of small groups for Spiritual practice and that's what you know this age group is really off for that there's a certain Dynamic that takes place in a small group you meet once a week online and a transformative you know it's so try to get in a group and again soon as you sign up for dinner and to do that one goes to wisdom of the ages., and then and then you get like a whole layout of all the different age group leaders unique group of people wonderful people and as well as the different times and some of the groups have themes right like that it's not that the group only talks about this thing but it's a grouping of people from a SIM with a similar interests or similar backgrounds there's lady women's groups men's groups
 there's a group so I think this parent to do the parenting group I believe there's even a hardcore group and some other things out there that sometimes it's nice to meet a group of people
how to share something similar to you most of the groups are just kind of wide open just you know how accepting all the types of people so please consider that as a next step for someone I've admired for so long ago as a disciple of show Pro pod I hope we first met in England in 1975
 he believes that a dynamic spiritual movement can be built through the formation of small groups and this belief has resulted in his life as a traveling teacher of Krishna bhakti perfect for since the 70s he's been moving around especially Great Britain and stopping off in and just you know coming into people's homes in meeting with people and tell him when he's not visiting community members in their homes or speaking of gatherings he writes and that's another thing I want to talk but he has a brand new book out
the group and disciple book and the companion volume 164 questions to ask before initiation have both been well received other books include a violation of a catechism will afford a spiritual life the small groups handbook for 100 autumns one life and a brand new book that's actually not quite out yet but Bill will be released at the end of this month causing a hormone which we want to discuss today grab my purple welcome to whisman to say welcome back to his messages
 good morning everyone and you know that we didn't mention one of your greatest accomplishments as the father Genovese Harrison just and in other wonderful children as well all equally talented and spiritually dynamic
 I don't know how you do it
 but you did it over and over
you're in Scotland right now
 I'm here in Bonnie Scotland the sun is shining I'm at the top of a hill
 sky is blue what are you up in Scotland doing your know you normally live in England just north of London or near the but you got the matter correct
 yeah it's about 300 miles to the south of separate nation out of four nations of the United Kingdom that we can't figure that out okay Great Britain United Kingdom England whole thing is I don't think a lot of you people can figure it out and let their checking in with me this morning
do you have like a special little vehicle you're traveling around with her to send ordinary car and like to travel that way to Why Don't We Begin by talking about your brand new book which is published by a penguin it's a book where you're at answering questions I wanted to just read this just this real short description on the back of the book it says for 50 years crippled boy dice has taught the spiritual culture Sonata Dharma all over the world putting together the questions and doubts he's encountered over the decades he presents this hand booked that readers can turn to anytime
 on their spiritual journey so could you tell us you know what the Sonata in Dharma mean and ends in tell us a bit about the book
 this book was some
it's been published by penguin India so it's an awesome time there was a change of title to suit the Indian market for him in the woods not on Dharma sometimes emotions under the political situation in India Rising tide and interest in in India spiritual tradition with amongst the use in India is it to be true because we've had a few times with the Narendra Modi who's the protagonist, as the leader
 who's trying to use of India to return to the spiritual roots and so that's why it's not on a popular British Open
people more secular State many people believe that a secular State can be there but with the structural route
 so soon. And armor the title name Sonata maintenance Eternal do that with you and I know that he knows the way that I'm no physician extension position so that term it's a not Dharma how's it been used traditional in your house it understood
 it's been used to say about tradition. If you could say it's the state of the Soul
 Dharma means Eternal pop soul
 separate from your racial identity your political identity your family. What are you what are you doing
yeah just an option I see channel on to gain true happiness pain policies in our environment to experience the essence of one virtual being it any no speaking of the interest of rising interest of this I'm so happy to see you with a book published by penguin in India because past few years now when you go into a bookstore in India
 you know like how bookstore put some books right up front that you see you soon as you walk in the door and it seems nowadays when you walk into a bookstore and in DC it's all are re Krishna devotees even you know. We're just riding our Swami's disciples you know you see Jay Shetty choreographer boo Super Bowl loss and it's like well these are all people I know and so looking forward to seeing your book out right up there with her
 weather
do you know the airport if not now then at the end of the month at a book stores in the airport's it was a trusted logo for a good raid simple read the drill down into subject but not too complicated and mother were here to see you have Anna is looking down. Could you just share a bit about the book for our for our listeners if they might find it interesting and what topics are covered
 if I look at that it's not great cover too bright orange goes with penguin logo over the years I have noticed that people ask many questions and some of them are
 some of the questions that
mosque
 I'm so we picked up on those questions we compiled 300 questions and gave
 short with their answers to them and put it all in the phone with about 35,000 which is what I was looking for nothing too long nothing too deep with something which should be easy to Sally's Market that's what we've come up with so many questions, questions that you come across in your service and typical areas that are brought up well in the foundational philosophical things is practices of spirituality meditation connections between Hinduism
there is some
 what I call the Protestant questions like my mother was
 my mother was religious but she's out of town so what what do you say to that I do why should I allow Google to tell me what to do I don't want to join I want to be spiritual but I don't join anything at the temple all about what is ritual.
 Questions like that. To do with retro sometimes you just I think to get to the essence you want as you can find the essence through those kind of questions and also sometimes you just got to you just got to deal with a lot of topics first kind of like
 handle a lot of the confusing elements before you get down to the route to the route
the book so they can just say look book Back to Basics are there any areas in the book any questions that are especially meaningful to you or dear to you in some way
 well obviously I want to share the fact that you that she but you have to get through a lot of questions about basic spirituality before coming to that I think gum
 to the western region many many people are interested in this life not being the only one possibility previous lives and future lives as real eye-opening ungodly one chapter
 I think that's a
 they laid Muhammad why does Mantra meditation
what is meditation it was Krishna what is Christian
 can I change can I recite the Mantra original but I just want things like that and
 in answering these questions I so I know it's something that you must have refined over the years
 perhaps the same question that you would have heard in the 70s and 80s you may be answering a different way now maybe partially because of times have changed or maybe because you've refined your way of communicating
 a death watch the movie Groundhog Day I have watched everyone says you have any questions just smooth and 16th and Loomis
satisfying for questioning over 50 years same questions question often don't okay
 I find this you have to establish an emotional connectivity between you is always a question behind the question
 what do you mean by that well people speak that they want to sleep like me because you don't want to install you okay so they asked a question you have to be able to read between the lines to see what what is the real question, my mother was religious but she died of cancer
 the stable behind that I'm really in pain now can you do anything for me you speak can you speak to my pain and so on so that you would get with big directly to that
so it's just a question. I think trying to develop emotional sensitivity I'm trying to ask the same thing is the real question behind the question that's really great and then some questions they come and we hear a lot of inquiries submissive
 but one of the questions that I'm going to go get some
 why do I have to ask respectful question you've done nothing to earn my respect that's one of the questions I was about to say that perhaps the British are are more polite than the Americans but I don't know after that I'm going to stay here we wouldn't we wouldn't have to interpret like what's the pain behind the question they would just in America there's, so I'm in pain
but you know them in your sharing this it's actually making me very eager to to read your responses that the take you know this this something special about a book is that it's is taking a whole hopefully a great mind and Distilling the thought down into you know
 who is most essential Community you know communicative thoughts and I think this is double-boiled because you know one it's is pulled down over your years to where it is now in your head and then it's pouring down from your head on to the printed page where it's like you really got the most essential questions in what I Stacey we didn't we didn't feel for the question which were recorded as they came in to us we aren't people ask questions
icing and these are recorded conversations or written questions about him. And we will resolve the wait time between 164 questions to ask before I miss you.
 He's a genuine question should have come to me over 10 years about you know where is a disciple of area caution questions real questions real Oz
 bother you know why I'm so as you've been refining again with fifty or so years of experience of of I don't know what the best way to be ministering to people or sharing with people agree with the philosophy of ancient India of books like the Bhagavad Gita and so on you been refining your the way that you answer the questions but I suppose you've
remember finding the way that you assist people in practicing bhakti and it's you know you speak a lot about the the power and the need for small groups I guess as opposed to larger groups can you speak to me a bit about how you've come to this conviction and your experiences over the years that led you to it
 yeah I mean two ways I've seen it work myself I've seen the
 you know when people take up a spiritual they actually required to add something onto their life
 the business of writing something onto you like we just met you
 you know you are a culture that something that you gravitated towards often its transformative but it's often demanding
Anna and any type of personal changes takes time and effort
 and you get out of it what you put into it so it only supports for their weight watching whether it's a sports challenge
 50 mile hike whatever it is you trying to do whatever challenges shaken up
 it's best done with the support lets other people who are
 in the same line what happens to the mutual support you can get a difficult thing.
 But then when the group continues you have an emotional connectivity between the members of the group
 social scientists have said that you know the best size for group is small that they think they have
smoke effect change in your life support other people while I support you
 you know I do believe that that's all the more true in our current age of social media and
 because it seems to me like nowadays even just to like say read a book A lot of people need to join a book club are there never actually going to get it done it's like I'll have that books it and I'll go I'll buy the book I have it sitting there but I'll have trouble picking it up and reading it in the end and putting down my phone and putting down my computer and stop scrolling through through things with my mind is so distracted when I pick up the book and start to read and I have a hard time keeping the focus there and if I have a support group and I know that at the end of the week I'm going to be meeting with them and discussing what I read then if it provides the
the motivation that I need to just even do something as simple as reading a book what does accountability that can exert an engine pressure that sometimes I'm well I don't see that working
 you know the other groups that we mentioned suddenly spiritual and it doesn't seem to be affected by
 geographical distance you know post post covid World connected by now and it seems to be at least 80% 80% as good as being in the same room as someone
 so when your travels throughout Great Britain you establish small groups that meet regularly
yeah and bring me up around a hundred. OK Google. Like one and every town the focus of the group might be here chilling if they come together physically but is usually care John discussion of Buckaroo pizza and socializing making friends and so that's really the entire entirety of the culture time does fidelis in Portuguese
 when they come together in groups that is the community meeting together
 so beyond the accountability that we spoke about his support in that sense
are there other types of support or other essential facets of the small group dynamic that are become important
 if they want to find that tribe you want to find people who are like them
 ages enforcement no wheels to find that tone you know when I was younger I could form a group of 20 year olds and now no trying to your office interested in meeting part of that group
 there is sometimes the pain bracket what people are going through and of course in some areas you talking about to Recovery Group that I own experience good things for that
does people in other sectors of a feather flock together soon so people who have the same experiences who are the same age and make the same language
 look up. Supposed to be on the same level of enquiry some people like spiritual socializing some people like more meditative session some people may just be kirtan no discussion. That's what they want so they become a good day and they bring out that where they put on some kind of whip cream or something on them or slotted cream
actually I'm not but I just heard about them well some people that buy hearing some people there and then me to her I got the advantage cuz she gently on American soil you know okay you know part of the elite back
 when they transform in their lives they go through challenges in adopting there
 the time the schedule is the work-life schedule to spiritual practices at home
 they may face challenges with family members question is
 my partner is interested in all this kind of thing that I'm not
 you know
yeah yeah that's very, very,
 I'm so if they can be in a room with others they can talk about the challenges and discuss somebody what do you do when he says this how do you behave when she says that I thought we have to do this but am I wrong about that so all of that is best discussed by people who've gone through the same struggle sure I want to discuss something I'm more with you but good before I go there or kind of leading into that what I found to the feedback that I've get from this age groups that are in our wisdom of the sages small groups
 is that
 you could potentially go to a large Temple or a temple for years even decades
 and perhaps you know of course it depends on the place and the people there but you might never get the feeling
that I can openly share
 what I'm going through or ask questions questions that might be
 what's the word I'm looking for I don't sensitive you know personal that might be essential for you to ask and it is it may be an essential place for you to inquire you may not feel comfortable or welcome to who's at those kind of questions you know you walk in and there's a certain form at you know there's a class with the speaker and then there's a few minutes for questions at the end it's a big public Arena
 you don't know if the questions are bully well-received or if you know you can really even fully ask them you might go
 many many years without it feeling free to ask what you need to do what you need to share said he'll see their own question then
how do you say I always wanted to ask that I didn't want to look stupid right yeah you know the Chinese have a saying you know that the ask a question you'll be regarded as stupid for 1 hour
 don't I don't I don't ask a question you'll be foolish like your eyes one great Catholic priest and Scholar he was examining the process about the yoga and he said that your community has everything you have meditation University morning rising yoga you know you said you have to you don't have a box if you don't have a sacred spiritual place we can go and you can say anything you like and you won't be questioned or either you or
unfavorably is confidential confidential but I don't know if it ever felt to welcome me you don't know if we need to save space really stood out like insane amount of materials go through this huge amount of changes to your belief structure to go to Somerset.
 I can accept this but I really can't go with us what do I do I don't want to be tonight I don't want to be
grateful cuz it got me so much I don't want to be rude cuz the nice people but I just, so you need someone to be with the same yeah yeah yeah I also feel like that I would imagine many questions that one may have
 that you want May fear that could be interpreted as challenging or disrespectful to but they really need to be asked
 yeah I think you have to be prepared to ask Lee quote unquote challenging or disrespectful questions have I asked you those questions and receiving answers maybe the person is answering the Chiefs respect because how to gain respect this by politely responding to questions which may be challenging secret of the few years ago
familiar familiar familiar what it was we need to we need to preach the message might need to preach the gospel but it has to be done we allow people to ask the difficult questions challenging disrespectful questions out right into it and questions special tradition that we can all people to do that so it was a talk followed by a quick 5 session in which you lost any questions you wanted
 I need to be disrespectful and the person would likely answer so one another your respect automatically
 and so they
 I should have a lot of people into that phone because if you can find that very hard to work for them because it was it was nice
so the other thing is very important relationship he's really he's really nice guy and I've asked some questions so I'm not going to this particular Retreat Center on a shirt or a pilgrimage place or India I'm going to be with good stripper cuz I know him he knows me and I know I can talk to him and you listen
 if you have that relationship with someone it works you know when it is hard to make friends nowadays again because of the I believe it has a lot to do with our computerized World in our working far from home being sent you know being alienated from family were feeling alienated from one another does the forms that we used to exist in where we would naturally make friends don't seem to be quite the same anymore
I know people that are practicing bought you that have come to Retreats of ours that you know and then I say you know I'll ask them you do you have some friends you know that are about to Yogi's that you know you're kind that you know you come maybe you come to the Barclay Center regularly but do you have friends there and they say no I don't and I end end Allen Carr's then like you know you just need to go up and say hey I want to be your friend cuz there's thinking the same thing you know and if part of the feedback I'm down from the stage cruises' you know this is the way I see group's work is that it's a weekly get together there's a generally there's an experienced spot to Yogi that's not teaching but facilitating the conversation and most commonly the conversation will be like some notes from a topic that was discussed in the previous week on the podcast
 so those you know those can create some
some Dynamic conversations and the forces of check-in and check-out you know hey how we do in the past week you know what was it like for you and he challenges any any positive things you want to share that you experienced but we also like to have weeks where we just kind of present questions that are meant for further bonding food for the getting to know one each other you know I would like what's your favorite you know who's your favorite kirtan leader and what was the best best for you ever been to or things like that that just get people sharing from their own heart and you know you go through 16 weeks with a group of seven or eight people
 I'm sharing like this and you develop you really get to know each other and yet you actually you know you know each other in a way that you might have never known someone just by going to Temple for years and years and you've made six or seven or eight friends and
then if you after that 16 weeks you know we take about a month break and then we start the next group and you do it again now you made another a friend's and then you do it again you made another now you got 24 friends in the world about the yoga that you couldn't reach. You know some of them will become close friends you know people in and then these people meet in person and it's very special you know when they get together person so that aspect is some is is been really really wonderful for the for the members
 beyond that I wanted to maybe maybe we're shifting format here we're going from my interview and you to my like getting your input on at some of the further developments you want to do we want to do here and I do that oh please. Well if you ever want to be at age group post I know you're busy man but you can't you could be one of the group leaders if you would love to have you or or maybe you could attend our meetings sometimes then sometimes you have meetings of the stage
l o u know what share out there and it would be great to have you including those meetings on hear your thoughts I'll sit quietly in the corner but I hear you know there's were trying to really create a network of care
 you know what network that you know if even if you're entirely isolated even you know you might be living in a city you even where there's a Temple and so I need might feel isolated but even let's say theoretically you are isolated you're you're out in the middle of nowhere there's no temples around you don't know anybody that practice is about to yoga
 just by coming on to the podcast and getting in touch with it and if it's resonating with you you feel like all these are true is this is this is a practice this is a spiritual practice I want to engage with I want to I want to make my own practice then Sage Grouse are there that did now you have your opportunity to ask questions to share to experience talk to you
with a group of people that's especially that's prasanga right especially that's for a sense of community
 we but we also want to have real more formalized learning real real training and learning and for that we were developing something we make all the sage Academy which would be courses that would you would take online we want to design them in a way where there really approachable and and really relevant but we want them to be you know even much of it to be tested you know that not not like super demanding hard test but tested in a way where we were making sure that we're getting the essence the most important points so we want that to be not again not not academically intimidating to anyone
 but effective that you actually learn you know you and you really learn what you need to learn when when you and I joined you and I got involved in Buckley will join a temple in you go through programmer
get trained in all this you get an immersion nowadays very few of the people that are becoming about to Yogi's are moving and two hash browns and they need to get this somehow so we want to try to provide that to that Academy then another thing we want to do and it at Academy hopefully even buy this fall we may begin to release the initial courses if not early next year so hopefully Adam we also want to do something that the kind of recognizes we we might call this like Sage care for instance and it recognizes that people practice bhakti yoga up until they run into some bump some hurdle something kind of at some point
 it becomes difficult or they get distracted in a particular way or they lose their hope and in some way or they get turned off by something that may even be a misunderstanding if we could through the sage was kind of survey those groups
and hear from them what are the most pressing issues or what what is it that you need some assistance with some help with in order for you to continue to go deeper into this practice do we have a list of about 25 things you know they may be like psychological like
 I struggle with depression and I've been practicing boxing for a year and a half now and I'm still struggling with depression so maybe this doesn't work for me or something on it may be practical I just don't have the time to do this practice you know you have to chance 16 rounds when you do this that's takes about 2 hours and I just don't have two hours free that's going to make this work for me you know or it may be practical in the sense like gum
 you know I have three kids and I don't have no idea what my responsibility is as a as a box of Yogi and terms of parenting am I supposed to make them chant every day am I
I am clueless as far as what to do here it may be like cultural like I've read these books and I've said some things you know about it maybe about gender roles or or some other you know attitudes cultural ideas that seem very foreign to me and I don't know if I can invest my mind and heart in them that maybe like a lot of different reasons you do a dictionary of course addiction is something that that we do already having you know what a nice program in place for the body recovery group but we would like to create a team that some a team that would combine people that are devotees and also professional counselors in different areas but also just devotees are good communicators that can help people kind of what you're doing in your book I think help people understand
 these things more clearly
questions clearly and in ways with that they'll be like all I didn't know that you didn't have to chance 16 rounds that you can still practice is so you know even if you're not or I never understood I never I never heard it explained that way and I'll makes more sense to me so it's okay if I can communicate while like that and that this team would just determine what are
 what's the best format to address this need like it may be that we just need to create a video where we explain these things that becomes part of an archive you know for the future of Me Maybe that we would say something even some some sensitive topic like let's say
 amongst like 300 Sage group members there were like 15 of them that had been less a sexually abused in some way and maybe they struggle with in different ways this is my karma is it my own fault that this happened to me or you know it's Kris created fear or resentment and anger in me that makes it hard for me
to believe in God fully or whatever it might be this group might say for this for these people were going to create a group that meets together once a month with a professional counselor in that area that's going to you know I work with these people you know and so whatever the format it might be that an essay just needs to be written or whatever it is they they would determine the best format to address that need and and just try to effectively help you know large groups of people pass through the the over the hurdles that may we may find on a path to practice potty
 I'm interested in your thoughts on that well I would support for that because it's real absolutely required generation of bhakti yoga practitioners in West
 Arizona
concerned with preserving the Legacy or establishing the foundational beliefs and ideas and told you in there on my twitch
 it's up to the Next Generation 00q to Taylor to bring about dealing with it the real challenges but I think it's an ideal and so the first generation and they were they did so much to establish the ideal we are to do and now the the Next Generation has to deal with the real so that we could come up to the idea that the real realize that this is what this is my real like to be eventually so that's why I can move forward because that's the tradition of the latest deal with people of all
 in all conditions is always a prescription
 is it like a doctor doctor can do before school
for your condition so you can spiritually moving forward so it's up to us to
 be the spiritual doctors in the future I think of course traditionally there's a guru there you know it in a practitioner's you know now and it's kind you know there's kind of a hurdle to get over because I may not be ready to to follow all the vows I need to be formally initiated by Guru and that may create a gap that I can't get across where I need help you know I need personalized personalized Taylor help but I'm not getting it because I haven't been able to make that full commitment that's needed for me to have that connection when you when you look for a person who's there
 spiritual guide
an encourager it's always one available who I do believe I've seen it so many times the number 11
 Allegacy holds up for representative
 sometimes I'm just coming from the most you know unexpected Mouse enough people can support that God speaks to people that will be able to help you poop
 so I guess it's the old you know the old story for I buy some orange juice
don't say that you don't know that one of the synagogue or something like that anyway I had a dream goddess told me so you trap I was looking at the other three and say we're on our way so I'm able to see him so they all start at 7 each other listening to each other through so much that but I'm new people want to join us if you see each other as the possible mouth bass
 with a possible crisis be possible answer to a question and often that opens up with Channel
 222 really really help you I've seen it work so many times
Collective Collective group within the group
 I I think that also you know something this kind of someone recently risen up
 in the awareness of rug and has proven myself is that we see you know cuz of course again both he and I like you when we got into bhakti so many decades ago we would move into Temple to be full immersion you get all the training that you needed and in that that progression in the path of bhakti from first there's some face I think these people around is something that this is making a lot of sense that this into something beautiful about this and sell it to the next stage with side of Sungha how you know where your associating with people that practice it here you're mixing with them and you're learning from them and be inspired by them being blessed by them
you come to the stage called Bhajan of kriya which means now you're meant to be guided on your practice you know you're meant to that comes with commitment and so when we hit that stage we had a guru and we had a group that not only knew you know that when ruggedness was initiated he was his group's first disciple okay when I was initiated my crew had hundreds of disciples but not thousands
 he knew me he knew my name he knew about my life he was there to instruct me and even if that was even if your group with someone you know distance physically still you're in a temple where they're playing people that were ready to give you ship show ready to give you instructions you know help you understand when to wake up want to go to sleep what books to read what books not to read you know how much did practices what is your service all that was given to in your spiritual life would just like take off but nowadays because
aren't you any of these temples which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but once they hit that stage where the faith reaches a certain point where they're ready for instruction in the ready to be you know I'm practice with commitment we feel we have to be really we really have to do what we can do to help people pass through that it and part of that may mean
 getting that getting that instruction from a person that you admire like a group but but without that. Without that at some level of commitment but maybe not that 16-round for principle level maybe that's a again and I deal that were working towards but I'm never going to get there if I can pass through this stage right now where I'm sorry I'm a I'm a single mother with 3 kids and a full-time job and I just don't see how I can chance 16 rounds that you know when they okay maybe you need to commit to let you know that kind of help we want to
if we can provide that written in a country like a network of care
