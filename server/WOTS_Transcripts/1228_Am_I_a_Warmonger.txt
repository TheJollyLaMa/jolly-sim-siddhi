 how are you doing I'm just great I had a great I really needed it too I just got a massage from that guy Rachmaninoff took me to another dimension

 we have a bacterial cover your meetings at 1 and 9:30 eastern time today Josh Jane is back this week with his Cult of Cain class for Patriot members and Sunday is honored posture yoga class
 craft and the showing time being
I'm going to greet the guests okay
 okay so we have a nugget
 this nuggets from Thomas Merton Trappist monk Trappist is that mean the trapped animals I doubt it will be a trap I have no idea what it means Trappist Monk
 Trappist monk or something what's going on those monks are doing maybe it was on a trapeze quite athletic Monk
 relating to or denoting a branch of the cistercian order of monks founded In 1664 and noted for an austere rule that includes remaining silent for much of the time
 it's got to do with traps
okay so this is a quote from Thomas instead of loving what you think is peace
 love other men and love God above all and instead of hating the people you think are warmongers if the appetites and the disorder in your own so which of the causes of War if you love peace then hate Injustice hate tyranny hate greed but hate these things in your cell
 not in another easy to hate the things that you thank you my shortcomings makes me seem like well I got my stuff together I would never do that
what do you this is one of these things where it's the microscopes now placed on me at all times and every one of our first episodes I think was entitled I think you said that the yogurts turning the microscope I want self
 it really is and how we interact with the world and how we change change the world it's a lot of self-reflection and
 yeah it is so little externals and so much internal stuff I found it interesting how he said
 instead of loving what you think is peace
 and it and I'm going to read you something cuz this is part of a longer hero
 he wrote is a book even dabbling into Merchant his little bit
I read a few paragraphs that came before this
 but when it's what he does is something I've seen in my own life to do like having a good fortune of having Association as some people that would like very deeply spiritual and very sincere but I think when we hear about something like peace and this what he's a show we think we know what peace means and what it looks like but we only approach on a superficial level one that doesn't challenge ourselves very deeply so like a person that deeply spiritual really it's just a question of challenging one's self tan deeper and deeper and deeper levels in most of us are hesitant to do that
 but sometimes like I've seen it like I've seen people speak about like creating Harmony
 or being tolerant and I've seen certain people do that on levels where most people would have rationalized the need for it away like I've taken this far enough but you actually never get to any kind of real
 life
changing our society changing levels of Depp's if you rationalize it away before you go very deep into it so this is what this is what
 Thomas Martin Roach
 and I found it very interesting he said if men really wanted peace if they really want which we all say we wanted so we really wanted if men really wanted peace they would sincerely ask God for it and he would give it to them
 why should I give the world a piece which it does not really desire the peace the world pretends to desire is really not peace at all
 okay what does he mean
 sister something in peace merely means the Liberty to exploit other people without fear of retaliation or indifference listen we're going to have peace
 two others
it means the freedom to Rob brothers without interruption
 to still others it means the Leisure to Devour the goods of the Earth
 without being compelled to interrupt their Pleasures to feed those when their greed is starving
 and others if we want peace we have to take things out of that going to take a deeper take a deeper really look at my look at my own life right he goes he goes on and they said into practically everybody
 P simply means the absence of any physical violence that might cast a shadow over our lives devoted to the satisfaction of their animal appetites for comfort and pleasure
 he says many men like these have asked God for what they thought was peace
 and wondered why their prayer was in the answers they could not understand that it actually was answers
God left them with what they desired or their idea of Peace was only another form of War
 the cold war is simply the normal consequence of our corruption piece they sent a policy of every man for himself and ethics economics and political life it is absurd to hold for solid piece based on fictions and illusions
 and then the quote already so instead of loving what you think is peace love other men and love God above all and instead of hating the people you think are warmongers he just if we heard that the beginning we think I'm not in a war Monger but after reading I wouldn't believe I'd be like maybe I am a warlock and so she says instead of hating the people you think are warmongers hate the appetites and the disorder in your own soul which are the causes of War if you love peace and Hayden just
hate your new Hatebreed but hate these things in yourself and I know that makes sense when I have a strong appetite for whatever
 there can't be peace because if you got it I want it I means I'm going after everybody with my appetite. Attention all of this band that had the song give me peace and Anarchy is a piece and I don't you want peace and Anarchy play the opposite
 anyway again I've seen certain people I tell you some I just met with your about you today and in some ways you know like I think one way I
 I relate to what we just read the things I've seen in my life was I do four years around us while he was at the Barclay Center you know he's the leader that doesn't he doesn't
he tries to inspire people to kind of come to their own higher nature he doesn't get in and change everything in order people what to do so much he keeps trying to point the way to people adopted heart and everybody thinks yeah that's me you know that's that's who I am that's how I live you know but is it reminds me there's always a really you know and you have to go deeper and it's so always he said there that bird for the place to be really successful and really change people's lives he says you know how well you leave kirtan how expert your classes are or whatever he said more important than that has to do with the mood that's created among the people that are here that if they feel like this is it is an atmosphere where people really love and respect one another trust one another that is like a like a real family like you know he said that more than anything will touch people and move people and and
years we were kind of yeah course that's what we do here at the store trying to do but like I saw a beer he kind of took it to another level where he just really non-stop came from that platform and it really did have a dynamic effect on the place and in the life of Radha soami am self I've seen him do that were like again what people talk about Tyler's I've seen him Tyler things that most people would never talk and it's even tolerate behavior and inimical Behavior focus at him
 where everybody cycle come on this is enough been made not only will he tolerate that he will not say a word critical of the person that's coming from and if someone comes forward with a critical analysis Hill
 he'll interpret it another way like that is it you think it's coming from another let it seems like we read journey home it seems like you only had it the first time we went to Indian had definitely had something special coming into the game yeah you know you know it is interesting cuz when I was thinking about this
cuz I want it I want to see how do I get you I just keep reading these books and try to apply it and trial and error and fail and win a little and I was thinking when I seen that some people are going to say okay so you not going to do anything about the war that's happening in the world everybody should just go into the navel-gazing and not worry about what's happening in life but the more I thought about them
 until we actually change we just just the exploitation of Shifting board is it's just like kind of a war that never ends and occasionally people come along in history that actually do move people that actually kind of to push Society broader Society in a certain in a certain direction and their people that do demonstrate very unique qualities saintly qualities qualities of Tolerance qualities of forgiveness qualities of selflessness and I do think that those are things that's something that's likely cultivated over the course of several lifetimes so you hear something like this music
seems like you're saying this is what I want and maybe I maybe if I think like this and try to act on a deeply in this life I don't have a deep effect on the world but maybe I do my next life you know like maybe I come out the next life and I'm and I'm on a whole another level and I'm you know and I'm I'm given the circumstances and the opportunities in the platforms to demonstrate what can actually really helped people that vote could really change brought her circumstances, Smyrna I mean he's thinking about you since he's recognizing these things he's he's watching you know current events play out you know it lining up against you know history and understanding that the spiritual teachings that you know applying spiritual teachings that he's contemplating everyday and seeing how it plays out and I think he's coming up with the same idea that all deep spiritual is come to
let me see some electric a to the reading about not right it's just like he got such a such a heavy hostile kind of curse thrown his way and he said he had some desires then he got those desires fulfilled and then he got to take him away from me to the proper greeting processes in an M&M to acceptance and then don't waste them to come to the platform of wisdom or with it yeah right it was nice I had a nice talk with Tyra last night how are as great as great here he does all our Retreats and handles everything but it you know what I've known Tara since I've known you and so you know nice to watch escrow to the different seasons of life and now we're like old man
I was going to 15 year old and I got a 18 year old and and it's just like you know me like we been we've been through the life now or hairs are gray you know
 you're not a pretty good it really changed my sister but it's sort of like the realization that come with those different seasons of life and you start to see the reaching out of trying to hold on to that Eternal message through it all this whole process forces you to see life as an eternal thing that you know we are not talking stupid rock enough of what we were within our twenties or thirties or forties or we're just going to turn up being in the waves of the body or just shifting around and going on and we and we hold on we try to give some love and try to do some service can we make some mistakes and we don't get to move move ahead but
trying to hold on to that truth and you see that you know we're not possessors of anything in this world and you just get profound realization just can't watch him here when he retired just wasn't lecturing me but I wish it was almost like getting a lecture and I was learning from his realizations you know I think I think I when we first started doing nugget sweet we went to the punch punch for a little bit and over that the panchatantra like the Aesop's Fables were based on the punt return these ancient Indian stories with with morals and I remember there are other places across like an Indian sacred texts but I think there's like what is the greatest gift you know when it's in its knowledge you know and then it gives all the different reasons why knowledge is the best gift to you know like you can't lose it and can't see it in all these different things but it really is and in in one sense knowledge can be given and then ultimately wisdom has to be called
baited by the individual where they can give someone wisdom you can give some of knowledge and then they have to take that knowledge and go through life and generally through suffering in life and if I apply it will reflect on it and then continent as they age that wisdom hopefully kind of manifest and all of the we're seeing here like we were just reading yesterday that tooth decay 2 was like oh well ship is talking about your K2 and saying that most people they they they're doing this thing where the differentiate differentiate between good and bad or happiness in distress in this world and that a wise person just sees all of this good and bad in all this happiness and distress is just kind of all
 bad again it's like being in the prison whether it's a happy day in the prison or Saturday in the prison here in the prison in in there's a spiritual freedom
that is the true happiness and that's why this idea of you know that probably kept his book Krishna Consciousness the topmost yoga system I'm never seen that book when I was young I was like sounds a little secretary secretary and yours is the Batman symbol
 within Vedic thought which is which is vast there's ways to counteract Bad Karma there's ways to move up there's ways to improve the quality of your help the quality of your breath the quality of your mind the quality of your diet all these things but in Krishna Consciousness it's not about Nest those things come naturally is about actually try sending this world in these books again and again push you to see yourself outside of what we've been labeling our self since we were born I'm Ray cappo I'm you know was born in Brewster New York and you know it
this is my identity is making a self see ourselves with the bigger identity the bigger I
 yeah yeah alright so more. Let's let's hear more about this and it'll give us something to contemplate all right before he started to stream on what time we should I bring me the conquest what you got respect for a base and see if the Supreme Lord Narayan aren't you know Andre see the soup most human being until mother just watching the goddess of learning and to show that the officer gave the author not a separation from The Bob & Tom and Veterinary Service Lapeer devotees all that is troublesome to Hartwick muriatic acid and loving service to the Supreme Lord it was praised the transit songs we established
Honda CRV engine shuts off my base and sees at their Lotus feet
 do you know the guy you start massaging my feet with his knuckles really hard so ticklish I almost lost my marbles
 I just felt like a little lady
 what to do
 all right
 thinking
 okay
6:30 again yesterday taking Lake considers a flower Garland to be a snake or experiences happiness and distress in a dream so in the material world by lack of careful consideration we differentiate between happiness and distress
 considering one good and the other bad
 they're all there to push us further on a spiritual journey
 okay shut the happiness in the stress of the material world of Duality are both mistaken ideas in the chase on the charts and Retail Hunter Lila 4176 it says like they bhadrapada ganish album on the distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of the Wildey are simply mental concoctions
 for the so-called happiness
stressor actually won in the same now this is something very interesting if you're going to understand I think if we could just read that to like 100 people
 what would be the immediate responses that bring distress and they're very different and this is this is a completely different way of looking at the distinction between happiness in distress in this material world to do out or simply mental concoctions for the so-called happiness and distress or actually won in the same there like to happiness in distress and dreams sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming although actually they have no existence I mean I've done this in the course of a massage I want you to die when do the massage in a good mood that during the massage like I created this whole turbo snare and it's the massages today today massage happy thoughts things are good in the massage
as I get older my children Haley
 that's what I thought the whole and I created scenarios in my brain where there were hating me for no good reason either I just got to thinking like that and then like everything our joy and our happiness I went in happy I would enjoy it and it felt good but I want in a happy came out sad I was just thinking I'm just mentally concocting everything that's going on cuz no matter where I am does matter what I have this matter who I'm with no matter what my economic status says it's a matter fact I took them to be the happiest when I'm in the most broke sometimes in the most distressed when I've had the most money you know I mean everything that should make us happy doesn't necessarily make us happy and it probably is a big reason why a big part of the yoga practice is to realize the mind is not us cuz it's cray
happiness and distress on a regular basis that have nothing to do with reality they have nothing to do with it there's two different Realms there's a round of Illusion is around with reality when we going to movie theater there's two rounds going on with in that room right right like eating popcorn is me sitting in the chair yeah that's we we call that the realm of reality and what's going on in screen we called around the pollution by the Titanic and then there's a scene where like the Geico this is this is happiness right like okay so then you think things are good uses good right this is happy I feel happy okay then later on
it's going down I think he's like slipping into the water and life is like she's in the boat and he's gone he's gone into the freezing cold water it was playing the violin you like all this is bad this is bad this is this is this brings misery this is suffering and you're sitting in the chair in love and suffering and then cry search so so now that's the illusory world we all except that everyone everyone accepts that that's an illusory world and then and then you're sitting in the chair in quote unquote reality and you're being moved through happiness in distress being influenced by the illusory world now if someone would just wear to say everything that's going on and it's green it's neither good or bad in your in the reality it's just a loser it's a movie it's not real it's entirely unreal but still because you're identifying with the characters you're feeling
penis in distress on what's going on in this other illusory realm that's all the problem it's saying here that's what that's all that he saying you know he said he sended he's using dreams instead of a movie he's using that right but more or less it's saying that if we understood that we are in a sense in a virtual reality or innocence living in a in a movie then we would understand that this world is neither good or bad it's a movie and that there's a realm outside with that is reality that we actually exist in that we are the spark of spirit moving through a round of Illusion now you could also put it like of course we get it you know it's you know we're watching the movie with falling in love or feeling good out to Terrace Park movie and feeling frightful but we can actually do this within our own body
 I can think of the most stressful situation myself or another like when I was helping her leave his body There Was X when he was
do you like going through the process of leaving his body where you was incredibly Joyce now you know despite what was actually going on he's about to lose everything including his body including his family including his parents and he's about to lose everything but there was a Joyce separate then what was going on on the screen of the material world there was an interconnection then there in time I remember times when I was late and I had colder than I thought I was going to die and I'm laying in the hospital bed with my go over. She never comes and some when I students show up and they are they happy you know it's like to teach someone to control the mind is the highest thing you could do because it's around the corner
 and
 no one gets a pass from it this tragedy happened right now we know trashy turn the news tragedy
you're in that tragedy in a moment in a moment
 thank you sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice in a dream yes at least Indian people do you share the trim a propagator some sweet guys and I of course sex dreams there's like errors or night terrors both both both ways when you wake up you feel like you've experienced one of the other you feel like they're really feel like they're real and dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if our beloved family members had died I had a dream of a wrestling a wild boar
I kid you not it was a real just the other day I woke up sweating I need to tell you that I hope he wasn't had you in a headlock while he was Jamie
 in dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes we suffer as if our beloved family members have died so there's happiness in distress in the dreams because the same this isn't because the same mind and body exist in the same Material World of Duality when we are awake over that again because the same mind and body exist in the same Material World of Duality when we are awake the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the fall superficial happiness of dreams that listen is the mind is
buy medium in both dreams and wakefulness
 spiritual by Pastor before we go there let's hear what he's saying hear the mind is the vibe medium in both dreams and wakefulness and everything created by the mind in terms of song called Envy called the acceptance and rejection is called Mono Dharma or mental concoct so he said, that's the word for mental concussion he's saying that we had this equipment called the material mind it's real home is within the material world which is a world of Illusion whether it's the the world that what we call reality or the double illusion which we called dreams we're still using the same exact equipment to access it and therefore whatever we're accessing through it is illusion and when we access reality we're not ask
sing it through this material mind or accessing it beyond the material Mart
 interesting very interesting as far as bypassing goes yeah just because that that's kind of like a matrix question it's like the idea was once he understood that he was in a matrix he became a fact it only when he deeply understood that he was in The Matrix did he become effective within the Matrix right and so that would be my answer that when we fully understand the delusion nature this world we actually become most effective in helping people one navigate it
 into Transcendent sure where I'd like in terms of navigating it for instance if we simply understood that we are all equal on a spiritual level.
I'm moving to the different bodies different races different genders different species if we all really understood that will be treated we wouldn't feel any one alien to us cuz we realized I was in that alien position and said that would help us navigate this world and bring peace into this world and then beyond that with with the death of that realization we could understand the true happiness my deepest satisfaction doesn't come from anything in the loser Ramen in that pudding powers to transcend it so is that black ass so you slip into Goodra she's slipping into the Matrix then we become part of that nature anger with me all the time and then I get caught in that glue Trap Of The Matrix and that's what time is smyrna's address and I think his own his own realization from his own
this is as a Christian Monk and then and then informed by the readings that he was doing and in the Eastern literature and upon his shots and in British literature which is based on who punished as he was able to see these kind of things very clearly think Thomas Martin with a lie to you I think I would like him if you have been good friends what about you and how is your prince okay you can hang out with your chairs Ringo would like you

 next verse
 to go back there that's how you do it already
 text 30
 11 persons engaged in bhakti devotional service.
positive Krishna have naturally perfect knowledge and Detachment from this material world
 therefore such devotees are not interested in the so-called happiness or so-called distress of this world
 disburse a kind of bomb Echoes another more famous person box on this one reads Boston Dave a bug of a T-10 respecting wood bottom numb piano by rogia Shreya
 I'll read it again I'll putting persons engaged in devotional service to the Lord boss today about Krishna have naturally perfect knowledge so that Keanu which is what a lot of people in the yoga world are looking for a Ride Like the gannys to particular perfect
I'm not this body this mature world is illusion they understand how the mind works all that kind of knowledge they're saying that if you have devotional Christian you already had that knowledge it comes with you know who's that nundini a liberated being too nice like she was born realize they're born in a lotus lotus open and she was like child baby Robert girl so so here is saying if you if you have if you're engaged
 in bhakti then you had naturally naturally not artificially but naturally like sometimes you say natural like oh that person is a natural at this or that meaning it doesn't seem to require requiring any extra extra effort they just have it naturally and so for the body always did how did how do Gana Yogi's call debate knowledge they do it a lot of practicing or not
Station by walking away from home walking away from family practice in austerities hear it saying that the body has a naturally without any of that kind of endeavor they they have natural Detachment from this things in this world because you're interested shifted from a world of Sam's Crab case into world of inner satisfaction and line up so they haven't they have naturally perfect knowledge and Detachment from the material world there for such the boys are not interested in the so-called happiness or so-called the stress of this world here is the distinction between a devotee and a philosopher who speculates on the subject matter of transcendence
 a devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary existence of this material world because of their unalloyed Devotion to this knowledge and attachment or automatically manifest in this
asking for an ulcer and schuerbach time and that's the worst of which Ahmed Raza David Beckham booty booty yoga Bridget are going to get the one who engage is an unalloyed devotional service bhakti to Vasa Deva Krishna automatically becomes aware of this material world and therefore they are naturally detached naturally and write this attachment is possible because of their high standard of knowledge it means there's this is what bug of agita say where did Krishna saying he's providing so much knowledge knowledge that is there a new punished. He's really bug of agita is like a a comparative study of different levels of yoga and it's saying it and they're Krishna saying you know what the what the four Vedas was talking to for bettas Arjuna let that stuff go because that's for how to enjoy this material world and that's you you you you evolve beyond that let let all that stuff go
then he speaking on the upanishads level saying you do all that stuff about how the soul is eternal the body is temporary and how the mind works and etcetera said but then he says but there's more confidential knowledge right there a secret to all of this wisdom I'm going to share that with you are doing it and you know why he doesn't say because you're the most pronounced so I don't because you're the most alerted I thought he said because you have no Envy in Your Heart Right it has to do with the state of his heart so when he says here he says that the devotee they have this Detachment is possible because of their high standard of knowledge the high standard of knowledge is even beyond what the Guiana Yogi has the yin yoga understands all these things I'm not this body the breakdown of all the material elements how the eye is the separate from it and is observing it all in and all that but when one understands Krishna
 when one understands it behind all of it is this person this beautiful person this loving and kind person
that is both everything is in that person that person is in everything when you begin to understand that person you have a higher level of Gianna and that and when you have that Guiana the things of this world you you you develop an interest in that person and just by your interest in that person loving interest in that person the things of this world automatically naturally become of no interest to you
 so you goes on the speculative philosopher tries to understand that when he says that he needs beginning Yogi the speculative lost four tries to understand that this matter will this false by cultivating knowledge but this understanding is automatically manifested in a person in the in the person of a devotee without separate endeavor
 Rain-X
 am I wrap up this chapter I think so maybe
 text 32 neither I Lord Shiva
your Brahma nor the SVT, Florida or other great sages who are brahmas Sons nor even the demigods can understand the Past Times and personality of the Supreme Lord although you part of the Supreme Lord we consider ourselves independent separate controllers unless we cannot understand his identity Unlimited
 these are interesting verses that he holds no one as very dear and no one is inimical he has no one for his own relative and no one is alien to him is actually the soul of the soul and of all living entities of all living and the soul of the soul of all the entities the sea is the auspicious friend of all living beings and is very near and dear to all of them sounds a little contradictory. I will you poop and contradictory right
so it's first says he holds no one is very dear no one is as an amicable has no one who has his own relative and no one who's yelling too but then it says he's auspicious friend to all living beings and he's very near and dear to all of them so when it says he he holds no one very dear and no one is inimical exit you want to get a job and you're qualified for the job you're more qualified than someone else but that someone else is a relative of the person that's doing the hiring now you've got a problem now you have someone now you now you're living in a world in an unjust world
 by Merit it's by some yeah so it's saying that you know someone makes it look what I go through in life and someone else has had such an easier time wise God being unfair like this just like just like this boss
going to hire someone that's their relative you know I didn't do anything wrong but it seems like someone else is dear to God and I'm not there to that and it's a no no no it's not like that he's no one is dear and no one is inimical to him in that sense but then it's going on to say that but that. The person who is behind everything he's an auspicious friend I wonder what the term mungala
 auspicious friends
 sarva booster Priya everyone is very dear to him
 appear at Movado to being the sole of Souls of a boot on a map of all living entities sarva bhuteshu to all living entities Pria. Very very dear hoodie going to hurry so it's saying that he's this person that's like he he's not he's not everybody's got to a fair shot in this world nobody is he's not favoring anyone over another season
on just at the same time he's actually very dear and loving to every single living Me by intense heat would blow the ship is doing right now as he's talking about the character to Decay 2 Into the Depths the chicken cages understanding of of of the Lord he he earlier yesterday thing was we we read that verse in the Rhine up her that the the devotees of Gordon Ryan or Lord Vishnu that they have no fear they see all the different levels just like in a movie if we wanted to movie theater we saw there's a hellish scene in the movie and there's a Heavenly scene in the movie but to us it's all the same it's all the movie
 to the devotees of Lord arai and the good in the bad in this did the sufferings and enjoyment so this world they see it all as one thing that I will do people value and that that was just a kind of blowing away Parvati cuz she gave this curse your she's expecting he was going to tell you we tally
suffer his heels in Via orange or whatever you know and and he he didn't at all he was totally transcend it to it so now it's sharing the understanding of who Vishnu is in what church of K2 understands about vision and 35 the magnanimous to is a deer devotee of the Lord is equal to all living entities and is free from attachment and hatred similarly I'm also very dear Lord and Ryan you noticed one thing sorry to stop you but if we go back to a Thomas Merton was saying okay this magnanimous choo choo K2 is a very dear devoted Lord he is equal to all the manatees
 and he's free from attachment attachment and hatred now Thomas Byrne was saying like yep Simon says yeah I'm free from hatred I want there to be peace but I'm not free of attachment I have it says he's free
Cashman and hates it so if I'm not free of attachment my attachment is likely going to play out in the suffering of another living being so until you actually you're not just free of hatred but free of attachment you're not truly free of hatred you know you're not really true causing harm to others to Decatur Street both
 similarly I am also there dear Lord Narayan therefore no one should be astonished to see the activities of the most exalted devotees of Narayan for they are free from attachment and which means like hostility or hatred or hatred or they are always peaceful and they are always and they are equal to everyone even when she cursed him he treated her as a friend
 text 36 shizuka Dave goswami said okay after hearing the speech by her husband the demigoddess Uma
what she gave up her astonishment at the behavior king batch of K2 and became steady and intelligent that's very interesting right you know someone's chastising you the farmer neighbor you and I just my response was yeah I'm sort of foolish thanks for pointing that out comes to things like that that's called pulling at your K2 what you did and she's obviously such an incredibly deep being yes that that that what what that was implied by that
 that she gave up her astonishing meant where I shoot at first she said what and then she heard from Chivas like
