Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday lined up at 7 a.m. timer set at New Yorkers come down to generation records at 1 in the afternoon or this in the village right that's in the in the bill in Greenwich Village yeah generation records were doing an in-store Q&A you know before we get into the show today I want to just my host here is one of our regulars Rumours David hauswirth but he's a pretty interesting story when you come on down here David's house for lady Rich Roll podcast
 are very much David take them like what you know what's your origin story here where you end up here listen to his messages regular regularly and I know your sisters on the show right now tell us a little bit about your story place so my origin story starts with my sister Heather Heather stand who's the Zoomer currently
 while I was going through my active recovery which is par
bat recovery part of the body recovery podcast Rich Roll was very and she want influential in that and the fact that it made me know that it was okay to be a dentecane that it was okay to need to be recovering that alcoholism substance abuse does not define who we are as individuals that are spirits sold at the Pines us as individuals
 and then I'm sorry I'm trying not to emotional currently no emotions absolutely no emotion
 shelter was another band that or a band that influenced me a lot growing up as a kid to the point that I paid air guitar to those first shelter albums who didn't you know me and with ball bat thinking I was a mon do you know
I was not at all in any way shape or form but I want squirrel on that part of it
 so
 my sister Heather brought to me Rich Roll podcast with Robin off and said listen to this podcast and in that and that podcast he made two statements that were very profound to me it's we are all dented cans and we are all looking for a god-shaped hole to fill
 and that's all it took from there I started listening to the podcast and I've been a Zoomer ever since I don't think I've missed more than four shows and now I go back and I listen to spiritual thought process I so I listen to zoom in in the morning that I listen to 4 hours of back catalogues then I listen to shelter then I listen to the MARTA ride then I listen to the Ramadan then I'll just keep
listening to cuz what we put into our ears is what's going into our brains and what's going to go into our hearts and move us forward and that's what it is and it's all of you on this podcast every single person who's looking back at me and Robin off right now has changed my life and has affected my life all of you have saved me from myself so thank you for everything I everybody does everyday thank you David sometimes it is song reinforces the idea that somehow we started the cleanest thing every single day every day
 once a week is something but when you do something everyday it's it works its way into your life in such a way that it can really be transformative
 that's that's the power I brought that point up yesterday that we do this
today because that's what the baggage on tells us to do and I've seen it happen to other people actually happen to myself you get a second you get a set of bug of a Tom's but you never crack them open they just become sort of like a painting on the wall yet not just crack them open but make them daily daily it's a daily read and because of it it will start to take you on a ride self-discovery and it will give you what you need it won't give you what you want I'll give you what you need and that's beautiful and scary and wonderful and Tobago Tom has been like a in my own life it's been like someone throws me off a lifesaver I'm out at Sea until someone throws were one of those Lifesavers in a rope and and pulls me in from a stormy sea is so ungrateful as well and communities everything is somehow without even
 I don't even think we had the foresight to steal but it's the community
it is really powerful with listen to the stage this we have a very very good support of community
 it's good to hear what store are the stories you don't know those stories say that that's encouraging their encouraging I'm excited that the Box recovery
 Group in podcast is mentioned on the Rich Roll
 yeah that's a real good yeah I'm going to I'm going to try to get her on it that would be great if you could get saint
 the whole mother thing all right you want to go into back to the bottom of time sir I do and then I'll go get my stage Dive Club clothing on after that especially if you guys like special rubber bubble that I get inside they just roll me off stage like a year 58 year old you're 58 years old. Now so you got to go in a bubble what if you just went out there like in a
call uniform
 yeah that's the way to do it too with a mouth guard
 okay are we on chapter 7 the only way yet before we start the show me about what time we should I bring me into Conquest when should offer respectful of agencies to the Supreme Lord Narayan Bhajan are in a ride reach you this you were mostly would be bunch of other stars watching the goddess of learning and she'll be off Saturday of the author not stop radiation badri Sunni chambakka by all that is troublesome to the heart would become eradicated I love you service the Supreme Lord who is Ray's the transmittal songs will be established as it arrived a couple of home again at the Menendez
Dana does my history go to bed in my heart I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open in my eyes are the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet me to finish my by the time you can't do 7
 chapter 77
 text Mom. I'm a little lost in the Texas Tech under 25 but let's let's just too good of a recap here yeah recapit please somebody weekend so we have this fascinating conversation resuming to not hear children do kids
 headed up by by prolonged who's I believe 5 years old it is not your average five-year-old note has been trained his is he's already demonstrated incredible courage
 speaking truth to power he's already demonstrated a car
like spiritual Insight that makes that for him is like he can't it's almost like they're trying to corrupt him they're trying to bring his Consciousness down you know ditched his teachers as his father they've been trying to bring him into this worldly us them kind of friends enemy kind of type of thinking and he's just like I'm sorry I do not relate to that I cannot relate relate I will not relate to that and then it's cooked on hot you know what you created some issues even to the point where they tried to kill him a little bit of an issue but they they tried in different ways and somehow mystically they couldn't pull it off and then the teachers are kind like you know what let's just a phase
 let's let's just say let's keep working on him so mean while they weren't counting on his he's about to kind of like influence all the rest of the kids so now
he's speaking to his his five-year-old classmates and he's going to give them spiritual teachings that go from like the conventional you know two people that are unfamiliar
 with the hole with a done to write with the ancient texts of these ancient texted engine this might
 the unfamiliar bunch of people that are somewhat familiar familiar with that he starting in the conventional it's going to start with understanding that we're not the body that we are the spark of spiritual energy that is known by its primary quality that it is conscious right it is aware I am that awareness within the body he's going to go from that all the way up to the most esoteric deeply spiritual beautiful devotional kind of teachings but this kind of cold is it
application of Gano which means knowledge where you begin to try to discern
 who am I registered a very practical way that a lot of people may never even people write like the religious traditions
 a lot of the religion like at least the way that I think you and I learned them we were never kind of like in all of our catechism I don't think anyone ever said like who am I you know it's like let's try to experience unless you feel that I had no clue what the soul was I thought the solar sort of like a ghost-like thing that look just like me but was invisible and was not bound by time and space but it was you know it was it comes after I die there's no soul in the body it was never quite explained to me I didn't understand the concept of a personal God I did Tyler send a personal God but not that had got had a particular form
or a face like a picture of faceless being in a chair like some type of Throne thinking although I do you know I think I just have her kid it I don't think I'm going to gym so I also want to demystifies this also because I'm going to hear these stories okay if 5 year old boy was teaching a bunch of five year old boys guess what there's some pretty impressive five year old toys for 5 year old boys now or Prodigy's world or girls what prodigies in music and art in dance and singing and it in mathematics in chess unbelievable stuff
but there's also and just because they are they almost seem like what the who the hell is this kid so you might even think we'll maybe there's some magical being not necessarily they could be completely materialistic they just might have a fine-tuned some particular material skill like mathematics or it in a drumming or something or piano but we've also seen these spiritual prodigies in at least in the Indian tradition you hear about this all the time Robert pods Guru
 4 year old Master the bug of agita for your you know what were you doing at 4 years old and I was like pulling the arms off my GI Joes that's what I was doing. I like burning things when I wasn't studying the bug of agita then there was a shocker Charge It 2 Chainz
India he took cineas at 8 years old that means he told his mother I'm giving up the world for for God I will see you again I will see you again and he wandered with thousands of disciples that end in left temple is there still temples you can go to that he started in his childhood so this is not like a new thing in the Indian yogis and yogurt Masters so they're also realities also what do you know we're going to have I was thinking you mentioned demystify and it's a fact that you know our tendency is to kind of shrink existence down into our experience kind of bubble and think that anything if it doesn't fit within what I've experienced in this life then it don't say it is irrational or unrealistic
grammatical or whatever but occasionally we see we get glimpses of what the possibilities are there. We're just not always thought I was just think one great example is
 this a little film clip that I saw this autistic person get some kind of some kind of special autism my I don't remember exactly was called but
 they would take him and fly him over man hat in an airplane just like one flight over and then he was sitting on a huge stretch of paper
 incredible detail jar like every building in Manhattan and scale like right now like somehow his memory
 was able to pick all of that up and not only that even kind of compose that picture in his head so he could come and reproduce it almost like a photograph thousands of buildings up their placement their sizes so what
that indicate about the potential of a human being and just because we don't see people doing that very much now doesn't mean that there weren't times where people were tapping into their potential in very different ways and we are now well if you ever if you've ever ever studied any cultural art music martial arts dance
 and then you think like well imagine if I never study Jiu-Jitsu I would never know it but because of it I have some like skill in my pocket so to speak or if you studied dance you could whip out and start dancing if you did ten years of ballet or something you never know your your potential with your body and with your mind and with your movement etcetera imagine these people who just really refined some facet of their intelligence it doesn't go away when you die that stays in your cell phone we see a five year old who has an incredible intelligence during credit
spiritual Acumen or they have some you know there was a kid who could play the table has incredibly at age 5 and then they brought Masters to hear him in there like we can't understand how this boy knows these Table Pizza at his age either very Advanced Tabla beats up it seems almost freakish but now is it if you don't forget that stuff you pick up where you last left off it stays in your subtle body and then it manifests again in this life and the same is true with your spiritual Acumen you pick up where you last left off and we've met people and I'm sure people out there met people who almost alike are spiritually do you try to explain something to them and they're like no no way no they just can't hear it and then there's some people from a young age are so attracted and almost like thoughtful deep you know deeply rooted and connected and and kind it's as if they've been practicing something
spiritual path for lifetimes and they may be completely different than their family they might not even grown up grew up in a family that is a very spiritual or thoughtful family and they might be like the the black sheep of the family this purse is very gentle and thoughtful like provide was and then what happens is by that ability or by that whatever you whatever you shine in you become an influencer and whether it's it can be with you showing that you could be in some corrupt behaviour as well you could Influence People in a horrible way but in your spiritual life if you really shine then all the sudden people see up I want to be like that and this is where perladas at right now he's influencing he's he's one of the early influences okay so end in the where he's starting with his teaching series is this kind of almost typical kind of ganic path
he saying this is what we read last. I was text 2624 he said sober and expert person's okay sober means here
 people that aren't always we talked about being drunk on the world right or not you know I can I can I'm not thrown off
 you know I can think clear I'm not I'm not overly influenced by different aspects of conditioning in whatever form they may come they're not if they're not affecting my clarity of thought but I'm sober the silver persons who are experts should reach for the spirits search search for the spirits soul with mines purified through analytic study in terms of the Soul connection with and distinction from
 all things that undergo creation maintenance and destruction so this is key here right this is a very fundamental
teaching of a down to fundamental ganic kind of approach that there is we're living in a world and living in a body that's made up of matter that a type of energy that is it's characterized by its constant constantly being flocked as it is constantly in the cycle of creation maintenance and ultimate destruction and then around again and again and again but there's someone that observes that some of that observes the world around us going through those changes someone that observes the their own body going through those changes that's the me that I need to find I need to identify that and therefore I begin to break down right at my this hand no right cuz I'm observing the hand and so on it is it's a it's an analytical kind of approach to understanding who am I on a spiritual level so that brings us to today's text text number 25
 intelligence can be perceived in three states of active
wakefulness dreaming and deep sleep the person who perceives these three is to be considered the original Master the ruler the Supreme personality of godhead
 they speak about the outline the partnership with this but it says here in this year
 Santa Lucia para so it's saying there's a person inside
 a purusha but here's his proof Zapata so that means not just the soul that we said there's two Souls with anybody right now Super Soul to put up with Lucia near the higher the Supreme the Super Soul so so this verse is it it's it seems to be indicating that within this body there is Austin or we go through
 three different states of awareness is kind of like our car where Ennis like if we're the spark of spirit
 that's manifesting this awareness I feel
experience eyewitness I observe and so on that that awareness is being filtered through three different states of of being in those beings are the states of being recalled wakefulness dreaming and deep sleep and we all know those are we've all been through them
 you don't know what it's like to be awake we're probably awake right now most of us and and we all know what it's like to dream sometimes even when we're dreaming were no we know where do which is weird right yeah that's weird I'm happy I'm Dreaming this deep sleep is is this some state where the where is his kind of shut down
 and we're kind of like it's almost like
 like one when you something like when you turn off your computer with the battery still there
 you no answer the bat so it's like if you if you close your computer
open it up five hours later the the clock is still right on time because the battery was there all along but it wasn't it wasn't processing any information okay that's a good analogy surterra yeah I'm going to keep that one close the computer is still running and they open up your own with the hell happened yesterday there's no processing of information in that stayed but at the awareness is kind of still there in the Layton State and we know deep sleep you know how we know deep sleep because when we wake up we feel this refreshing like we feel I was just in deep sleep I was so I was knocked out I wasn't even dreaming I was just gone right so this is something that these these Yogi's Indies Gianni's they they would think about that they didn't like we grew up here just to get whatever I was dreaming or wasn't or whatever they're like watch to put watch that world that I was in
and what can you tell me about myself trying to analyze all these things so so this is where he's starting he's saying that our intelligence our awareness is passing through three different States and its color but it's affected by those States just like
 you know where we get in different states according to our awareness gets affected by external filters bright like a million different ways like if you put me in a really noisy place my weariness is changed by that and if you put me in a silent place my weariness Has Changed by that and I and I witnessed both of those states that my own thoughts go through and so silly that these are fundamental Cesar wakefulness dreaming deep sleep we're passing through the state's the person perceives these three
 is to be considered the original mass and he said that this is a key thing right
 that were saying that there's
one of us is as individual spark of energy with their own individual consciousness
 our own individual experience of the our own bodies and of the world that we share
 I don't know what's going on and ruggedness body right now
 I mean like I don't know if you're hungry because my weariness is not within your body you don't know if I'm hungry
 you know if you're hungry and I know if I'm hungry cuz our awareness is is situated here within the bike but there were saying that there's a there's another soul and this so they use different sounds right like sometimes they said like if you have like a thousand pots of water
 on the ground in sun is in the sky than the sun is appearing and every one of those pots that is it. All the spots out of this part of ma, this is also a manifestation of of God is present within everyone's body so I don't know if we're going to Stronger
nope I'm hungry but knows whether I'm hungry whether you're hungry brother I was cuz he's situated and everybody
 and so this verse is wrong with you want to see the commentary this some cool
 this commentary of lost my spot 25 25 years
 without intelligence one can understand the direct activities of the senses nor can he understand Dreaming or the cessation of all gross and subtle Activities The Seer and controller is the Supreme personality of God had the Supreme Soul by whose Direction the individual soul can understand what he is awake when he is sleeping and when he is completely in trance so so that's so there's there's two of us but one is in each part one is like the controller so like
 sometimes I can't sleep even though I want to
sometimes I wake up what is it that woke me up it's saying that our ability to perceive these different states of awareness is facilitated by that Supreme Soul within everyone that there's this there's this all pervasive being within the body of every living being there too
 incense regulate the different experiences that they have including these three different states of the wakefulness
 they're going to quote the about it with you to this famous person the gator 1515 if you're if you're looking for a new password out your own should we check in with the corona that she knows
 Korean knows this one Corona 1515 she going to show cuz he was
 turn on
 are you on meeting her if I can't find her okay I'm going to do it
I'm sorry you had your chance in the Sun
 with the Lord says Service yet to release any of his stole my birthday Gangnam when I'm sure I'm seated in everyone's heart and from me become remembrance knowledge in forgetfulness
 living entities are completely absorbed in three states of wakefulness dreaming and deep sleep through their intelligence
 this intelligence has supplied us with personality God had little company's individual saw as a friend
 show the mud vicharje that's one of the great previous Masters as that the living entity is sometimes described as suck the booty when is intelligence act directly to perceive pains and Pleasures above activities
 set pure intelligence
what is until just asked directly to perceive pains and Pleasures above activities activities sure he's got Pure intelligence when is intelligence acts directly to receive pains and pledges the next census who says there is a dreaming state in which understanding comes from the screen person out the godhead the screen person out of godhead the Super Soul is the Supreme controller and under his direction to living entities are sub controllers one must understand the Supreme person out of head with one's intelligence so I guess that we're being pointed toward madhvacharya is commentary if you want to learn more about this but it's saying that the living ideas sometimes described as separate booty when its intelligence acts directly to perceive
 are pleasures and pains our ups and downs above activities which seems to be like above car
yeah I don't know exactly what context is being said and then it's so he's saying you want to learn more about that go check out
 commentary on this verse
 okay alright
 going forward 26 as one can understand the presence of the air by a Roma's it carries write the aroma is different than the air so under the guidance of the screen person out of God had one coming dressed and the living Soul by these three divisions of intelligence these three divisions however are not the sole they are constituted of the three goodness but three modes and are born of activities activities means it's our previous activities are, that gave us a combination of a certain recipe right combination of of ingredients that cry
experience is that we're going through the show they're all sort of Illusions even your wakefulness is a type of allusion in right so that's dominated by say good night dreaming passion deep sleep ignorance
 I'm asking you I'm not even I wasn't even thinking in those terms but they're there might be a pair of the unlike a kind of correlation it says they're constituted of the three modes and a board of activities that's why that's why I got that from but the idea is that the aroma is in the air it's not the air it's it's been it's being it's being carried by the air in the same way we have this illusion in the awake world I'm here in Connecticut and it's a temporary reality and then we have our Dream which is a real temporary reality
 go ahead
please don't doubt and asleep and that's another type of temporary reality yeah it's it's again what we're working here to find is an earlier verse few verses back number for life he was using the sinologist like a an expert can find gold with in Iron ore or just we can imagine someone panning for gold right it's like you stick that thing there and then in the dirt in the Stream in the creek I'm having a gold and then you kind of like shake it up and you kind of start filtering the thing out and you're looking within their can I find something special something that you need something is different and so what perladas instructing his friends and his how do we find the soul that spark of spirit within this body made of matter
 write an. He says he's using an analogy to help us do that because
 just like we can't see the air
 but because the areas are is caring
Roma's it indicates that the air exists you can infer right because one minute the air is carrying this a Roma and the next moment they are is are is carrying another Aroma you can't see the air but you understand that there's are that's carrying these Aroma Di Roma has become evidence of the existence of the air which is necessary to carry them answer simile we're not able to see the soul
 but because we feel the surpassing first always passing through this state of consciousness one moment and then later on is passing through another state of consciousness on that is passing through a third state of consciousness those States Of Consciousness do not exist they can only be perceived by a living Soul so the fact that they're being perceived means that the soul is there is this a type of inference
 again the previous verse had said
back in and not text 23:24 was talking about sober expert person searching for the soul with these purified mines and their analytical study trying to find study in terms of the souls connection with the distinction from connection with and distinction from all things that undergo creation maintenance in destruction so in a sense of those states of awareness I'm awake and my wife on this is is kind of boring when I wake up is maintained for some time and then my innocence my wife poem this has destroyed when I going to sleep and then I going to dream the dream is Born the dream has maintained for some time and then the dream is destroyed I go into deep sleep right my state of deep sleep is born is maintained for some time and then that state is destroyed and now I'm awake again
 this but in those states of awareness don't exist in separation from
self the conscious Soul that's experiencing of States so the fact that those dates are there means I'm the one
 that's experiencing that was telling me understand it's a way of analyzing who I am I'm that Witness
 this is in the in the purport probably says this even though one may artificially think himself a liberated or material contamination if he has not taken shelter of the Lord's Lotus feet is intelligence is polluted
 I was thinking how like there's so many times you get to a place in your life where you think I am so above all of this I'm so above all of this and all of that becomes in one sense is beautiful for now and then at any moment you can just switch back to you could become exactly what you hated if not worse than what you hated but it's taking shelter of Krishna at every moment
that type of humility it's not due to some diet or health regime or something like that that makes a conscious is pure ultimately comes from surrender to Krishna and all of the purity of the mind will naturally follow that he's referring to really important verse in the Bible time content can't tell ye and ye were induction of them looked mighty nice it's saying that this this experience of feeling on liberated feel like I am I am the one Divine Light
 it's a very profound feeling
 but it's not an actual an absolutely clear perception because it it it
 it's ultimately to stay where I'm thinking I've lost touch with the truth that I am an individual and so it's maintained only for some time
and then you come down from that state which is really interesting point because so much of the earlier texts like an opana shot seem to be pointing to that is the ultimate right Bob what I'm saying that's actually not the ultimate ultimate is divine love it it's so much higher than just being engrossed material activities but yeah when the big zoom out is that even that liberation
 is coming from a gift of Krishna who's the source of these the Lord of The Lord of Liberation in the same way a child a teenager can feel like wow I'm driving I got my own car I'm free I can go anywhere I want you know but now you got your mom's credit card that's your dad bought you the car you're at mom's paying for the insurance in that car if it feels like you're free but you're actually completely dependent is also a type of Illusion that you're in here and you know there's this part of the comments are here probably says the soul is
from the body
 this is a Roma's or distinct from the material vehicle vehicle in which they are carried namely the air
 the soul is unattached to material activities like another was all that I do with my body and all that I go through my life and wants my soul is just kind of pink it's just it's just passing by my soul it's all just kind of going across my soul and it just we go through Lifetime and lifetime of these experiences just passing over us like like in the sky the sky is there different types of clouds and birds and toner passing through it but it always stays there and so then he says this analysis can be considered
 can I see what he says considered I think it can be understood it can be perceived by person was fully under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord is his this is confirmed in the Vatican Junction Jasmine V got a Tsar bomb
this is why I look this one up
 this is from the Appalachian maduko punishment and it says
 it's it's the it's shaunika it's a shaunika great householder approached under Asa
 and asked your Sage knowing what
 does all become known like what is it what what object of knowledge when you understand that one object you understand everything so probably saying if if we if we understand Christian if we understand that Supreme Being behind everything we can understand oh I get it these different states that I go through or temporary on the spark of Eternal energy which is a spark of Christians energy and I have an internal connection with that spark like the Rays of the Sun have with the sun itself so
 This Is War
call going in in a commentary to that
 I forget who said this but I got out of town and my notes are just is one knows all things made of clay
 by knowing a piece of clay
 I want to know all the facts by knowing the special spiritual object
 in other words if we can understand Krishna who becomes Vishnu
 who enters into the material realm and it's all a manifestation of his energy
 and through his power he transforms that energy in different ways that I am one transformation or one aspect of krishna's energy might my own awareness that I'm moving through a material round that's another type of his another transformation of his energy if we understand that one being we understand everything it kind of is it just it all opens up to
I might look at it like a clay pot let's head to know anything about clay right what is this hard thing how did it manifest where did it come from how come it's shaped in a perfectly round shape that seems just suitable for cooking or carrying water something out here is something else made of clay you know it's a clay spoon it's a different thing where did this come from in it does it have a different Source come from the same Source you know if I really know what Clay is I begin to understand everything that's made of clay and if I begin to understand Krishna who everything is just a manifestation of his of his energies then I understand everything I like that I like that I like you too and we're the same thing and yet different
 yeah there for my dear friend
oh sons of demon house
 I think it's 27
 sorry no polluted in through polluted intelligence one is subjected to the modes of Nature and the last one is conditioned by material existence like a dreaming state in which one falsely suffers right and have a dream where you're like one of my crazy Maritime dreams I have the boat is capsizing
 oh God how many times have I dreamt that dream like a dreaming State and which one falsely suffers material existence which is due to ignorance must be considered unwanted
 contemporary OK Google trying to embrace with chili
take photos of the past we put them on our walls and remember recount the good old days
 but here
 sharing like this is material existence it's it is it safe to rinse why why highlight it must be considered unwanted and a tenant in in width if we can understand this with face
 it it's it's it's just asking us to stretch our minds for sure right it's asking us to it saying in a sense the way it speaks to me or think the way my speaks the most of us
 is like hello sister hello brother. You've been moving through life as if this is the one reality
 and what we're trying to help you understand is that there's even true reality beyond the experience that we're going through right now you could even say that will we're living through right now it's kind of like
can you can you can get glimpses of this it in our Modern World by looking at video games are virtual realities or different things that you could just looking back at your life looking back at your last relationship and how it seemed so lasting and permanent and real and now when you think about it if you'd ever been married before I had a girlfriend or boyfriend before would you look back at it it almost seems like a dream sometimes even your dreams seem more real than our past relationships and it seems that way because it is that way it actually is dream like that says remember we remember grandparents that have passed by pasta way we don't want to say that they're nothing or there apparitions but
 of of their form that form is temporary and in that in that sense the dream is temporary also and therefore to invest that much
love hate attachment to a dream is it is silly it's like investing your love in the Titanic movie and crying when the ship goes down it's a movie love can't be joined eternally now it's a movie there they weren't even real people
 yeah it sometimes children see something
 that traumatize them into end of movie say sure your parents let you know now they can't let it go away and so send me this versus saying this our existence in this world is something like a bad dream like a dreaming State and which one falsely suffers does nothing really there's nothing ultimately real happening or suffering because of our identification with it for material existence which is due to ignorance must be considered unwanted in temporary just like a bad dream is
wanted and it's temporary if we if we can grass this we can move through this world unchanged by the externals like with a steadiness and then tap into our real nature underneath which is actually steady and very blissful
 you know it's like we find our joy and lamentation for the past isn't it peculiar as a musician and a person who puts out old CDs and records and stuff like that I got to this point in my life or like I'm going to stop even collecting my own records because it's sort of like what am I going to do with all this stuff I'm just going to store them go back and look through them is I get it's like how many people have basements filled with this is my in a 45 year old son's you know artwork from when he was 5 years old and this is a minute it's nice for a moment it's just it's like
remembering dreams almost
 yeah it almost becomes a little exhausting almost becomes a little futile and it's it's like how many of these relics can I save and what am I actually getting out of it anyway don't get me wrong I like pictures on the wall of family and things like that and I'm not trying to be heartless here for the same time I think when a devotee looks at pictures of their family on the wall I see it a little bit differently I do it there is a type of romance remember when it was like that and by the way we tend to forget the pain we tend to remember all those Rosy but you also see how elf forms change
 what the hell you can look at those photographs with a spiritual vision and you can actually sharpen your spiritual eye for seeing the change of forms
 well we're going to swear at a time is so much more to say but then I'll pick it up tomorrow yeah
