in the shelter for the shelter song fucked Avatar shelter the song with shelter
 how to buy the band shelter and we're playing in New York City and you just see this devoted get up he's like he's kind of have a dude in the sense that light is it just kind of hunched over you know he's not you not like he kind of walks around like a little bent over you know they spent these but he's been buddies could sweetest heart and a manicure time he's dancing and spinning around like crazy until right when they brought that you started rolling I just started dancing with abandon bit and he just and then he just showed up and we just we just fell into each other's arms. I really did I said the fact that this person is just shown up been in
brace me we're just going to dance the whole way that you do and and I just felt access he danced around he's one of those guys like if you get into the class just circles you're like is this guy crazy or is he actually not of the show starts ever been to be sitting down I'll be standing up and just spinning around and spinning around and spinning around like you're not familiar with kirtan if you like this guy doing it's always in a type of spiritual axis and I never seen him not happy and excited and Suites in Humble hog me twice yesterday
 am I right that these are nothing but appreciation yesterday about it
which was text 43 okay so this verse is so we're hearing from this another Abba doot this person is just lying on the ground but he's got all these deep realizations about life and he's going to get an interview by a prolonged Mars what are you all about and what kind of spiritual things you have going on here I am you know and he and he we were talking last week that his he kind of learned from the python that I don't end ever too much for external material things a python it doesn't go out and hunt it doesn't eat every day it'll Island spot and it kind of accepts what he gets and so that principle of accepting what we get in life
 is is a lot of the message of what he's sharing any saying in order to do that you got to you got to kind of transcend something that's like the most common thing in the world and that is that we tend to judge this is good this is bad I need to get the
I need to avoid the bad in in in this is how we live life pursuing what a mind has been programmed except as good trying to avoid what a mind is programmed is bad or light becomes an Endeavor you know bouncing between those is that I don't even I kind of in it Danny said you said this he said the mental concoction of discrimination between good and bad
 can we not talking about good and bad behavior you know like a good and evil or you know we're not talking morals here we're just saying like that body is attractive that one isn't you know that that that that's the job that we need that one is just like or that person they said something about me they're bad this person said some about me they're good I don't see bad and good anymore and so it's just the mental concoction of discrimination between good and bad should be accepted as one unit
 it's just a type of illusory discrimination I just put it all in one bag
and then it should be invested in the mind the Manas we should then be invested in the false ego
 the programming your mind is on these two levels one my mind is programmed to think this will please me and this won't
 and to my mind has been programmed to say this is who I am I'm am an American I missing that are based on the body so saying you take both of these you're you're good and bad discrimination put in one bag then needs you invested in the ego and then you take the false ego should be invested in the total material energy Sue just sent all of that stuff is not me
 I have nothing to do with all of this thinking good and bad I want to say with no I don't want that this is Pleasant this is unpleasant you know there's a verse in the bug of agita
 was each of the racist remove Tanner from the Mohan abarta that everyone is running around this world is bewildered by Duality is Arisen from you can say attraction repulsion
I hate but I think attraction of ocean I like those words I'm really want this I hate this you know that that's the confused State Amor Amor someone seeing deeper like this python man he's saying that it has nothing to do with who I am and so he gives up the butt he says that this is the process of fighting false discrimination so now from that point he can be introspective he can think about life you can think about the self and now we hear today's first Grandma some of the chapters just three more versus I very often so stupid when we hear about religion it is praying for stuff that will make my life easier for the pain to go away rain for healing spring for abundance Frankford good good life
 it's never sort of only inbox you here oh what the calamities,
and again it's like what this isn't religion religion prays for the good of all the bad but inbox you hear the the bad is actually often times better than the pad for self-realization something that's beyond Transcendence 2 to the good and bad of the material realm and it's time things are really heading south in our life he's cold seasons of life and some of us may be experiencing it right now
 when you're in one of these darkest seasons of life you should understand this is a special gift
 that you have to springboard off the bottom to go higher it's rapid acceleration there is no bad karma for the Krishna bhakta there's no bad
Karma all it is is an acceleration of your pure emotional service just think of it like that whenever you go down hard you should think Krishna is giving me special Mercy like when you hit the but if you go surfing to get spun around the waves don't know what sometimes you get Propel to the bottom it's when you hit that bottom you can spring off the bottom use that down the California analogy analogy right thing is I'm not going lower I'm only going up use those winter seasons to propel yourself to trampoline yourself forward that's where the growth is
 decorator yeah
 okay text 44
 text Cody poet x 40 v x 44 text Lori pocket text.
thoughtful person must realize that material existence is an illusion
 interesting
 okay this is Possible only by self realization is Shield self-realized person
 a self realize person who's actually seen the truth should retire from all material activities being situated and self realization that doesn't mean you just give up everything that you're doing that this guy did the fox say
 is it I want to just wear this first line of a thoughtful person must realize material existence is an illusion I don't know about the rest of the world cuz I can't enter into their heads but my dreams at night cuz they are so realistic
they're more real than when you wake up it's like it was so real like I had a dream this morning where you know I don't know if you know but we have chickens that are Farm my daughter just got some chickens cuz she lives in the home but I was with the chickens yesterday and some head farmer came up to me and was taken one of the chickens those are what are you doing about chickens and it goes if it doesn't lay it doesn't stay well I woke up and I woke up and I've never heard that crazy Express before I got Swagger to themselves and a unique personality and facial features it's so rare that I wake up and I'm in this world and truthfully now and I'm in this house worth
with these are clients of mine I was thinking yeah I was here and the guy just looked at me to go see how you were here 2020 years ago that's when you were here I was like that's right I was here twenty years ago it seems like a moment ago our life isn't like series of chapters and as you standing in the final chapters of live you start to look back and say it seems like a moment I was here a moment ago it really seen as you get older it just seems even more like a moment ago
 it's an illusion man you want to read some of this commentary for commentary by Sheila Pro pod by analytical study of the entire constitution of the body one can surely come to the conclusion that the soul is different from all the bodies material constituents such as Earth and water fire and air right that's what are bodies made of
maybe if people argue and I argue this one for the devoted
 will you say there's fire in my body and he said yeah where is there fire the body is heatness a type of fire at his house your body warm as your body so it's not like a campfire sound like a Boy Scout campfire in like two little boy scouts in my tummy right but there's a heat in the fire that's what it means to radiant radiant energy the scientist who caught us the difference between the body and the Soul can you realize why a person who's Lilith awful municipal or money after this realization of the individual Spirit Soul one can easily understand the Supreme Spirit Soul if one of us realizes that the individual soul is subordinate to the supreme Supreme spiritual you Chief self-realization so is this is this simple progression probably just going to take us by the hand right
 because of the verse said
that okay with this material existence is involution what kind of confused too kind of Trapped in it and the person has to realize this and this is Possible only by self-realization so that means I need to realize who I am what I am I'm not in Supreme States begins with understand that you're not your body right and if you can realize that you're not your body then you realize okay there's the body and then there's me the soul and if you could realize that you're just a little step away from realizing that there's another Soul they know that that's kind of behind everything there's another you know if within my body there's a soul well within this universe there's a soul that makes it all come like if I'm if I'm the the spark of spirit that makes this body come alive then it must be a spark of spirit that makes the universe come alive and that if you can just understand that you had hit uses the word that you know we don't like that you know what triggers a trigger to the Westminster board in it
subordinate what is the word ordinate mean subordinate to be interested to find out you know that I think when we hear that it has an immediate negative, connotation your minds by should I submit to anyone
 subordinate if we can just
 maybe isn't the definition you're looking for the Cartesian coordinate of Pain by measuring parallel to the y-axis so that means we're just like located okay yeah it's a lower I guess sub with me in lower right on a ladder you know of our Universal influence we're on a lower Peg and since you know course there's more invitation that that the laws are kind of established by the
 will be the opposite of subordinate them
 my blood meaning
as opposed to self would be the opposite of bored we fix prefix like higher ordinate any case that yes you know that the higher is the being with the higher status is kind of providing you know and including providing you know the laws you know the programming of the universe ever moving through you a superordinate that's the word situated yeah but if you do I was just thinking that you know someone asked me a question and then you and I think yesterday to this dump you
 you know like when you're on that beach you know there's always liked these Venice Beach like there's always some you know crazy characters their you know how they taken and if they all just want it all the theological philosophical discussion I just want to get right in there
doesn't matter they live under the Boardwalk set up a table of Art and so you know what about the pygmies I'm sorry I don't know very much about who's at the Q and A table oh yeah I mean there's a big crowd is a few people like that you know that is just kind of like taking it in the artist to like
 honor them without getting sidetracked and if so do you know what I heard it was a lottery what the hell you talkin about it but any case someone asked was
 what
is the consequence if you don't believe in reincarnation
 what is it l and so we just kind of went through it or or what does it lead to if you do believe in reincarnation
 and as we just started talking about all the units kind of together we were just kind of saw that like just the idea that I'm not my body that that that this body is made out of matter and I made out of something different all that that opens you up to
 it just opens up everything you know that on a spiritual level even on the Practical level of how we coexist with one another you know it is is so much facilitated
 by that simple real estate because if I'm not my body
 that means all that I'm identifying with it and then we can go do not like for you and I like male American Etc we realize that none of those things are true
but that's not actually who I am now how does that affect how I relate to other people well it means they're not the categories that these temporary material categories either yeah we're all something Beyond these temporary material categories that divide us is who do we what do we meditate on the most cuz everything in this world is a meditation generally we meditate on things or people that we hate what is the desire in the hate I hate a Republican or a Democrat because I'm one of the other side whatever you're meditating on or you hate blacks or whites right you become that that's your meditation or meditating on them all the time you thinking of them all the time even comes to was thinking of Christian all the time
that that's what he was saying was that in that previous verse you saying you take it off you put it in one bag and you offered into the material energy right like all my falls conceptions about who I am all of my false conception about what I need I just put it in one bag and I and I said that and I and I throw like into the fire the material energy I said that's not me and from that point on if you can if you can achieve that then you're seeing every want you seen yourself and you're seeing everyone on the platform of equality of the platform of Eternity you're you're you're letting go of your fear you letting go of your anxiety how can how can we exist peacefully with one another not be at war with one another if we
 are not convinced that we're all Transcendent and and we're not these categories sooner in the media that you're like
I hate these people meditate meditate on them as pure Spirit Souls get rid of all your hate for them then when you see someone like oh she's really sexy or he's really good-looking or I'd like to be with him or her see them as a pure Spirit Soul not as the body that is there in a what you're attracted to in them to their peers. So they're going to get whatever you're attracted to is going to get old and grotesque but there's something more than that I guess what your queue and egg guy was meditating on pygmies right thinking about pygmies maybe all day all day and I'll be certain to Q&A Booth what about the pygmies what about the today
 for this I just
I I just were talking about gratitude I'm just so grateful to she'll probably he came
 and he was bringing bhakti to the Western World right that was his mission he was so brilliant how we did it because there's this incredibly beautiful esoteric theology to it
 but he didn't that wasn't the reason start the hair he said no no no we need to go back to the fundamental teachings that right that we're not these bodies then we are sparks of Eternal spiritual energy that we're moving through world made of material energy that we become confused about what we need and what we want because we're identifying with matter he started there and that's actually the platform where you can pull all these different religions and spiritual Traditions Traditions together United on that platform you just United on that platform it's it's really provides you know it really in his seven purposes of the international Society for Krishna Consciousness right
 if I can pull that up
the very first one he says it's to systematically I think it's the systematically train maybe Mary can pull that up she said she then did she disappear in America
 I'm a little while today purposes
 syscon there we go
 other than that she's on it I got it to systematically propagate spiritual knowledge right this is what we talked about what we're not the body where Spark of spiritual energy analyze it break it down what we're doing today yeah to to systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to Society at large and educate people in the techniques of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance of values in life and Achieve real unity and peace in the world it's it's it's you know it exists on the basis of that understanding and it's such a powerful force just understanding that simple I do the body's is a vehicle on the soul
they've got the same thing that you were you and I have been take me and we maybe in the future yeah it's a fact that's what about the picnic what about the big race is nothing in these that's what I should have said I said you were going to pick me and me too and that's what I should have said okay you want to see you if wanted us realizes yeah. It was a session as explained in the 13 chapter the bug of agita but there are two Souls within the body
 the body is called a chaitra and there are two shapes are numbers of the shapes right or occupants of the body namely the Harem of other Super Soul any individual saw the Super Soul and the individual soul
two birds sitting on the same tree tree is the material body one bread the individual so forgetful for today don't be a forgetful bird one bird the individual soul is it forgetful he is eating the fruit of the tree not caring for the instructions of the other bird which is only a witness to the activities of the first bird who is his friend because let's let's just sit so it's saying that we're like the bird that's trying to taste the rosilio bird in the tree next to a try to tell us stuff we're just not listening really interested sometimes a fruit is sweet sometimes if fruit is bitter in the fruit and going through ups and downs in life meanwhile depart mom is right there in the same ol hard with us waiting UniFirst it is a friend just patiently waiting for it to turn back on the forgetful bird will never forget
comes to understand the Supreme friend who is always with with him and trying to give him guidance in different bodies he takes shelter at the Lotus speed of the Supreme Bird Big Bird Big Bird as explained in the process I got a knot Melissa Ashanti Yum Yogurt actually becomes a yogi by meditation you can see the Supreme friend and surrender unto him this is the beginning of bhakti yoga or actual life in Krishna consciousness
 I'm tired
 okay
 text Mi Amor text okay this is the Brits the king Ballade no longer little boy that was walking around the Pearl
of this is other than the king you are certainly a self realize soul and a devotee of the Supreme Lord you do not care for public opinion or so-called scriptures for this reason I've described to you without hesitation the history of my self-realization so he's saying
 you're seeing clear right and he's Dimensions two things you don't care for public opinion will that's a big one because a lot of the times of things that we do in this world are to appease other people sometimes we even go to the university not cuz we want to but because we feel like we should and you know I think my parents are going to be disappointed if I don't get this job I really would like to do this but my parents told me not to do this and often times we are so attached to the public opinions of others and how we dress
we present ourselves in our career and in our choice of a partner that we never check in with
 us like a light check in with like what do I actually want to do in this world what am I actually here for isn't there something more to life than what is the put out the set out before me and you know whenever we hear like the stories that we have whether they're fictional or or like real life stories of Heroes and heroism yeah you know Jerry, that they'll be an element where that person
 has to strike out on their own against the opinions of others right like have the courage to step up and do something that we're having everyone's looking at them saying what the hell are you doing alright get laid off every has to be a millionaire failures before they move forward and end
 it may not be that we all
 will be like
Rose in the sense that like will be famous
 but even in small ways ways that we can act heroically in our own life you know we're in other words we're rather than cave
 2 and therefore remain limited because being limited by the opinions of others cried all they're going to think I'm crazy if I do this they're going to think I'm weird if I do that and then we limit our lives down and we never takes a few irrelevant courageous steps in life that make all the difference you know we were talking the other day when we were at the video going to send you know for some people it's quite natural you know especially if you're doing like in your hometown is in the go out in the street and I do care time people are going to see me and think I've lost it and you know but I think for both you and I you know there's a certain point in your life where it's just like there's not one person in the world that could walk down the street and see me doing this or I'm going to have a problem with it you know yeah
and that's it's then you're actually free and sometimes you look at people even like as a kid you look back in your own life and you see where you weren't able to do that and other people were you know if I go out with that person was kind of evolved you know that they were able to do just the one says be themselves or do what they think is is right or Progressive you know about caring about public opinion so does a big deal sure you know when we get into this especially you and me back then I tell you it's a real Harry Krishna 2.0 now it's it's such a whole different movement in the mood but you and I joined but when we got into boxing immediately if you were a boy you put on an Indian rope so I remember Walking Dead on Spring Street in New York turning the corner and bumping right into Vinnie stigma
he's kind of like meeting a combination of Arthur Fonzarelli and someone even more like full-on do you know ya with a mohawk companion walk around town to Doty in the neighborhood you're friends with everybody and sex after another one after another
 yeah
 set so he's saying he provided even he's kind of so much in the public eye this person saying yourself what you're certainly sell for Lysol and it will just bring what you do not care for public opinion or so-called scriptures
no call scriptures I think he means it can be making mean just other kind of literature that people take seriously right other messages the messages that are being that the messages that are being propagated in in whatever form it a lot of scriptures or in this culture treat her like a self-help book
 you're not getting the whole you're not getting the whole picture is like me handing your carburetor to hear you go run with this carburetor get you going to see it in boxing in the street by the time you're taking all facets of life and putting it in context you're putting success in contacts you're putting failure in contacts and then you can see a much broader idea of what the actual engine does it know so yeah so when you zoom out and see the back of a time as this is where all this stuff is going all these basic teachings with her Tire
or dance or you know philosophy or Sanskrit or all these Vedic Arts they're all meant to bring us to one particular place and that's the Deep spiritual love and connection
 and then he says this right you said okay so you're not confused by so-called scriptures in other words are you not confused by all these different messages societies putting out there is important to that we should you know any and you're also not concerned about public opinion so therefore you haven't limited yourself you're not going to respond to the things that I share with you with these kind of hackneyed road kind of automatic
 shallow responses
 and services for this reason I've described you without hesitation the history of my self-realization
 so he's a person that's kind of keeping to himself he's not sharing most people don't even get it's not like he's wearing some kind of spiritual outfit or posing and anyway as
spiritual person or what he's not even speaking to other people for the most part he's just kind of lying there and most people looking to him without a clue of who he is and he has no intention of sharing it unless the person if a person's, you need any really good see I did this person can understand he saw and in Pearl on this person he's so sincere
 dad he's he'll be receptive to what I have to share so therefore I'll share it normally I don't even get involved with other people that kind of waste my time break break break my you know get me out of my groove that I'm in you know
 and it's okay but you're you have the ability to understand this because it's just a huge clue it's a clue about the guru disciple relationship and it's a clue about receiving transcendental knowledge you know like what makes us receptive to the knowledge is out there
 we can anyone can pick up a bucket with you to read it but whose life is it going to
games well one way that's going to open us up to it is when we get that courage in life that's that sincerity that urgency in her life I want the truth and even if people think I'm weird that doesn't matter to me. You know I'm I am at that point right even if people think I'm some kind of freak or whatever I don't care for the public opinion and in the public messages that are out there about what is necessarily good or bad I really want that okay if not now you can receive this this message that wouldn't penetrate
 I'm at Spurs last first ready
 nothing instructions from you understood the occupation
duties of the perfect person that's he duly worship the Saints and took his permission and the left for his home to take your permission you say I'm going to leave that I do I have your blessings to leave and you know his race is sweet culture you know I was feeling that all left and right yesterday you were feeling it's a moment when some guy goes you didn't sit in a nice way it was a little bit challenging but not like what are you waiting for the damn pygmies purple was speaking in the booth before me I really and that's why we came in after me who your garage Swami
 but you know.
connecting with you and with them on my way in in my way out of that service was special
 hi you don't we I just saw that kind of culture that kind of respect here is a lot easier King
 and he's talking to a person is just lying in the dirt apparently doing nothing it's kind of like Polar Opposites from a material perspective on the street and they are devotees yeah and then you would think if anything would be the other way that the deaths to person will be bowing down and show respect to the king that they can is saying he's bound on him he says he worships him I don't know exactly what that look like you know and then he asked his permission with your permission may now move on to the to my duties and IPS you do go ahead and text like he want all of that
 is kind of like gum
 it just like you know you're you're a part-time.
you're going to part-time and so but your knowledge is complete so just like when you permit being a plan a plan into the ground you know the certain considerations to make it work right you know it for it to take root and grow iol summershade yeah I think even like you don't like repaid your plants like during the winter is that correctly like he worked at times of take a half-day times a year do you know and then after that
 it's his part-time knowledge is it to repot the plants at think she said the problem is that November or spring
when in when they're dormant in a case a seed is planted and then they're careful considerations about the conditions that will allow it to grow we talked about this you know we have we have some good stuff to post from the past weekend on the circle platform that will that will be I do you do on our subscribers platform that will get to the coming days but one thing we're talking about it's like in one sense. He's such a simple process cuz you just connect would like to say the Holy Name which is just this powerful source of energy or the bottom of how much is a pound of these are these are like electric currents of spiritual energy when the Mind becomes absorbed them it just transformed the mind but in order for it to be effective
 it requires the right conceptions
 your favorable conceptions a favorable sentiments in a favorable lifestyle and what provide is demonstrating here is like the favorable sent to me
right for what he just shared knowledge with me in a bar just say like things and walk off that knowledge is going to be planted in the heart and mind and grow you know but it'll grow with the right sentiments answer there for you too so respectful and how he deals with this with this person even though other people might be looking at what the hell is this our King is bound down to the chi like you didn't care for that public opinion he's recognized it and spiritual truth is coming through the that is Gru really right there's a principle of group doesn't matter who it's coming through it's the same principle you can work two different people he's recognized its work it through this Skyline on the ground I'm going to show him to do respect and I'm going to request his permission to move on head even though I'm the king that's what a verbal sentiments that allow that knowledge I shared to grow take root in it
 here's here's one I like what other people think of me is none of my business
what's my business is my business
