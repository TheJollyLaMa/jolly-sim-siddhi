and one day in my in my office I stood for the Development Bank of Singapore a software consultant weekend you said hi Krishna Mission I said what is that they give this food this is a co-worker telling you this, or was he started and little did I know I know how to change my life get you with the food don't think us to the Putnam going to the ignition can still get that introduction to chili Paul Potts books in his presentation but he was dead

 okay and the urgency of it the clarity of it that soccer
 no video from goal of life is
 comes the heart get rid of it has been understood that and became very serious working though I'm still working and then I got a job Audioslave I got a job in Singapore you have a religious mother but you you went to University you did all the things like the mother wants our kids
okay then it went away they have a job in Singapore if I got the job in New York now you become a monk does your mother lose her mind at this point or is she supporting you rallying behind you and Shelly she resisted strongly resisted she's waiting for the grandchildren she's waiting for the grass so probably not really asked me know what made me giving up my but it looked at a job in Hemet life New York City I can't even tell you one more time
 okay we can skip skip
 I'm sorry say that again do you want me to tell you what made me become a more giving up my charge but we can't give up anyting we have nothing to give up you actually
gave up a position that you worked hard for for maybe a decade education the resources that probably is studied to get into the school's your entire childhood going to be walked away from it what was the story 2001 March one day I open the New York Times newspaper and I know I read this article Ronald Reagan fell in the bathroom and broke his hip and pray for my husband the former first lady was requesting so does the first time I know I talked with myself if I go to the hospital and tell him you're a Hollywood star
 find a kid's means what it was so much money name and and the sentence in German. And the one thing was missing for you.
then you got the cleats are also two times California download to text Megan president of the most powerful person in the planet in days and today you're going to the suffering you forget about how much I injured previous years it will not compensated today's free and so on in the late 19th century 1912 so bodies and Mission it does 206 bones blood flesh and Metal
 so what you are not the body does the first lesson of Geeta I came to America sow to make money 30-40 years later water is going through today now I'll go through the time how much would a woman have in the bank the name and
the position all the sentiment for the years it has not come from said that suffering Humanity has the Nord age
 when the body starts going through suffering you cannot tell you and your previous years because the kids and let me let you know let me suffer now. By the time I came to America the tell me you're not the body respiratory so I told myself why don't they do research why don't they dedicate my life to do the steps and through the whole another body parts for it so everyone around me that identifying with the designations of a man I'm an engineer and I talked to him the professor might not be either I'm with all the money I have I'm not hip something is missing in my life. Why not I
dedicate my life to propagate this truth and the find some happiness and Solace and peace there so probably a year later I make my girl and I became a monk never look back at like austerity that he put in and study and go to the gang getting all those degrees and hit all of that this power that comes in that it's just all become invested in the service is a monkey he's like a Greek I like hundreds and hundreds of people that are just like you know he looks very quiet and unassuming but you can just hear from his words that he was speaking right now he's got realization you knows how to presented and it really touches people I want to I want to move on because you put together a series of books
 got it right here right did the Art and Science of self-mastery amongst wisdom for personal fulfillment and professional achievement run. This is what we need we need to read this okay I need a
play Demons by your material side with nothing to speak of your spiritual side you material material side is quite impressive it is set so this this is a series of three books that come together in one package has to do with Stress Management
 one has to do with anger management okay I need that one and other is time management regular I need that one too I think the main thing I'm so it's so you'll Kishore from can you tell us a bit about the about the series of books
 yeah it's the first lesson of Youth as I said before you're not the body but the spirit song
 attachment causes stress asking monks handling projects literally tens and twenties and thirties hundreds of projects have not seen them stress.
I want to create a noun. I want make everyone know if you what causes stress expectation and reality reality is different the distance if there's a vast distance between your expectation and utility reality I want to I want to leave it this
 this gun I don't delete this with my girlfriend
 16th to the aspect of living with her or him everything that you said since you started this is what we're going to be involved with time today you know where we're at the point where that you know the prolonged Mirage meets the python man you know who's lying down it's like it's straight out like this stress you got right to the heart of the matter
when your in able to handle the stress attachment leads to anger you something but the reality is different so when you're stressed out it leads to anger and when you're stressed out with stress and dirt listen to anger you don't know. I know the time it's all connected doctor to read these books but probably not past 22 years have been traveling cultivating all this software professionals doctors in this in this book actually yeah so I want to tell people I know don't actually David understanding and reasonable emotion and there's not a normal emotion weather
control and controlled medications so I want to destruction in scientific mold and stress analysis speaking without even taking medicine if you realize this problems at the very earliest age by reading those books you can address all the three things there are clear they're simple to not like it's it's deep Bud like presented in a simple way a little bit like a workbook to like there's at the end of chapters that gives you little place to reflect and write some things down and why you know this practical like that where can people find your book is it on your website and they can go to google.com google yugal Kishore Kishore.com fantastic that's perfect I'll put the link in

 and your heart people speak highly about you because of your heart's more than your knowledge
very grateful very grateful to be I love to be today thank you thank you thank you
 I've said it before and I'll say it again thank you Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan had in this lifetime is a Hollywood guy and I like we can't even imagine the type of sense gratification opportunities percents gratification dolgins in the senses just from that position then all the sudden you become the leader of the Free World get arrested person was he was the governor governor of California
 Yang 10 president or I can think of is like Arnold Schwarzenegger that's the only other person I could think was but should have been up there it is that type of like that type of like material Fame notoriety and he's different because he's got the body and
type of other sense gratification whenever was checking out your body you know what I mean okay I can enjoy the ticket Ronald Reagan was considered very handsome man in his acting gay so it was Arnold so they're both in the same category I'm just so I'm saying that besides Ronald Reagan I can only think of like Arnold Schwarzenegger who's been up there that's the only had two men that you you know of well with that type of powers the governor of California he was like the Medela Pumping Iron movie about him what about Kennedy
 and he was up there to see wasn't he wasn't a celebrity and is used you know some people have money but they don't have Fame ever meet people like that money but no family is a different type of money
set up a pleasure I've seen it I've seen that happen like they want to be in a rock band but they're they're rich but they can't they don't have that Fame yeah and then there's people of our sites for the famous got no money because they don't know how to spend it they need that they need money management that's how you know everything he was taught what we're going to read today but what I appreciate it he was he was in a position where he's making good money you make that kind of money you can go back to Indian like live like a king you make that type of money go back to India you could live like a live like a yeah but he put us rather than that warping his perception right I was just what's going to happen to most people in one degree or another
 rather he even though he was situated in that service that he was observing the nature of material in German looking
that's what it was it was just it was just his observing they wasn't like I fell in the bathtub and got hurt it was he was noticing other if we can learn from other people's pitfalls yeah that's where we've become very very powerful this this idea of observing the nature of material enjoyment cuz usually just get caught up in it we need to take a step back we need to preserve it and observe it like how would the whole thing plays out and if you deserve it carefully you'll see that the false promise
 this is why I ran into Ronnie's running Swami's instructions to me very powerful even say. This is what I want you to do this year I want you to walk in the forest so down and think about life black about material existence it's imported a journal about materials
notice but yours has to see where you're going see where your desires see how they match up but all lines up how it lines up reflect zoom out of zoom out of your life see where you went to say we were talking before the show you're talking to you and me are friends in 2020 to 2001 we are friends back then friends that was like a whole chapter of my life gone we're still friends and where you were then is disappeared disappeared but if you were to take that away that was before all of it and we were still friends and time just marches on your you're you are you are you gone through a whole we all have these little fantasies about what her life will be and how to work out and so on it
assured by material nature are Lana and one says we all go through almost the same thing in certain ways even if it appears very different yeah very similar as different as we are isn't it too much detail about is do but like you know there's certain things that like humans go through like you talked about a lot about like what it's like to be a parent and and and that you just can't make your children do what you feel is best for them because they have their own independence and there's you know it inhuman, and then even where you are maybe misunderstood and I don't have any children but in certain relationships I thought the same thing you know ya like I'm I'm here to help just accept it cuz I want to step in if you know you feel that like I know what's good for you just hear me out here is like a liar
you know I just surrender surrender surrender to you and what I'm supposed to do for a ah that is a Krishna conscious parampara that I represent surrender to that older than me I know there for three weeks though three weeks is a long time everything that he said is that I love when these Christian miracles happen by Myra
 right in the mess with the Enderman dragon about the Monday them satisfied him be assembled before starting to see my daughter, which is every means of Conquest when should I expect the base and see his do the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan recu the super most human being but some other sarswati the goddess of learning
and she'll be off today the author not stopped by a show about race unity and rendering Services a devotees all that is troublesome to the heart because of Raticate & and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh My Gana camera opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet
 reading from Reading from Canto seven chapter 13 text 26 you know what I like a great is not a great phrase truth is we are born down darkness of ignorance lost bumping into walls falling into
it's making the same mistakes again and again and don't know what to eat don't know what you had a brave and I don't know what to think about letting our senses lead us Vedic beings I have no Hindu mother dragged me to the
 we are walking around ride my bicycle around like a kid getting into trouble cultivating lust and greed from childhood playing out of all the material enjoyment what we're hearing today from again. Who was king at the time by project grown man I'm pretty sure by this yeah he's hard to think of him as a grown man but I always try to think of this child. But he's a grown man at this point any
he's honest Mission I want to walk around you know he's got a lot of responsibility but he's like I need to set aside some time to just go on a mission to travel around and try to seek out people that have deep wisdom for many find this man like this is like a Monty Python movie or something like that like you said it's on but it's like a Monty Python film the sense of like he's like lying on the ground like not even moving but he's like going to going up in interviewing him in like what you got to say it and the first thing you do is just you know he looks dirty
 he easy seems lazy maybe or maybe he's a little crazy
 but first thing he does is he begins in in and he says you know pretty much everybody's walking by me they don't get where I'm at internally but you picked right up and you know why you picked up on it because you're engaged in cable a body
adult rated pure Bucky Christmas in your heart he's become the primary feature in your heart and he's instructing you hey there's a guy over there and talk to him answer your phone I can look into a person's exactly where they're at right and so he spends a few verses just glorified as a respectful refined person he doesn't look like we're a fine person and he looks like a crazy lazy person but no he begins just to glorify provide first thing right he did this is like a widow of a person that's got refined sensibilities and behavior does she spends little time glorifying now it begins to drop the knowledge truck right now and he begins by saying you know cuz it's kind of what are you doing lying here on the ground
 first couple versus have to do with this I preserved US World looked into it
 and then I withdrew
 got the same thing you will cuz your booty butt in a different
observed
 sussed it out sister that doesn't look like a promising return on investment Can I with your old world and I went through the ROI nice rug money man's got men and women unite for sensual pleasure of sex but by actual experience we have observed that
 is a promise is a promise anyway going to get up there for seeing the country results
 right noticing this I have stopped taking part in the tearless to activities
I'm a true that's what's driving them that's was that if that's what they're doing that's what's driving them for pleasure is pleasure of the body is like there's got to be more than this yeah exactly you know he says the Tropicana
 he took some of his transcendental license to kind of like rain it exactly as he did but he brought it he brought it cuz really just as men and women all right it says like they're a man in their women and they're searching for happiness proper kind of sitting at let's let's ride on that's it doesn't say that in the text you no like I let me see if I can pull up another translation of it here for you I mean that's another translation this is the reason why we go to the toilet taken to this is the reason why we want to make money this is the reason why we call more hair this is the reason why
the stupid shaves his head this is the reason why I grow a beard we are we want people to think somewhere I shave my head in there but this is another chance that she never seen the suffering of men and women from performing actions meant for removing misery and creating happiness we can read between the lines I have become detached from all actions
 yeah but we can probably read between the it and he brought it to that kind of to that come together for sex that that's what we wait we have extra that they've been in this contact between the female energy in the mail this is really important we see the you know female energy meets male energy we look at that and we think that's where the most enjoyment lies that's for me to find my hat this I promise there that that's what I'm going to find my happiness in life well there is that is where the most enjoyment last
but but but but but we don't understand is that the way that the material energy works
 is that with all the happiness comes just as much distress it's like you can't take one side of the coin without the other will for sure so when I die if I could just read my mind that I'll do it better I can get a better okay okay we enjoyed we had sex now if I can refine it how can I find sex Pegasus know his ways you can think of refining it may be through 100 practices or semen retention practices or wigs or examples
 take take it easy. We lost him are we lost him ideas if we can refine
navigate to your weird or funny or more shot Vic whatever it's still as you're through the Sensual Body likes and the problem with that is that's my go-to that's my gold standard for happiness and that's a problem is fool's gold it doesn't give with the soul want that because we're actually Spiritual Beings we're not sexual beings we like the fit yet you get some pleasure through the senses such pleasures and then end I do not Delight in them I'm going to blow your mind next verse but let's hold on to that for now I'm going to blow your mind it has to be getting an end of so those were wise want something more than an inch so much complication cuz it's not that here's my point so that it's it's natural that we fall into the Trap
 unless were observant unless
some people have been deeply observant it's natural that we found it to the Traverse they look after all the material enjoyment lies at its highest point right right there yeah
 keep it together and I keep it together keep it together keep it together
 he's losing right now here's my point right now it's natural that we look at the connection the male energy the female energy Magic ascended to come together what we really should be thinking is what other good comes between comes from this connection between masculine energy and feminine energy what is it really meant for because it's actually is a very powerful combination why do we look at it in just think sense enjoyment why don't we look at the two and think how the two work together for the for the upliftment of everyone that's the way a wise person is taking
how did these two energies meet in such a way where everyone benefits in a real way you know I recently saw something it was like this you know that
 television show The View
 the video you're watching The View lately I wasn't watching The View I saw a clip from it and and one of the people on The View is in for those that don't know that you would like these it's a group of ladies five ladies just like yeah panaway happened what I hate spilling from the Buick there was a lot of hate and then they talked about some experiment of some video where they went around I think it's just like a video another video clip right and it's a video clip to another video clip and and the and the one that they were speaking about this they ask they went around the street last women like do women need men
 and the women were just saying no don't need man menu.
we don't know you probably tell there's a spider in the shower then they said course yes
 and then they asked the panel there is many men are just say many men were saying that the men need women the women were saying we don't need men now I'm not saying that that's the way it always goes with this was a edited film clip and so on but then they turned to the panel and and they said what do you think of it why is that in like one of the women said because men are trash because we don't need them you know it's like just taking this is sad you know it should be obvious to everyone you know that that's the combination of male and female energy it sustains this world that were living in you know what it is and has a each each of them have something to offer to each other and to their children into this world when they come together it can be the most beautiful and Power
and I supported your kind of spiritual energy yet what why do we grow up a little bit stop acting like children do that's the kind of thing I expect from a 6 year old girl to say not a grown woman on a television show that supposed to be helping people see the world better you know what's where they endorsing that view or no no that's what I'm saying the woman on The View said you have to you know the first one said why do you think people spoke this way this video clip and she's at because men are trash you know psych, I do the other the other hosts were saying men are trash the other women on the panel of the the view your my God so it's so why not look at it yesterday like you enhance my Krishna conscious
 I I still have to do what I do without Mara. Mara do you think we're going out this trash know that was Barry
junk is just like its is the media is kind of whether it's social media or television media what is just pushing us to think in these negative thought Loops divisive divisive cruel it's like we think we're better when we put someone else down drop all that look at the male and female energy and see what is unique about each and how can they serve each other and all right so this python man he didn't buy into the material promise that old there's material happiness there find a happiness there he he witnessed it actually I'm seeing if it's causing a lot of complication lot of suffering he withdrew Now text 27 this is a mind-blower rugged on spectrum is a deep text
 the actual form of life for the living entities is one of
spiritual happiness which is real happiness is happiness can be achieved only when one stops all materialistic activities material sense into him and it's simply an imagination right of property uses this phrase a mental concoction
 you're a genius create ideas of happiness and how we will enjoy when I get this when I go there when I acquire this when I get to this level of Fame this level of Economic Development this home this extension on my home this vehicle this particular partner then I will be happy it's all then it's all sometime in the future I will enjoy life but our pleasure is not actually very randomly very very
 yes yes
going great that for a while its first scarcely here and now it's always a hope to enjoy okay and you don't use this one I don't know if you made it up or not but it's like we're Fish Out of Water Fish no matter what you do to them no matter where you want you take them out of the water you can offer them anything of this world right you could you could take me to beautiful places you could take him to when people do forget your food or a sailing could go adventure sports they could go to the theater they could they could go to the countryside they're not interested in anything they're interested in going back to the water why it seems so boring I can offer you so much fun exciting exhilarating things on land you all you do is eat little minnows and bread and worms come on look at all the beautiful food we have to
are you know the fish is most happy when when he's in his natural habitat and that's why we have this spiritual life or Spiritual Beings no matter what the material world offers us were actually joyful connected content when we have a spiritual life running through our bloodstream that's when we find joy and sometimes it doesn't even make sense you know we have these know we have these a joke about it cuz people come to India with me and you know they're actually contentment type of Peace they've never had before and then they tell their partner's back home LOL what are you doing writing up early sitting on the floor singing songs it's like what you doing what that's what you're doing on your vacation days sitting on the floor waking up early who's waking up early on their vacation days but is it is what do you sing in a little Eagles or something like that.
Sanskrit bhajans it makes no sense but we Are Spiritual Beings we find our greatest enjoyment and spiritual activity the whole Krishna Consciousness culture is about creating a culture of spiritual activity so we can be joyful in this place where we don't belong we're not of this world we're visitors of this world and where aliens like Alchemists really is a Taurus and a Leo illegal aliens
 finish this first talk about it I want to break it down to like the 27 for the living entities as one of spiritual happiness which is real happiness is happiness can be achieved only when one stops on the trailers to get activities material sense enjoyment is simply an imagination okay considering the subject matter
beast from all material activities and I'm lying down here
 that's like the Monty Python and that's why I'm just lying here on the ground I don't go anywhere so I got the microphone sanskriti this person. It's it's it's it's really so much comes out of this one so he starts by saying Sue come
 su-kam Asia, no rope on the Oghma Groupon that does the form of the arm of the natural form our natural existence is to come is happiness right that's like we're meant to be feeling happiness all the time when we're not happy it just means we're not in touch with the nature of the opto the nature of the South the nature of the Soul that's he sang I know that that's a fact right that has their butt and then he says he says sarva all of this
activities who para TI just I stopped all material activities will when did you stop the material activities of what made you you know I know that my natural spiritual existence is happiness so I stopped all my my materialistic activities will when did you do that and then and then there's this phrase here uses and this may blow your mind from he says Mahna the Mind needs some sparsha John means like touch or contact
 and some sparsha means like when the two items that are contacting come together right together touching together and John means born born from the touching together right the bulga the happiness enjoyment that's born from when the touch
together takes place he says Drift Fly after after observing this
 the after observing the happiness that's born when the census contacted sense objects right with the courses the tactile sense of touching something but when the eyes touch the object of vision when the ears touch the object of sound observed that when did the happiness it's born of this connection
 between that the objects to the census in the sensors themselves I've observed that that happiness is mono hot it actually all just exists in the mind of the material sense enjoyment is simply imagination at a profit for a sit there now a lot of people say what are you talkin about I I actually enjoy it's not just in my mind I am when I touch the right thing when I taste the right thing when I see the right thing I feel real happiness but this this man lying on the ground he was sitting
he was thinking about it just as you go ashore was like thinking about Ronald Reagan you know and his life and his happiness and so I'd like to give this example of like smoking cigarettes right then now if you give me a cigarette and you say consume smoked this thing there's you'll find it enjoyable absolutely not like this that's the last thing that I want to do is pull the smoke into my body and into my lungs it's got the zero enjoyment as a matter fact I actually find it to be a condition of suffering it's like
 I want to get away from from that cigarette I want to say Get it away right away
 and so but know what they're talking about either Marin's I let no idea what you're going through town now so if you know you know the way
something I did Timothy tiger got SS decontrol that's right thank you so so there are other people in this world that actually feel no I want to smoke that cigarette
 now what's the difference between me and them it has been sold it has nothing to do with our lungs it has nothing to do it it has everything to do with the mind that one mind has been programmed to think that's pleasurable I want that man in my mind is a different program than they say that's actually suffering I don't want that so the enjoyment that's derived from it is actually just a question of the program in this within the mind it has really it's a mental concoction
 and it's it's it's a it's a mental game you know it's it's a it's a it's something that's happening there in the mind just like if I say we're going to ride a jet ski some people
stupid like they're happy even though nothing's happening with some people like fear the water feeder sharks fear in a water accidents and for them they're like no I don't want to ride a jet ski at the last thing I want to do it's all a mental concoction how the brain has been programmed in the past you share the story where you were on tour your band was opening for another like man that had a big head out and they're kind of like high on the charts at the time and in the singer that ban was like this really handsome guy and a hunky guy, hunk and and and he he knew that your you and your band or into like spirituality and Son yeah and it kind of came up to you for some advice just to open up his heart right and what you say
 he said you know he's like I know you guys have this. About controlling your senses and
you know when you were moms are celibate or but it's like girls throw themselves at me and I don't want to I don't even get any pleasure out of it anymore but I just can't stop like I'm an addict so so another words the senses were driving him right continue
 but internally he was like I'm not happy what if I just done like what have I done is like overeating eating a pint of ice cream so what did I just do what was I thinking it's like that fortunately I don't have those problems women don't throw themselves at me but some people have those problems and then they're thinking that there is no great payoff from Indulgence there's only lamentation what have I done so this python Manor
