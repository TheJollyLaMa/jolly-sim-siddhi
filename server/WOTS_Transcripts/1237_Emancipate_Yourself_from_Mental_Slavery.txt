 okay
 thank you Mara now we have the Nugget recognize move on to the Nugget and it's Robert Nesta Marley otherwise known as Bob Marley
 I meant I'm going to read you scrub my face and this by no no no I'm going to I want to read stuff from him just going to touch her heart melt your heart and make you a fan for like a talking in the message board now I'm defensive
now I know but now I'm going to I'm going to break through that or what are you doing you got it I got it right here in corrupt you you're corrupted already Bob Marley
 and I think about that to get into something and corrupt your car up there already to your current defeat our whole idea of bad Association
 how do you say nice try to turn a negative know my point is if you're pure nothing can corrupt you
 how many people might pprno could by Nature than most of the beans out there. Just not in this world are we living in but the point is you try to rid yourself of the of desires that are let's say I think compatible with a nature to self if the nature of the self by Nature we're loving by nature but compassionate by Nature were generous by Nature were sensitive to other
if you get there nothing can corrupt you if you if you deeply realize that my happiness is not tied to any external things you're free if you can't be correct but if you're not and he's already corrupted by false ideas clothes ideas of what I need to be happy. Because of who I am but I'm just saying in other words if someone can corrupt you it means internal you're already corrupted by false ideas
 I think I'm just going to get headed to Bob settings if they want to move here so many things I saw many things these some lyrics and when I was kind of getting a dispute wealthy was Bob Marley's kind of music in his lyrics they're kind of like on I feel they are kind of stepping stool
stepping stools I didn't mean like a step ladder and I buried a lot from Bob Marley this is this is a song it's a famous lyric but to me what he was seeing then I was hearing things that property was saying it was just like they just relying write up for me you know I'm I'm I'm prejudiced because I was I was there but he had so many nice things to say okay I'm older now I'm 58 years old I can just open Let it go you may have heard this one this is from famous song
emancipate yourself from mental slavery is all about emancipate yourself from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds and they says this in this totally remind me a problem maybe I'm tired of this resonates with have no fear for atomic energy cuz none of them can stop the time
 which to me is a is it perfect kind of like example a project said the exact same thing I've seen interviews because this was written at a time when I was afraid that she was going to drop the bomb on us and right and he's saying actually you know there's there's if you zoom out this force is greater this force is far greater than I sits and nowadays he might be accused of spiritually by passing by saying such a thing but
horses out of our control and we think we think we can control it by complaining or posting something on our thing or griping on it publicly we think we're doing a great effort we really do have corrupted our sophomore making bring our Consciousness solo and so down ruining our own life the few things we have to if you think that we can protect our own mind and around thoughts and we're letting those Go game getting caught up in anxiety fear stressed completely polluting everybody around us are children anyone who looks up to us like oh that's the way mom is going to be today all right I guess we should disturb hangry's Durban from song so much trouble in the world
he's he's he's grumpy having a rough day he's grumpy little hungry
 are you outside your two hours that you're allowed to drink juice tonight 2 hours okay stay with me right now this is Bob Marley's lives here unless my eyes this morning he says Joss son is on the rise once again so we took this the Son of God Is On The Rise every morning again that's kind of a zoom out right he's trying to say there's so many troubles are so many problems in the world but same time there's something bigger there's something Eternal behind that there's something steady there's something in control of far more powerful forces that we can feel grounded by always staying in touch with by waking up and looking at the sudden feeling a connection with that right so bless my eyes this morning's Joss son is on the rise once again
then he brings it down to the Earthly level but the way things are going anything could happen and all this is pure profit right here the way that I felt the connection he says
 they're sailing on their ego trips
 Blast Off on their spaceships
 and these are right
 I'm going to different there Siri says what goes on up is coming on down
 goes around comes around before you did but I didn't hear this is just a quote from I don't stay on for black man side out of Stanford white man's side that's a god side says he says long time you fight the route
is a long time you fight Revolution it when you fight Revolution you use guns you don't really want to talk about Revolution until you have guns right so me you don't want to ever talk about Revolution because me know never want to get guns
 Meemic music music is the biggest gun
 this is Bob Marley is not my name I don't even know my name yet
 next came a temporary identity is not who I am
 write this is something in the most spiritual song writer of all thank you thank you Sonia could click this is another quote about why do you keep coming back today I've never experimented with don't need to get you come to these realizations without it but I'm just saying you you don't now hear this
this is something that you've talked about on the show he's just saying it a different way
 this is the biggest coward of a man
 is to awaken the love of a woman without the intention of loving her women what are you I'm looking at a bunch of women hair what do you think about that man they're horrible. Now it's men except Bob Marley are bad for dinner really aren't that many men are broken okay life and jaw nightlife in God are one in the same job is the gift of existence I am in some way you turn
I will never be duplicated The Singularity of every man and woman is Jaws gift
 individual I got no that's okay I was just famous what was this wake up in life is one big road with lots of sand I don't know this was this was a
 is this way, liver is this
 yeah wake up in this house at all. So when you're riding through the rut don't complicate your mind we from hate mischief and jealousy bear your thoughts put your vision to reality wake up and live
 so I'm just trying to say we're going to open yourself up to
in all honesty was it was at that stage in my life by the way you know when when all the guys that I hung out with all the guys that you know of he was our number one guy like we weren't listen to hardcore punk rock nearly as much if this is the number one guy that were listen to is Bob Marley constantly and these were really kind of getting me thinking in a in a spiritual and when I read probably book says this is like the kind of stuff and it last thing you'd like to share on some Bob Marley I think I'm going to have nothing I'm going to be on Spotify listen to some Bob Marley songs little Pieology this plan just a little apology Bob and I was wrong he was a very good it was very nice
I could go on and on actually there's a lot of beautiful since he died of cancer Piercy but he died from cancer
 did Ross's don't like to have surgery
 interesting thank you Bob Marley Rasta and maybe none of you guys would have been here yesterday I was like thank God I can get it to drugs cuz you would have really gotten busy okay let's get excessive vomiting
 get obsessed with things that lift you up not take you down
is referring to a bar graph
 that's kind of I think that's a bit of a stretch but they're sure the connections and I mean run from our perspective if you look at Rastafarians it seems to be a clear connection between them and shy but send me that that the the larger habits that looks or style the whole things are similar let's go to Mom David sulphate India song titled when should I expect the base and sees the Supreme Lord Mariah and reach you this year most human being to the goddess of learning
the author operation about 3 so you need to save your Energy Services a devoted all that is troublesome to the heart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord it was praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable oh my God. The pictures are opening my eyes with a torch set of knowledge I offer obeisance he's there Lotus 7 to text chapter 1 text
 32 sugar day goes so I'm just going to speak here.
the most powerful spiritual master who do who do everything was very pleased that she replied in the presence of everyone taking part but yeah okay so the ritual was going on you just you're just witnessed shusher pause head sliced off instantly by Lord vishnu's sudarshan chakra other the disc weapon have Jerry he was ranting and ranting on and demonic weighs 100 insults are there a large part of the reason why Krishna descended was to rid the Earth of the burden of such horrible rulers and so Christian waited for the right time but then he witness this very unusual happening what was it
 that the sole of shoe Paul is sort of like electrical you could see
who is visible to the eye went out of the body when it died and it disgusts sucked right into Christian speed how fast was as probably really fast or slow motion slow that would be weird if it was slow like it's just going to collect, I think it was fast but that's my guess is
 I don't know if we don't know we don't know if he wasn't so you just you're right at that moment right in that assembly he just started taking the Council of Nar dinardo could you answer this question what we what did we just see that this was a downright downright dirty demon American Google what was she supposed crimes Krishna list and listed a bunch of crimes that he did I'm curious in the crimes that made him so evil can you throw all the King's Inn
please collect the Kings keep them alive in a dungeon and then offer them to, he was really horrible horrible team
 okay so it's Oneida case do you do this you're saying something evil to the core and it's all this behavior and everything I had to say and then he got killed and then we saw his soul you think would be like going down to the darker as tarshish you think I'll be going down to the dark regions you think it was like this and it went into the body of Krishna is point being that
 do you always struggle yourself yoga struggle for that it seems like God is playing favorites with the demigods but here saying no no this evil King was criticizing Christian himself
so why going on here how can you be like so demonic and then get get the the result that like a great Yogi she's right X 23 the Great Sage Naruto at G said okay blasphemy and praise chastisement and respect our experience because of ignorance and the body of the condition soul is planned by the Lord for suffering in the material world to the agency of the external energy was extremely energy mean okay buddy of the conditions on 23 right
 during the first again correcting me are you reading the verse again you were part of it again
my appointment I was just I wanted to get into this verse I thought you would have done thank you excellent then read the commentary
 have you read that yet
 some people just hit my hard day and I'm here for you run, or even Bob Marley songs everything's okay everything's all right
 Supreme Lord is situated in the verse 1st Peter Ruth hiring in my area
 streamlord situated never was heart of Arjuna and is directing the wanderings of all living entities who are seated as on a machine made of
nature energy great great line isn't it we're seated on a machine made of matter if somebody hits your body is manufactured by the external energy according to the direction of the Supreme person I've got head they condition Soul being Seated on this machine wander throughout the Universe and because of his bodily conception of life he only suffers well that. That seems like a negative Nelly
 first of all the way that uses only there I wonder if he's using it like an Indian person or like an English person or like another words
 Indian songs use the word only in an unusual way. They they they dropped only at the end of the of the so they build the other sale I come all I've been here for one hour only or something like that I will say I've only been I've only been there for an hour how much is it $5 only
so it's so here is a question is he saying that all we do is suffer or they're saying that only because of the bottle of conception do we suffer I think that's what it's saying right the condition so being silly on this machine wander throughout the Universe and because of his Bali conception of Life only he suffers like that that you could git absolute sense of the word yes yeah yeah it's it it's designed to give pain you just like yours a finger here's a hand how much pleasure can I give this hand I can rub it with a feather I can kiss it I can put some hand cream on it you know how much pleasure can I actually give a hint that you might let me ask you another question how much pain can I give this ham a lot I can fight it I could show it I can run it over with a truck I can hit it with the hammer and some kind of
grinder door drill heard it I can put a check what about you I got fingernails don't know what time is running short the window pleasure is closing my mother is putting a few people is 97 years and years old and says I have no eggs and pains would have you. I got extra she wasn't jumping on stage is another way to say it is just like we talked about prisoners in prison right we think of it as there's nothing but suffering going on there you know they're trying to squeeze out some enjoyment of the name I think I'll today was a good day for us and has nothing but suffering
forgive me if you're imprisoned we love you okay let's get some when I come to you actually the suffering actually actually the suffering of being blasphemed
 Indiana showing me cuz this was exhausting suffering of being blasphemed and the enjoyment of being praised the acceptance of good welcome or chastise or by harsh words are fell in the material world in the natural conception of life which is the body this brain personality got hit is not material but such hidden under a bigger
 is unaffected by the insults or the greetings blasphemy or prayers so so everything that she should probably
Sonic Krishna it didn't touch him at all he didn't even kill him because of that you know she killed him because he was horrible demon that was like a burden to the Earth anyway because he wanted to liberate him because he was ultimately is devoting the long run going back many lifetimes right so it's not that Christian was responding to me like that you can't insult anyone that's not on the Bali conception this is like a virgin start seeing all kind of insulting things about your body if you're if you're not identify with the body just doesn't matter if I said pull up in a car that I borrowed from someone in the car is like a real wreck and someone just start sitting so the car man that is a stupid ass looking car I've ever seen the guards are going on and they think they're affecting me it's not even my car go ahead say whatever you want to see you and I was like I don't identify with it's not even mine and so silly when someone's off that ball the concept they're really not prone to whether its prey
or whether it's a blast stream blasphemy they're beyond it then they can have that some of them that even mind their knowledge their knowledge frees them from the burden of being prone or because honorable to feeling pain to those kind of insults please continue
 to teach you to do
 and disappeared being always unaffected
 who was here but since the body may be right that he's an affected by the insults and the greetings yeah being always unaffected and complete he does not feel pleasure when offered nice Prayer by the devotee
 all of the devotee benefits by offering prayers to the Lord indeed the Lord is very kind to his
so-called enemy because one who always thinks of the personality of godhead as an enemy also benefits so again that's where we were starting yesterday right was that Krishna himself he is this
 beautiful manifestation of the internal energy the original manifestation of the of the internal energy and just simply the act of thinking of him remembering him connects us with that energy and purify us so even if you're thinking of him
 with hatred you're still connecting to that energy and that's what happened was your fault that he caused Not only was he thinking he was absorbed in and he was deeply absorbed in that energy right and so through that
 you get them if you get the the blessing just by that meditation
 is it condition Soul thinking of the Lord
is an enemy or a friend somehow or other becomes attached to the Lord he receives great benefit appropriate answer the question before noticing that the spaghetti Bernardo goes on to say
 did you have someone information in there
 next text 2025 being in the bottle of conception of Life considered is considered his body to be a cell and considers everything relationship with a body to be his get off my phone cut off my chair in my refrigerator close refrigerator because he has this wrong conception of life he has subjected to the DeWalt he's like praise and chastisement
then I said oh, tearing only when one is only when a condition so accept the body as I'm self does he feel the effects of chastisement and praise
 this is the answer for the oldest bodily positivity stuff you know like yes we should try to be healthy as far as possible but but we all could suffer due to the conception of our body just if her mind is there sometimes people are like totally trashed and I think I'm too skinny or I'm too fat to skinny yeah it's it's just like it's really just about elevating your your identification beyond the body that's the ultimate answer to it all my little fat to do yoga
 I told you that and I
not my usual and he came and he came to the temple and with this old man this Yogi and he said what because of you I started taking up yoga and I was like I'll call you at least you got so fat and I was like I'm fat is not
 that's how you and he said it looked at Migos can you still do yoga as bad as you are and I Could Teach the old man yoga teacher interrupted goes yes even as bad as he is still do y'all got back here I was like I'm going to go back to bed
all right all right
 read the whole thing come on come on baba ganoush
 read the whole only when a condition so accepts the body as himself does he feel the effects of chastisement or praise then he determines one person to be his enemy
 and another his friend and wants to chastise the enemy and welcome my friend this creation of friends and enemy is result of one's bodily conception of our we have the world broadly speaking as result of a bottle of conception I can think of a thousand issues I have that are just due to my bottle the conception of life
 let's go 1
I got the body don't sweat it I'm getting hair on the back of my arms and it's driving me insane don't worry I'm not the body style my hair and my hair I shaved head grows out just a little bit it's like obvious that I have male pattern baldness it drives me crazy makes you want to shave it again no problem no problem I'm not the body I've been looking at my nose in the air a lot lately and it looks like there's that wasn't they don't all this rain we're going to 1000 Fishel things like how I feel about myself my identity and things like that or how I do other people other souls and how I judge other people and things like that are playing my I'm 58 years old I'm worried about like in the doctor say
like I'm worried about it why can't die saving yourself some more
 yes out my problems down the world thinks that when the body is the living being is annihilated
 interesting yeah my body's going to be in Iowa there's a logic to it and I'm going to be quite fine about it imagine if it's just like you would have cut off my head and chest
 there's a cop ahead and like nothing happens like I'm just still aware of all of you guys you guys won't see me but I see you is that probably what happens to the Hat
 I know I'm saying suppose I'm dead I killed myself
do the spider you wear to the Head are you we're somewhere beyond do you think you're going to die
 I'll text 25 please it's 25
 because the other person thinks that when the body is annihilated a living being is not highlighted Lord Vishnu the screen portion of the godhead is the Supreme controller the Super Soul of all living entities because he has no with your body has no false conception of I am I in mine
 it is therefore incorrect to think that he feels pleasure or pain when blasphemed or offered prayers this is impossible for him cuz he has no enemy and no friend when he chastises of the Demons it is for their good and when he accepts the prayers of the devotees it is for their good he is effect
neither my prayers nor blasphemy Beyond at all they are for by enmity or by bhakti by fear by affection or by Lusty desire
 buy all of these or any one of them if they conditioned Soul somehow or other concentrates his mind upon the Lord the result is the same for the Lord because of his Blissful position is never affected by Emma t or friendship or Krishna Gupta
 I've a hunch back to job back woman that was attracted to Christian Christian just kind of on hunched back to beautiful
 do that and she regularly had affairs with I run I just read this
reading
 just read that
 outlet stores in the comics or something to verses from the Quran
 what number is 27
 he continued it should tell me what you think this is the question
 okay? Studio audience
 question about why Krishna made the Hunchback woman beautiful if we are more than our bodies
 I said I think it's
it was a body that was for you
 I think she was giving a body that enables her to please Krishna that she felt this is the body I want to offer to Krishna and then she was granted a buddy
 she's beautiful inside and outside
 don't worry we're not the body
 text 1:32 weary 2727
 you're like I don't see it on there where is it is orbs in in thigh
I just reported God had his one can through enmity is an amazing sladek amazing statement through box you can't
 he hated him so much that it was almost the medication was so strong
 I mean I wonder if that service one cannot achieve such intense absorption and thought of the Supreme personality of godhead as one came through hatred and has my opinion that is why do you keep moving the generator that's what I just said
 you going to read it I just did it almost sounds like that statement is
 and I don't know maybe not meant to take be taken completely literally maybe because I think that this is the deepest of all these would have the strongest meditations on Christian when you think maybe it was just a point that hatred a cigar in power
now this text is fascinating
 Shimano Altus to text against 20 and 29 I need a pre name I need to be like like shreemaan rock anak Kos you want to talk to you more like a pretty name
 I guess it is sort of like an honorific name brand tree mom dies
 text Lena, I'll call it you if you want. Please read the next two verses
 a grass worm was the grass warm I don't know but somewhere in the crowd around the grass is to be grass worm confined in a hole of a wall by a bee know imagine your worm and there's a hole in the wall and there's Abby I said that can't fit in that hole so you're like you're in that hole
the bees right there in my God that's a terrifying be
 you're so your mind isn't completely caught up in the P the beat and then the beasts are getting in the whole okay you know come in as soon as the grass worm could find in a hole in the wall by Abby always sticks have the day in fear and enmity and later becomes a p
 simply because of such remembrance
 he does and Leah hook a similarly if the conditions Soul somehow or other thing of Krishna with such an individual Hut they will become free from their sins weather thinking of him as their worship of a lord or an enemy because of constantly thinking of him they will regain their spiritual bodies every one of these guys are like Aunt I called people krishna's I hate those guys they probably are purified by absolutely
seems to be what I'm saying here
 it seemed that the meditation of the worm is just imagine if you're so small
 the baby would be so big like these scare people like big humans that'll be scared of humans what they speak of your little worm be really big and it in your tracks Giant
 owner Stinger shine Stinger yes but that was before your body imagine how terrifying that beat like the close-ups of insects just like how terrifying that look they're hideous I'm at Stinger with pumps for 3
tired being so you're terrified you're absolutely terrifying you're stuck in the hell you got no Escape looking out of this crazy bi-search so now you're focused on that beat in a state of yogurt trance practically but through fear yeah so it's it's saying that if we in any way that are mine goes to Krishna if it goes there with that kind of intensity you to achieve Liberation but you don't even at this verses quoted in terms of meditating cuz it said at the end what is thinking of him as their worship of the Lord or is an enemy because of constantly thinking of him they will regain their spiritual bodies and that's what gets really to the heart of the practice of bhakti is that whether it's through song
 whether it's through drama whether it's through ritual whether it's through service and weather
I'm sorry dance dance any type of cultural art any kind of ritual practices of meditation in any way that you bring your mind to Krishna with an intensity if you could there's so many ways that the mind can be drawn to Krishna and what's the speed of is not your own with fear force not drawn by hatred but if it's drawn by faction by love then threw that the power of that meditation just like that worm becomes a b we regain our spiritual body that's how you were getting your spiritual eyes to the is that kind of focus to yogurt do that yoga focus and but the bhakti meditation is is so much it's so advantageous because it gives you all of those ways all those Outlets to draw the Mind whereas to sit alone and try to meditate on nothing
 would be so difficult
GT worship was so cool totally always having this talk with today Jen bear
 I came into the training like we're so I can you guys are going to Harry Krishna you like ice cream but she does she makes jewelry and she makes like I think like tiaras and some frozen stuff like that wedding I'm dressing this Daniel cuz I can sound very very far into people like I'm going to dress up as a statue but when you actually this is the form of Lord is such a powerful meditational practice it's like
 I think it's maybe an eighth and all beings to
dress up a dollar take care of things or she got to like put your mind into the mind of the object that you're worshipping me put this blanket around you or give a child with ADD symptoms I start to think o Krishna it's cold today maybe you should wear a charter what type of flutes do you want to play today Christian look at all the different flutes we have if you want to come see you right and then we think yeah what kind of special Crown yeah you want the big one look at all the peacock feathers feathers the single feather one today and if you're putting yourself in like Krishna is your friend your love your child and in taking care of that for me I don't know how it works incredibly impeccably designed by somebody
 you fall in love with Krishna is designed to make you fall in love with Krishna by the simple thing
Renaissance festivals that I was trying to tell her today I was like yeah David has a sunken Courtyard marble something Courtyard so they filled it with water and take Krishna Krishna I feel it the whole thing with flowers floating in the water make designs with the snow is it going it's like a designed to make you fall in love and it works
 right it does it makes you fall in love with Christian and I think so through that kind of meditation when we do things their spiritual body their their Eternal Body
 I think else you want to share
it's who could think this is a genius genius thing we got going here it's great stuff
 tell laid out so I laid out today you and you guys cuz run as long as you in class after this what if you if you're to dress up but I'm your t locker do it. So you look good dude so that you'll look good for Krishna, getting dressed now you're saying I'm not on your case let's meet you
