I went for the my annual checkup on my birthday and then they said your heart is big on one side and I said yes my heart is Big isn't that the one
is an impacted it is very good here it is very bad so I had to get an MRI today which is very interesting so I add even shared a big circle in my chest like like like Hanuman like in Mumbai was losing their mind last night and I'm going to bed at 10:30 10:45 cuz I had to get hooked up with all these wires by the study of the hospital at 1st and fireworks for miles 4 kilometers I'm pulling into the city but then it was just like parties we were right by the Mirror Mirror Mirror out of control all night long and there's ROM Flags
 on every Street Post in Mumbai right now
cut out posters of ROM it's like full-on it like it's over it's quite overwhelming and see Wally the original the original I'm coming home I'm coming home that's okay it was good it was
 you don't think about being in that hospital bed in the morning and I can do I know anybody and I was like you know what it must be really sad for people who are dying in the hospital loan or people and their family and other parents going to their you know
 Pilates like it's just like a lonely way too. I was thinking like this but you know what I did
talk to her about that do they lead anywhere but one was I was in the to do that once with electrodes all over you and I'm just going to be like I'm just going to close my eyes and think of Krishna I was just like thinking of different pictures of these weird noises I hear Tom people say a ton in there and I was just thinking you know what
 yeah are you always be prepared close your eyes and think of Christmas and that made me realize I want to really just
how to take pictures of Krishna that I love so that when I close my eyes they could be like engraved in my thoughts first picture of baby Krishna bending down looking all this reveals so much inner spiritual identity
 you didn't miss much
 okay when we check on there but we might get hard. By the way we stopped over at we got the best Gujarati lunch we arrived when I tried. What's going on over there in that little cottage I just invited myself over for lunch it was no problem

say hello to the world of wisdom of sages listings at
 say hello say hello to our listeners are thousands of listeners that want to get to know you doing on the mics and sorry to Paris. So while we are eating this incredible lunch today incredible and is every preparation was like I've never had anything like this I've never had anything like this I've never had like that so while we're doing that we started asking about your father and your grandfather and your father recently passed where you been I mentioned you on the show like three times already that we have this magical meeting this year on the ganga when your boat was Sailing by our boat I said that looks like our village in Varanasi and I was like that is Hari Priya and she was asked and then she reminded me like a few days
she said my father has been very sick please pray for him I said what what's his name I pray for him
 and we have this magical meeting in Varanasi yeah it was very special just for a week or ten days back when I just called me and he said for some work related to Golden Eagle Village and then he said how's everything with you and I said my father is very sick and he said please tell me his name and I will pray for him and then we had a long talk discussing many things and you know who it was so genuine again at the end of the dock he said can you please remind me of your father's name because he was he's so sincerely wanted to pray for him and I was really touched and then I told him his name is a cute and he said oh it's you that I will pray for him and a few days a week later my father left this world and miraculously somehow by Krishna derangement radhanath Swami came all the way from Kolkata for another
one of his very dear disciple security mataji and then he also came to meet my father and not conscious and nobody was allowed to meet him and my dad was there only for two days and my dad was saying I've come only with an intention to meet him and it was so sad all the time. You can't meet them because nobody's allowed but the day he was going to leave somehow you know we got permission and my dad could come there and he could meet him and the CEO of that hospital had lost his son in a similar way and he was a very compassionate and he said I know what this means and okay it's a little dangerous for the patient but still we let your Swami go in just for one minute and then you know he can meet him but he has to come back only one person at a time so indecisive
there was this classroom where my father was and they let me return to wear like everything a mask and a cap and and then when he went inside it was one minute 2 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes and my dad wouldn't come out and and the see you wouldn't say anything the nurse wouldn't say anything and the doctors weren't saying anything and Marge was standing still not moving and we could just see my reg and my father just found this little window on the door which was just a glass thing so at but my husband because we are so much easier and sometimes you know there's so many guests who takes so much time and we are so protective of mad at my husband was like no no no we can't have my garage in so much time he has to come out so he was strapped to the door we were trying to tell the nurse that please send Mirage outside because please tell swamiji's timer
and he should come out and the nurse wouldn't say anything like she was just so and then after what she couldn't do what he called her outside said no he has to leave he has some urgent meeting please tell him to come and then she finally went and she told the Mirage that do you know you are called outside and then again Mirage play prayed for 23 minutes and he came out and he told my mother that he's in safe hands he's just suffering here I mean you feel his suffering on the physical level but he's already taken off and then I was telling Mirage Mara you are so sick and you waited so long and my dad said I could just feel the presence of Radha and Krishna and but they told me to leave and you know I wanted to pray more and so I can we were thinking because we were so hopeful that because my dad met my father he would live so we were like why is my dad's telling us
because we were still feeling or he should live a number I just come so he will live and I think it was like my father was just waiting for my dad because my dad met him on the 12th and on the 14th my father left your father was number one from IIT little background and in India like like that he had five sisters so to have five sisters and take care of their marriage and you know everything it was and my grandfather would tell him know you studied enough like you should start working because we have to support the family but he was super intelligent so he was telling his elder sister was working that time please help me fill this form of I-80 and you know I want to go and they secretly fill the form and he got through and then he stole his father give me 5 years I take care of our family responsibilities and
yeah he successfully became like an engineer for my it. Guy in the closet and they had this whole trip where 70% of the poverty of India is on the bank of the Ganges so they wanted to educate the women and you know so they were telling about Safe Motherhood and the children having polio disease so it was a trip which was for around four and a half months they walk two thousand four hundred kilometers from gumlog to gangasagar to the Bay of Bengal
 along the banks of the ganga the main team was around like 50 people and my mother who was like the medium because of which my father when they're she said after 15 days after give because they leave because the kids are there and I have work and he was like
I'm staying back and he did the whole five and a half months and he 24 km he walked from work to ganga Sagar so actually when we did his Ashes In Motion at the Kashi Banaras we were on this boat we were in Marsing the ashes and the the pujari that was doing the ceremony he said now ganga Maiya has taken your father from one one side of the shore to the other side and then my brother said yay my father has walked you know from Gomer to ganga Sagar and he was like blown away he said yeah he's the priest was he said he said or ten years back she's already taken them you know we are just doing something with you. Just doing sandwiches and we just finished the emotion and we were like you know like it was made appointment for all of us and on another boat with C Raghu not with like 50 westerners call coming and I was like that.
and with the same Hood does it start their the grandfather was actually a saint yes my grandfather light from dining with you like from childhood like when you know he got some sense he was doing a car that she and as he grew up little bit he was doing chaturmas like you know four months he wouldn't have even saw it like he would be just once a day and then when he grew older than he was a gandhian so you would just wear like cut the cotton candy and just white Cadillac just a clot and they have this gandhian hat white color and like a cotton kurta and Dorothy that's it like yeah like everyday morning like as a child I know I grew up he would indita press go to put away all these small books which has bhagwat Geeta in which muscles do not like
the name of the bishop so like 4 in the morning he would get up and because to not to save electricity and also not disturb other people were sleeping in the passageway light in the hallway lights and the he would read the whole book budget and businesses not every day that he would be very clean blood lines aren't they and that's why you got to hide. Who's never committed to sit in their life is good fun. Thank you. We come from such damaged broken if not criminal Bloodlines and that's why we're so darn broken here we're trying to piece we're like Humpty Dumpty back together
 you guys got a great radio voice
Little Krishna cartoon animation you sound like you're from the little well your stories fabulous I could pick your brain for hours and I will if you might be back for lunch okay then we'll come back something I said to look at come home and he said did I just invite myself I said it's okay
 thank you so much we want to raise the bar bar spiritual life thank you for
 the teenage girl telling your grandfather is proud of you. I pray I don't know if we really mentioned it but how
I wasn't really just kind of run the whole place are we doing today or we we got Nuggets. This time I know I sent it but you want me to lie really for mine that you know it's wrong
 it's from the panchatantra that is like the Aesop's Fables of Fortune belongs to him who has a contented mind said to tell you yes isn't the whole earth covered with leather or one whose feet are encased in shoes in other words if you have shoes on it doesn't matter where you go you like I say you had no shoes then there's so many rocks there's so many like the one I say it would be impossible to cover the whole thing in leather
so that you could walk it in okay. You have to be to put a shoes it doesn't matter where you go I get anyone who has a contented mind whatever the material world pictures and they don't need to change everything in the world know cuz they have a contented mind no matter what they encounter in the world they could be happy in any circumstance you know we're living in a like a bubble of peace in our lifetime most part I'll come on you think know we are so fortunate in this lifetime like this little American European culture that's never had like in our lifetime of War we had lots of words in on our lands on our lands I mean there's there's it's never been a time where they say and it would get the kids run gather a few things run for your life and that is like a real thing going on all over the world we've lived in a bubble of Harmony it would bubble up with economies reasonably pretty good of a bubble where you could come with nothing and Bill your way to the top that doesn't happen and that Bubba
puncture as it's been punctured in all arriving cultures throughout the world with the last
 thousands of years you know kingdoms rise and kingdoms come to have the Good Fortune bubble that's coming up or you going to the place where I was going what we're talking about contentment so it's our opportunity and it's almost our duty for this our self and the ones we love to develop a Content mind
 if not for ourselves for the ones we love cuz the degree that Mom's Disturbed or dads Disturbed how can the kids live in peace the kids become a caretaker for the parents that's never good that's always backwards so yeah essentially this is it's about Sentosa right this is one of the the nehemiah's in
and the stronger yoga right but it's something that is there for all the yoga systems at the mines not content then it is forced to go external right if you're not content with the externals and your mind is forced to be focused on the externals to try to change them in some way and that is a daunting and it keeps us in a constant state of dissatisfaction but I noticed that this this a punt return Truth by the way I wish I knew what story was from panchatantra
 no she's going to go steal a few stories you know it may be crocodile in the monkey or something like that
 yeah but it's okay but in any case this is this is actually coming from bhagva Thomasina Country Fried Chicken from
because in the 15 chapter the seven Canto is very similar things said already this is text us 16 and 17 from the 15 chapter 27 cancellation of the time it says they're one who is content and satisfied
 animal Lynx their activities with the Supreme residing within the heart of every living being enjoy transcendental happiness without endeavoring for their livelihood
 where is such happiness for materialistic man whose impelled by lust and greed and who therefore wanders in all directions with the desire to accumulate wealth so give me a whole different attitude about life it's saying we can work hard to try to make money to buy things I'll make us happy but other people can actually just going to call to make contentment and their needs become so much more simple and right while I just call to make contentment
let me just finish this one then you can so then the next text $0.17 per person less suitable shoes on their feet there's no danger even when they walk on Pebbles and Torrence
 pray for them everything is auspicious simile for one who is always So Satisfied there is no distress indeed they feel happiness everywhere sure manufacturer Happiness by some particular Adventure
 my friend I was like he just got back from Iceland there's a house Iceland he goes to school
 actually the whole trip was horrible because our car went out in the middle of somewhere towards this hotel we got way way or what our car broke down in the middle of the road no one picked us up a fabricator
to plan our happiness sometimes a huge costs
 he's top of the dentures that makes it even more devastating when it doesn't work because I just read about when I say red watched on Instagram for me to read
 that's cute as I can and I'm going to still get it all wrong but she was she's going to freedive what is the name for that
 clutch on base jumping she's going to base jump from the Grand Canyon Place of the Grand Canyon is like the first time ever no one's ever done it and she's building up to this she's practice you doing small or jumps it was so many things got great ideas for her team she's got a team with her they're all excited about it
 she never opens
 John
on television to her death on television in America like in the 70s
 it's a big plan for happiness the material world
 when I just be content to take it apart for your grandfather grandfather that man I just had my bug of agita sahastranaam what time of the day was that
 support in the morning just gets up he must have spent 24 hours
 yeah
 2 hours he's done two hours of sitting there
 but that's that's what I need to be content right he's going fast
we could you know these are the wise people these are the people that are dead aren't walking around Barefoot you know trying to change everywhere they walk to her put on a pair of shoes let me listen learn to be content then under any circumstances I'm good you know it was like that with all the upheavals that went down in 2020
 it's going to be cool it's really quiet over there one day what do you know about the test miserable you pass the oldest yoga sutras it actually says for all the yamas and niyamas is there's a there's a special blessing if you master it
and so far I mean a supply scene for Santos it's by contentment the highest happiness isn't what's the blessing for what
 as my favorite is non-violence not by that
 the special blessing you get if you master non-violence is that
 go ahead and I seen this I've seen people that have mastered ahimsa and I've seen actually how this works Master eyewitnesses to the core of your being you let go of any desire to harm another living do you know what I don't have that because I told you a story once we're we're we're selling
my daughter my daughter stepped on my daughter goes and then she's going to process traveling that one gets that when you've mastered totally imbibes non-violence and so is that violence does not happen in your surrounding area like another's you affect everyone else in your aura they become peaceful
 just try. I'll try to explain how I understand
one way that this works okay
 you know you didn't stop me Jesus apparently Jesus came for that to happen so that he could teach nonviolence it without that happening he wouldn't have the platform and wish to demonstrate on such a level but it didn't teach an even and even it and even they may have walked away from that like changed so I remember once
 it was delicious I was trying to commit commit violence towards me it was you but you were peaceful I was relatively peaceful but I'm not the person that was demonstrating the the the non-violence it was sprung this one you're with Ron us while we someone tried to get violent with you in a way like they were trying to do me harm them physically do you harm them physically
 but they were trying to harm me
speak ill to you know kind of like a q down so let me know what kind of like I don't know why you could have just been content with as much as I told you things I want I don't want to I Don't Want to Lose the person in the room now maybe but but they were trying to like kind of like a kind of like what do you call it when you kind of like
 why you doing that everybody everybody that something's happening here ok Google community in Seattle
real like for real they were really trying to get you out yeah sorry it's all right let me continue SSI so there it was really is really long but then what happened was that that person like me you know we're both taking our instruction from ramaswamy and that person realize that when he comes when he arrives here which was shortly thereafter okay he's going to have to explain
 why you behave the way he did you know you know where is Chris tuba was not it right why not and such so and then he he realized I have to I have to change I have to apologize and then I realized it was only because of his influence right without his influence it would have stuck right but he said in his hair
I can't I can't behave that way and I just saw how how a person that's in by the nonviolent attitude how it spreads from them did you some knowledge it has acknowledged it first then thank you for all I know you're totally different direction I'm at the boat with you okay I just got the night just the other night yeah that's great with the Maharaj we can run today I felt like the entire place
 felt like he's talking about me that's it right everybody's feeling because
he was saying you cannot hold these resentment you got to take full responsibility buddy felt a part of my heart has to open up wide or not even wider if I'm going to make this Krishna Consciousness stuff actually worked exactly yeah so that to me is is an example of what do yoga sutras are saying with so much helium by a kiss spreads there's a benediction for each niama, you got more okay we can come back when you come back so I finally that's what you get for that will do a little research ready
we got some to tell Jana madere before he said that she went back with Tom witches are very means of Conquest when should I bring back to the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan Ricci the Super Bowl being entombed of the sheriff's Waukee the goddess of learning and they should have the audacity of the author about the issue and it's in back of my regular tenants in class in the bottom of time and memory service to the pier to Bodhi is all that is troublesome to the heart will become erratic ated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transit the songs will be established as in a revocable you know whatever is troublesome to your heart right now with that MRI could be relieved by hearing Bob the time
 I looked at it like that but yes
list of ignorance and my teachers are opening my eyes on the torch light of knowledge I offer my obeisance he's at their Lotus feet
 read from The Bob & Tom Canto 7 chapter to text know where to start a new chapter text number one Never What's the title of the chapter is called King of the demon okay so there's a connection here that we were just reading my ship pole and dumped about could then we heard about how John vgi the the the guard The Gatekeepers to buy country workers to come down and take three different first and one of them was a surrender, Shippuden and run yakshe really liking chapter like part one here's your first births you know
 but I don't know if the exactly is going to go through all three but in any case that brought up a brought up to you the question of
yudhister ask why did he run your car she poo this
 this superpower demon who is like so influential why did he have such animosity towards him is sucking blood what was that all about and so now we get a sound like six or seven chapters kids can get you angry or going to start in the house and now we're going to see how this is all going to start about who her run your cashew Pooh is he's going to he's going to kind of represent the demoniac mentality this person is my friend that person is my enemy right there is no one to answer to an end we're going to hear about his determination to wipe out Lord Vishnu in to wipe out the brahmins and white Under Armour xcetera
 is the real archetype of Evil Hear no power. We're going to have so much to learn from this little boy
shinar to set sonar does
 narrating here to you to steer you to steer my dear King you to steer when Lord Vishnu in the form of a Raha the boar killed hiranyaksha around you around your ex's brother around your cashew Pooh was extremely angry and begin to live again
 it's just a little choppy so it's okay my dear ku's here when Lord Vishnu in the form of a boar killed her and yaksha around your ex's brother hiranyakashipu was extremely angry and began to limits okay

 exhibiting his terrible teeth

 terrible to see
 he took up his weapon a trident and dust began speaking to his associates the assembled demons get more data Teriyaki some Bara set the bar who agree about an emoji Parker and Ill Villa City Paloma shocking shakuna and other demons and then act according to my words hatching a plot dramatic reading by Rakim.
 Are you okay with the dramatic reading and sleepy Kali Yuga my insignificant enemies the demigods
still might very dear brother and obedient well-wisher my brother around yakshe although the Supreme Lord Vishnu is always equal to both of us namely the demigods and the demons this time be devoutly worship by the demigods is taking their side and help them kill
 Supreme personality godhead has given up his natural tendency of a quality or the demons and the demigod come back to the last chapters although he is the Supreme person now influenced by Maya he has assumed the form of a bore to please his devotees the demigods just as a Restless child leans towards someone I shall therefore seven Lord vishnu's with my Trident I so please my brother
who is so fond of sucking blood the site should be peaceful x 3 x 9 thank you
 when the roots of a tree is cut tree falls down its branches and twigs automatically dry up similarly when I have killed this diplomatic Vishnu the demigods for whom Lord Vishnu is the life and soul will lose the source of their life and will wither away
 why am engaged in the business of killing Lord Vishnu go down to the planet Earth with it which is flourishing YouTuber medical culture and chhetri a government these people engage in austerity sacrificed Vedic study regular vows and
already destroy all the people that's engaged what kind of sick mind sick sick oh we don't have to hear about your YouTube vinge's x 11
 I don't even get those thoughts in the daytime it's is it for some reason I stay up late those are the thoughts in my mind crazy YouTube cuz there is a rock Josh's are out at night in the right again right in your head that's what your grandfather would say 8:30 8:30 is good time did you get up
 but no he was Che
my 44
 good program
 nighttime nighttime
 depends 1010 like my mom says no good can come after 10 she was right right
 text 11 text 11 the basic I'm still hurting a basic principle of Roman culture is to satisfy Lord Vishnu the personification of sacrificial and ritualistic ceremonies Lord Vishnu is that all religious principles and he is the shelter of all the demigods the great Peters and the people in general features of the forefathers killed but no one will exist to encourage the formula and that's the demigods
 being
please by yagya will automatically die so you know this is reminding me of the new mob are two that we're reading right. Just the kind of understood the universal laws in the principal's the idea you know again this whole idea of yagna or sacrifice or these kind of rituals the rituals that is the kind of they
 they kind of bring out they kind of encourage or culture a type of gratitude well it's the heads of the heads of society or performing rituals of appreciation and that is like the lubricant of the wheel of a well-oiled machine
Universal machine and that that is kind of change in the hearts of people bring them to appreciate the gifts of nature realize that behind Nate that whatever I have in life is being provided for me that that begins to change how you think like oh I owe something back oh I mean provide oh I'm not the center of this universe is working for my benefit. I've been ignoring governors of the human species are giving a setting the example and wherever I'm at I'm going to raise my bar a little bit lower grades of humans are trying to raise their bar up and so it's it's going right at the heart is countering the idea like I'm independent I don't owe anyone anything and that's the Demonic attitude and it's that attitude that just bring so much
conflict so much you know paying so much for you know so it's just so much trouble into the week cuz I work for him like I am okay so it's so he's saying we got to wipe out the the the people doing this to people that are supporting at your the whole idea was the government to support it right like the leader should see that these kind of this kind of mentality is is free to grow it out cut cut that cut that all out and they at their idea was like this new needs this right that that's it's not that he doesn't need it but they wanted to kind of snuff it out
 text Ralph
 immediately he's giving them orders now all the other demons immediately to go wherever there is good protection for the cows and the brahmins and wherever The Vedas are studied in terms of an ashram principles
set fire to those places and cut from The Roots the trees there where which of the source of Life found in the trees like what do you like that I like that you know but ReDiscover this really interesting commentary tube rest
 the picture does brought by the picture of the proper human civilization is indirectly described here in a perfect human civilization there must be a class of men only trained as perfect Brahmin okay they need to be people giving good spiritual insights right there living simple that have their very good energy that are give me the high or messages so the people can to bring out the good in people and people trust trustworthy than they don't have an agenda when they're dealing with you I'd already candidate Sardis
yeah okay simile similarly there must be treachery as Warriors to rule the country very nicely according to the injunctions of shots with have to be trained in ethics as well just go to a bunch of people guns and there must, sounds like you're speaking to the Second Amendment there and I think you're kind of like we can't just go around giving guns to anyone
 they should be trained only trained people people are training at 6 to have them exactly exactly
 and the skill to use the Second Amendment so the government doesn't get to Country brightness level.
check the cows check the cows we need some more advice if that's what we need, I was taking Mara to the word the word indicates that house should we give them protection because the wedding civilization is a lost cause you're not protected but instead indiscriminately killed in the slaughterhouses such such acts are the acts of demons you know I was just thinking the cows the cows are so beautiful beautiful imagine don't be careful though they can just turn their has a strong the strong the but but but imagine if in the United States
 they started slaughtering dogs on the level that they slaughter cows imagine if they just opened up about no not an Indian butter
globally what animal is a Eaton it's like dogs
 now it's shocking but but if if if that were done in the United States people just start freaking out and we can see that simple math what to speak of in we spoke we we don't have to go to a big long thing right now but the value that the cow brains to society and providing our food both in terms of milk products which are very healthy when the Cavs have cared for properly with loved one to speak with the power that the oxen bring and how they plow the land to give us the the grains that we each give us the done for the fertilization down for fertilization Organic pesticides also the oils that we could lighter homes like castor oil cotton for a closed all that's by the power of the bull
so these these beautiful loving just like having big beautiful dogs that just do a lot for society do everything for society practice everything you need the power to move things that's this is part of the reason why I didn't either love the cow so much and an interest in a healthy Society can be built around the love and cooperation between humans and cows that the demon say no just kill them all before the hydraulics in the tractors it's like everybody had work horses and animals are auxins you could you couldn't Stonewall build a house without these big animals became part of your family
 we're donkeys RX continued
 door Guardian is a demonic civilization
Devon Armstrong Dharma mentioned here is essential for human civilization shaking out your mind what do you do here unless there is a brominated guide acharya to rule perfectly and a perfect by Shania to produce food and protect the cows how will people live peacefully
 it is impossible for the video is turned off
 we got issues today cuz we got it over here
 letters on it Mary your good are you
another another another four. Probably going to go from the animals to the trees another point is that the trees also should be given protection during its lifetime a tree should not be cut or Industrial Enterprises
 I'll tell you the trees are in this criminally and unnaturally cut for industry
 in particular for paper mills that manufacture of profuse quantity of paper it's really true so much garbage does Amazon sell junk that's what it is a bank is going to send you a letter like twice a month forever to try to get you to take a credit card that you never going to take so yeah don't they get the message they're going to get the message and you know why cuz it is Americans are like ready to consume just got to keep chameleon
or industry in particular paper mills and manufacture profuse quality of paper for the publication of demoniac propaganda nonsensical literature huge quantities of newspaper and many other paper products is a sign of a toilet paper and demoniac this is the sign of demonic civilization The Cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary for the service of Lord Vishnu names of all the horrible magazines at what he does here is a beautiful devotional or Cassidy and what he's about to go work that must be performed otherwise work by planes one in this material world is not great we said it again work done as a sacrifice for bishnu must be performed if you do work but you don't offer to Vishnu as an offer work by
see you in this material world but right but if the paper mill stopped producing paper when they argue how can you publish art disc on literature the answer is that the paper mill should manufacture paper only major clarifies our relationship of Lord Vishnu and therefore the publication of this culture is the performance of a bit bit bit of a beautiful devotional that's a lot of our stuff is just like the fact is it's a free-for-all totally free for like I'm going to take I'm going to cut down tons of trees and buy tons of paper for used to sing cuz I may be able to make some money I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to do the same thing I would do the same thing and before you know it you just destroy the Earth and you need
