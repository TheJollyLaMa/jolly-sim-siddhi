 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages a daily yoga podcast with your house dropping off and co-host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York the stupidest welcome to show everybody Welcome today's study it's Friday study the stream about what time it's good Friday is it I think it is sir it's good Friday today right yeah she gives a thumbs-up she's our resident Harry Krishna Catholic yeah here with a live Zoom crew you know there's about 13,000 people ish that list of the show every
on all the platforms where you can get Podcast then there's people that listen on YouTube but there's about a hundred something everyday on Zoom if you want to join us and zoom you can do that you just e-mail Miss Mara up here wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com and she'll she'll send you the secret mysterious code to get into our little coven of transcendentalist in training you know what you know now we have her in the sixties soon before we're having a closer to a hundred and meet with the with the with the wizard live with live people on Zoom but I think that has a lot to do with we become so erratic in time makes you know I've always been erratic but our show has been erratic and timings yes he's so but it's like
get the calendar right now you speak to that will find out about
 I'm at work Marilee don't where you thought you were that's over you got work to do
 there's a couple different ways it's a little confusing we have a calendar the people can subscribe to and what's great about it is it shows the time in your local time zone okay so that's convenient for people and then also we now have a wisdom of the sages Church info channel on WhatsApp that people can subscribe to where we put updates on the showtimes who made the election issue on the Chargers made the calendar is not going to try on dresses and I think she may be used for a sooner you can put on The Message Board how people subscribe or find that channel we got to tell people we got to put that in the in the show notes you can find the two that way if you like to show up but like sometimes you show up when we're not here
then you just get that and you're good to go because it's numbers back up guess what I'm putting my link up to the for my book on the completely not related I thought that was over but it's number one bestseller in punk music musician biography that's what it says on Amazon what did you peed out for that Henry Rollins I don't know but it changes it randomly changes but it made like $4 so far and I want to thank all the zoom people and and and people who have purchased it awesome you know what
 are you on the same subject can be switching subjects I was the same subjects to double it
alright boys I just going to say I forgot that we just talked about this before that WhatsApp group for calendar and Lucic gaining people are losing people in zoo and I forgot anyway I want to share that I really want to see Harrison which is on April
 15th and 16th in San Francisco
 that's on my website I finally got all my stuff Katie Wyckoff to my website for me she put on it the events up which include a bunch of stuff at the farm go to my events page I'd rather not. Yogi but yeah I'm going to I'm going to do Rich Roll next week I still am really excited for that it's more excited for a really think the masses
 not the masses but there's people within the masses they're really ready for bhakti sometimes
like the Bison of a Cheerios the great sages are giving this like information how to like drink nectar and people are just drinking salt water that's all they want is salty water or donkey urine if you want to know the night again and so I feel like the Rich Roll podcast it's already reach so many people the first time I went in that's where we got people like Linda Linda Linda many people showed up from Rich Roll podcast and they people are there they're ripe for
 meaning they're looking for meaning in life within their heart but they just don't know about it and that's part of our as part of our service and everybody's everybody's service that listens to this is we also evolved by giving this away we also take care of our self by extending our self and taking care of other people that's why we always say share this link
just want to feel the following so mean to us to become like the king and the queen would be the queen but doing this for us we're doing this to Guru and gouranga Orchard Tanya and R and R and the teachers and I feel like it's really important for all of us to take a personal responsibility to give this to other people especially who are in this world and are actually eager to find something so I'm excited for that podcast and
 all I want sex I know that it looking forward to that too
 all right Miss America who shows up on these big podcast little bit more cuz you're too collected in car
you're too much the straight man you make me wild but isn't Rich Roll a straight man
 different straight but he just goes talk allow for the squirrels nice I was wondering who's poo wasn't it sent you that squirrel is that Martinez Martine you should have sent that squirrel to me so that when he's grilling I can hold up the squirrel call Martin estacio okay thank you
 hey what's up man it's been down since we're back to Recovery Group meetings today online at 12:30 and 1 eastern time and in person tonight at the bhakti center and then call Tim Kaine Josh Cain is offering his ass in the class for Patron numbers at 10:30 this morning and the Sunday is urban Davie via the bhakti center
Patrick miniport I am going to see him at the Connecticut show with David house worth and anybody else coming to Connecticut right if you're out here put it on the board like to see his coming anybody coming to any of the shows write it on the board want to see so I can be diverted while cuz Steve is saying something important okay what's get into our today's nugget wheel nugget if you're new to this game something like substantial that someone who's not necessarily A Krishna bhakti person but it says something that has to do with the things that were talking about during the day and channel it shows its trust show a thread a commonality between deep thinkers are out truth is universal so this nugget is from
 Wittgenstein and he's like a van in between the right like that 3 named thing Ludwig no one in the United States has ever named their child
Ludwig is ever have him something it's never happened because it you know why it reminds us of earwigs which are the horrible bugs that come out of the summer that crawl into your ear making saying I don't even know what I said this is what life who is he
 he's an Austrian philosopher who work primarily in Logic the philosophy of mathematics the philosophy of the mind and the philosophy of language she had a broad philosophical repertoire
 I got to feeling like Ludwig and Austria that was like the John or Dave Connecticut
 I don't think it's a lot of work though I don't think they pronounce it if I say it's more like Lucy bead music
 what
 no one can hear you mirror you're not talking until they're not married and she was born in Louisiana
if I am I high school that means once a day can throw it against the locker what was your high school like was your high school okay course I was like that it was brutal okay alright ludvig engineering boots the high school like those Circle Jerks boots you know if it's brutal has to say I don't know why we are here but I'm pretty sure
 that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves that sounds like a person ripe with life experience isn't it you say that
 it does I agree with you I looked up this quote it was a
a listener sent as soon as a suggested nugget and I appreciate that and I looked it up and I found it was kind of like some philosophical chat board was discussing it. What do you think it means bright and he had like a lot of people would come back and forth but like some people are saying like do Sourpuss I don't know why you got to be such a buzzkill like it sound like that you know it's a matter with this guy but then other people I think catching on to the real Spirit of it which was saying that there's something more to life than just seeking Pleasures you know seeking
 external enjoyments that this there's a mission here there's a purpose to all this there's something deeper behind we should search for that we should go for that in and that's the end of that song
 what you don't even like in these suits
the very sutras
 weather, sutras Univision to Sutra or whether it's the yoga sutras I think it's common that these different philosophical schools they they take their teachings and they kind of compress them into the sutras take this broad School of philosophy and you condense it into these maybe two hundred or so of these aphorisms and then you memorize those Africans now you got the whole philosophy laid out for you right then you can begin with like the word or you know like I tell you about a shots in America tato at October me to get gas now is the time to get serious now it is it like now I found them I I actually did a little study on that this morning
 yeah just seeing like how how the different
imitators
 treat that word like what they make of it and you get different explanations like sometimes it's like
 now did it in the most simple way like now would we are about to read is about yoga or now what you're about to read is about getting now we're going to go into this topic
 and another stake out a little bit further and they say that this indicates the now indicates
 like I already know that we now that we've studied all these other subjects now we're kind of graduating to the most important subject so you know but but in an Ender other explanation for 21 prop had spoke of this he calmly spoke of it
 like what I read you something
 I think I got it here he was he would speak of it as like oh here we go
 probably bright
or maybe he said this in a lecture the first statement of it on to Sutra is at Otto Bremer jignasa now having obtained the human birth
 I want you to inquire into Brahman the absolute truth this is way proper comely spoke of it that's the meaning that he derived from it right is that this universe is a rare thing
 you if you look at all the different species of life
 according to these ancient Texas 8400000 of them and in the human form you get that potential to figure the whole thing out cuz I hate to try to understand why do I go through the cycles has ups and downs of happiness in distress of Pleasure and Pain and and and I'm kind of when I really think about it
 I can't escape that I really can work hard on
and I never seem to break the cycle and if we look at Society you know we're diligently working hard to make this world a more pleasurable place we're trying to deal with the problems that exist to send in texts let these kind of texts kind of laid out here no problem, said your support problems write birth death disease old age these are the things that that causes pain the cause esophagus on the good cuz it's ask you what why don't you focus on the problem so that you can actually experienced the good and in the fact is is like a lot of times we sync become so Advanced you know it look at look at what we've got now you know it will look at the mess we made in Madison
 you know but yeah we made advancements in medicine but we still are suffering from all kind of diseases we can find a cure for 1 and then another one arrived
you know and into this day it is very common for us to suffer great due to our own disease are due to the disease and the death that comes from that from people that are very near and dear to us we haven't solved that problem you know later we we we try and tell me different ways to adjust the external to try to create a pleasurable situation what would I take from Ludwig's statement and any and I appreciate that he's the saying I don't know why we're here you know he's he's vulnerable and that's it but he's pretty sure when he looks around me think about it it's not the it's not in order to enjoy yourselves Were Meant to learn something Were Meant to learn and then when I say learn I don't mean even just academically learn but learn in the sense that we become transformed by Red like I learned this lesson in life is it changed me what are we meant to learn what are meant to focus on what are we meant to understand
what is there a way to overcome the problems that we encounter in this world and why did I get here and what's the purpose for that I appreciate it and it looked exciting here
 yeah you know a lot of the
 capacity Yogi's who do. If there's water in the rivers or they they surround themselves with fire in the summer they do extreme things to their body which are not being quote the enjoy our right there it's not to enjoy it's actually it's not really to suffer either it's to detach yourself from a body to find some type of subtle pleasure and there's a subtle pleasure we're looking for a spiritual pleasure were looking for it it's funny because Sammy from you
today who is if he's been around devoted drummer for five years and he knows the devotee talk and stuff like that so whenever he calls me up he's like
 call Prabhu what do you do when you trying to Detroit to send over there and Upstate New York trying to be the enjoy her and like he'll always call me to say trying to be the enjoy our integral part of our philosophy is like we want to be the center and there is only one enjoy her and that's the idea of Krishna so you'll hear these you'll get statements at the material world is miserable and it really sounds - it really sounds like you guys are a pessimist you're seeing the cup half empty but the idea is that the material world is not enjoyable you just have to analyze it and a lot of us
 are Intoxicated by Good Karma were Intoxicated by some good karma if they would eat
great and you just have to analyze the whole world the whole picture you know walking through the into hospitals in to become an EMT or hang out with surgeons and you realize there's a lot of suffering going on right here that's one way to look at it but another way to look at it is actually we're not the enjoyed the material world but our Birthright is enjoyment we are allowed to enjoy the world but our enjoyment comes from like a different path and it comes through seeing ourselves as part of the whole and it is actually our Birthright to be very joyful and Blissful so I like to I like to take that turn on it because
 you can get real it can get real sort of Macabre is that the word likes it so dark and depressing because we're not be enjoy we're not the engineers like I right but your life is already paid. Ramon
but we actually it is our duty to enjoy but it's it's a refined type of enjoyment and if you see people acting like. Abilities and we see that we have people that are left are like great devotees to actually quite and they have so much enjoyment in their heart because their enjoyment comes from serving and loving and giving love it's actually where the best enjoy us we are the biggest word joyous but we haven't but we haven't connected with that potential therefore Were Meant to learn something right this is this is from a lecture that he gave and he was he was some he's describing describing the the life of animals
 is a question answer everywhere life means questions and answers so those who are not interested or do not know what is the aim of Life they've got questions and answers only four cents gravitation they're just trying to
Pleasures right that's all they have no more they have no more any questions or answers whole field of questioning and answering is sense gratification that's all right that's my scope that's how I use my cognitive faculty that's how it that's what I can gauge myself in but the human life is not meant for that purpose the animals they are morning just like birds this early in the morning to begin to chirp where is Food where is it what do we have to go where where do I have to go to find some food that is their business the animal also but youman form of life
 does it mean it is like that that they should be simply involved in questions and answers for sense gratification no there for vedanta Sutra says bra magic NASA at October Madness after this after the evolutionary process of low of lower than human being
we have come we've got this body human form of body the business is bruh magic NASA in any quotes by what time Chivas Chautauqua jignasa that is Bhagavad so that's that's from the
 does the first cancer second chapter life's desire should never be directed towards sense gratification once you desire only healthy life or self-preservation sense of human being is meant for inquiry into the absolute truth nothing else should be the goal of lunch works right let's get focused let's reach our potential you know but this is what this is what I love her papa goes like this he says but there is no education
 there are so many universities there going on simply how to advance the Methodist has craftcation that's all there is no education at October magic NASA the human form of life should be specially engaged for understanding what is Brahman otherwise it is simply spoiled
send you a dude why not engaging in in these kind of increase why would really try to understand who we are you know how might this body is that it is a go look like to satisfy it to maintain it to preserve it to try to find pleasure to it or is there something far more valuable that's just waiting for us
 you know
 Intoxicated by guitar hope you're right back down there was like the most profound thing I said this morning do you know that's one more show to go for a run now perladas speaking to his his schoolmates and he's more like this message right let's not forget the purposes of let's get focused it really nice instructions coming okay here's our prayers and I'm the most security I know that Mom gave him satisfied
before we see the shoe my Baba time which is every means of Conquest one should offer special a base and sees the Supreme Lord to Ryan on 290 trying to reach you this you can go see him being until mother sarswati the goddess of learning and the name of the author non-stop reggae show about race Unity oh I'm back up at Save-A-Lot galatea too much little came back to your regular tennis and classes in the bottom of time and by rendering service a tube out he's all that is troublesome to the heart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh my God he's with a torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet
 reading from the shoe mud bog with Tom Canto 7 chapter 7 text 21
yes that's all that's what he wants I should have said text 21
 okay so he's just getting into that basic a lot of speaking to the to the other kids and he's really coming on that
 let's understand what they're not the body kind of love them this was
 play date play date with the kids at school are like okay I thought we're going to play nope we're going to hear philosophy listen okay
 write an expert geologist he's talking to a bunch of five-year-olds an expert geologist can understand where there is gold in by various processes can extract it from the gold ore
 this kind of stuff essay to write
really fascinating
 I think you just heat it similar
 well now I understand how the spiritual particles exist within the body and dust by cultivating spiritual knowledge you can attain Perfection and spiritual life okay there's a personality right just like there's cold within or right
 so there's another something is there something special with in that larger rock some special more valuable So within the body there's a particle that's a very different quality and that's the self the sold-out you however who is not expert can understand where the gold is a foolish person who has not called the latest knowledge cannot understand how the spirit exists
within the body okay this is what we should be inquiring into the hot tub on the fitness Everett I am Brahman what is Berlin what is spirit was beyond all this okay
 okay the Lord's 8 separated material energies Mara when are they
 berith microphone Mara
 Hotsy
 I don't know and I don't care. You switch the OK Google make up for what you didn't get a chance to get it to you
 kumira Paula novel you, woman her beauty or a pitcher in a property Rasha. How does that get to 44747 5:43 may be right
okay so that's the so this is this is what the song key of philosophy where they break down the world are we living in into a list of ingredients yeah what we are what we are not some really interesting the Lord states that operated material energies the three then also the three modes of material nature and the 16 transformations
 the $0.11 is in the five gross material elements like earth and water within all of these the one Spirit Soul exists as the Observer there for all the Great acharya's have concluded that the individual soul is conditioned by these material elements this was the conversation I was having with my son yesterday on the way to school
 yeah we're talkin about
 the Observer the soul is the Observer
but what did he say
 he just had a bunch of good spiritual questions Nike such as start
 we started talking we just he likes to sharpen his skills on debating about vegetarianism do and how you know and I will I'll give different arguments like I like to eat meat what's the big deal I like it and he's like well you can't just do everything you like for example I might like to do something that's harmful but I can't do it I can't steal even though you see this is what 10 year old should be doing right there or you making it happen here thinking about you is you know it's all related to me so why is it wrong to cuz it because his soul was in there yeah it feels it has it experiences will you know because
how to get the personal stuff but because you know there's different influences of life it influences in his life we eat it and go to a all boys gurukul he's goes to public school different influences in his life have different values you know if you had a container ecb's are the values and you just make it part of their life that's one way to raise a kid but when your kids are just wet out there in the world they have to like
 they have to deeply understand why I'm not doing this that thing that's important to teach their children and you know I will say that's one thing about joiners have you ever heard that that's the word I learned in Alachua you and I are joiners like we jointly Krishna conscious born into a generation devotees you and I are joiners and for the joiners like most people in this podcast you have to really understand this stuff before
because you're attached to your that's how you got there because you were there we really deeply understand it and I don't know you just my mom never made garlic bread so we have to like we we want to understand that that's the benefit of being a jointer being a dented can
 okay man Joyner I know that you
 never liked to talk about this sunken stuff the whole list of this thing or not they love it I love it I bought them so you're basically it's a it's a just a very interesting way of breaking down the elements of the world that were in the equipment that we use to experience it and so on is Alyssa's and then and then it says and then one analyzes and I think that's what the next person get into I'm not any of these since I'm observing them as you say right I'm observing them so
I must not be made of the material elements I must be made of something else I like to use the analogy of a waterfall photo of me trying to catch the water running through my hands of the waterfall is it appears that Frozen still that I have the water but if you if it's in real life or a video you understand that water's always flowing through my hands and my son that our body is like a very slow moving waterfall it's always changing and we're observing we can never catch our body and I said for example I didn't see you in 3 months and I saw you I said you've grown so much but because you came every day you would have noticed you wanted to ask if you didn't notice that you grew but I notice not having seen you so our bodies like that and we're just observing it and then and then this really good and Allergy that I got from that I still use I got 30 years ago from stomach tosses is this my hand is this my five year old hand now
this is a completely different hand completely different hand right down to the molecule nothing here is the same
 so it appears like it's my same hand but it's actually not everything has been replaced and we are just the Observer you trying to catch the waterfall hold the waterfall and end but I say good in a good way to understand is you clip the hair from your your head or your beard and that's gone now and that new hair grows so we're just observing all this matter in flux it is not us but we don't change that to Things You observe her
 doesn't
 the same awareness that was in your 10 year old body is still here because you remember it is the same awareness but now you're in a 58 year old body
can you lose your memory but it's still there that the witness is still there cuz even the memory is temporary but the memory kind of helps prove it right because I do I do for my five-year-old body I like this one I remember my five-year-old subtle body right I remember right seventeen-year-old ego my five-year-old intelligence write my twenty-year-old Minds I remember all those things too and I witnessed them also my body is a shapeshifter my mind is a shapeshifter
 Maris ego is a shapeshifter pick up there anymore in the show no but I see coming up right now and I'm nip it in the bud I'm very very kind of America tell the universe
blink just plain clear okay for everything individually saw a gross body made of five gross elements and they are they we can say we are grossed by the way the material or tangible my yeah you can grip it how about that any subtle body made up of the three subtle elements is what Mara said earlier within these bodies however is the spirit Soul The Observer one must find the Soul by analysis saying this is not it this is not it that's one must separate Spirit from matter that's what I do and I take Nicole plunges super cold by 3 minute cold shower today I just said I'm not the body
 I'm just the Observer I'm not a body I'm just an observer I'm noticing sensation have my body is ready
very very uncomfortable right now I know I don't say that that gives meaning to the sensation I don't say I'm noticing sensation on my body but I'm not saying I'm noticing a good or bad sensation of hot or cold sensation I'm just saying there is a sensational noticed that once I give it meaning that I'm in the body against I'm trying to so this is this is rock and I'll suck your yoga analyzing the matter but not putting myself within it Linda Linda Linda when you do your cold Plunge
 you think I would 5 minutes Cindy Lunsford 5 minutes and not thinking twice now I'm going to put you back on the hot seat so this where it says you're one must find the Soul by now to sing this this is not it this is not it what is the Sanskrit for that
 make it a hint sounds like well
sounds like you Bola in that Opera I love me and that the Nativity not that I think I'm going to take part in it but so so this is a very common aspect of Gianna yoga right now say this Nikki Nikki I'm not I'm not you know I'm not the ingredients that make up this body or or they probably would say do you know like anyone he would explain but you two children and my this hand know because I say it's my hand right am I this leg know cuz it's my leg and my the spot you know it's my body
 you don't even have my this my notes my
find the who is the eye that's observing all that's in a nutshell that's what that Nathan is going to be common knowledge in the same way you can go to a restaurant and say you're vegan options in this is going to be common knowledge for kids I predict you got to make it happen the run we're doing it today playing a hardcore Chef 58 year old man put a hardcore show at night time on 24's got a great commentary on it too
 these and all these guys Jeff Eisenberg David Charles Wilson Timothy Tucker the better not clothesline me either they've been grabbed me by the neck and throw me in
 nonsense please okay there are two kinds of bodies one little bump that sober here did not mean not drunk
silly but like thoughtful not intoxicated not not like drunk on the world right now like Crow this is exciting Drunk On The World the world be still getting over at Universe expert I like that word exist before we would say he's an expert at you know Plumbing expert persons that seems like it's a problem but thing about that sober with that let's go back to ludvig and his statement you know like like he said I don't know what we're here for but I'm pretty sure that is not to enjoy ourselves
 and then you got a bunch of non sober people people that are drunk on the world's famous is going to be such a buzzkill
can you get drunk on the world and you can't see that this guy is making an intelligent statement like being a buzz-kill. He's just trying to understand something deeper to it wasn't that he was a grumpy old Sourpuss sure it was that he was trying to to to to to look through and see what more is there so yeah it kept on the world at war scheduled trunk because it's the romance of Maya example in Imagine Dragon up and go stupid trunk like how do you feel when you drunk to get horrible you know you feel dirty feel you know you never been drunk though I think they like over there in a bit by their kind of yeah they forget about the lobby and do stupid things at the end up falling asleep on their face sometimes urinating in their pants I think you think you look cool and the rest of the world is looking
different things you're putting other people in danger you're driving home drunk and if so is it actually joyful or have you painted the haze around the material world I love you I love you right so that's what the material world is if we put a glaze on it and we try to live in the romance of Maya so when you become a little sober
 you become a little thoughtful and not negative but you just see the world as it is that's enough to make a person depressed and that's why without the bach the element of it the whole thing can actually get very depressing because gotcha this is what existentialism is they actually have Stripped Away the romance in the material world like what are we doing just trying to create Hobbies okay they're going to bungee jump not going to now I'm going to whatever you think thousands of things to do to take up my time give it some type of Adventure and it's just sort of just chewing The Chew
Raze ulfat have fall in love and go through that and perhaps we could be the trade perhaps one of my kids might die now they're not going to do the material world is suffering so what's the joy that Joy is not of this material world is deeply connected with our spiritual self of sobriety
 you no speak about being drunk on the world in all the years I mean I don't want to get too into this but it's like because in one sentence gossiping and it's but like in the news lately you know there's like a big stories is how this famous music producer right like his home to being raided by the FBI because he's been accused of many by by many many people abused by many men of of you do sexual assault having these crazy parties into it like it's it seems like a lot of people saying like all the stuff is going to come out about like hell are these celebrities with people
they like if you look at someone like that music producer he had certain talents and certain Vision certain inside the stone abilities of how to Market things and you know yeah
 buddy but his he saw the goal of this as we are here to enjoy right the opposite of what you know Ludwig was saying that it was saying I'm thinking about life and I don't think the purpose is to join he was saying is here to enjoy and therefore he was just into Fame fashion money jewelry sex and itches and you you live if you get drunk on on the world like that and it and it when you reach the peak of it like I've got more money more fame or it's got it it's got to get it gets darker and gets darker green get its exhaust pipe it's exacerbated you know a lot of people are Lusty but they can't feel their loss so they just sorta like live in their head or they go to pornography or something like that
but if you have the facility for lust and you don't have this moral compass and there is no more or just your Fame and your power can get it it can be overwhelming to very dark places I'm not even say that of course condemning all that stuff but I don't necessarily think these people are naturally all bad I think it just lost control its lost control it's like an unqualified person trying to be an electrician and you have to become very very qualified electrician how to deal with these energies of this world that's that's nice seeing it again and again with gurus there had a nice devotees really nice to tease and the energy
 and people are bowing down
worshiping that has God and they just can't handle it they can't handle that energy it's it's really nothing personal it's it it's like it is very very difficult to handle I mean I don't I don't have to worry about the beauty thing but some people are so beautiful they can do whatever they want they can get away with stuff and they can use that beauty as a currency to manipulate other people and it gets overwhelming to become narcissistic and they don't even see it happening to miss it it's Insidious they do people with wealth it's the same thing I got hang around people that want them for their money and they start to purchase people to start treating people like things are objects and it because it becomes it becomes hard so if you do hats really important what you just said Robin it's really important as people try to make things again if we go back to Ludwig he's saying if if if our conviction is that we're here to enjoy ourselves
 then at least that's wanting to enjoy other people
and and and in that of objectifying people like
 it's all revolving around me this person's existence
 I see in terms of my enjoyment sure that right there that the potential for danger so high right to that work but it's so hard for people not to see that way and what to speak of when you get really drunk on the world sheretta what is speak of if you're hanging out with a collective of other drunkards we can have everything you're hanging with a bunch of super wealthy people all do the same type of intense enjoyment so-called enjoyment but really I think you are the center prostitution if they say things like well you know I'm just helping this girl out give me a break you're so intoxicated in this in this addiction
 it just going to get darker and darker and what's real
