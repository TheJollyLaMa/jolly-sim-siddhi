 dear was going to say just how are you both listening to was with sages on a regular basis for the last four or more years has allowed me to go deeper into my spiritual practice and an unforeseen byproduct of that engagement Every Morning has been to take my physical practices of running walking strength training and Asuna and trying to eat more carefully all the more seriously interesting it has a positive physical effect listen to The Bog of time might be the first time I've ever heard that
 you and Gina
 listen to sages in Gina but it's the body recovery group have spoken of the need to replace bad habits with good ones how in Krishna consciousness
the idea is to hou and Krishna Consciousness the idea is to use what we have for our upliftment
 I like this so much and have found that sadhna and sunga have helped me shift out of some less healthy habits
 striving to do better and to be around people that can gently show me my blind spots and help me progressed I'm forever in debt to roget the stupid Mara for bringing to life the stories from the srimad bhagavat time Shanty the holy name in addition to the teachings about SRI chaitanya just sending to Earth as an avatar of Krishna in the mood of the highest stability ride her the teachings on Karma and reincarnation and seeing the spark of divinity in each being the teachings on Avidia or misperceptions of who we really are the teachings on the eternality of the Soul
these now shape my days and have help me manage and natural vicissitudes of daily living on the material plane
 I can assist this isn't hoods you like that you can use it look it up use it today and then get your own special way that you all three and gas bring them in a teacher's to life make it palatable
 thank you expressing your humanity and vulnerability makes me feel more human as I listen daily

it's like sitting in the shade at hardcore seeing and you know knowing some krishnacore kids and what not being with you is that seed back and then you know I got
 I got to get up you know as it is at that time I tried to read it cuz really penetrate that much then but if it just like it felt like home anyway like to stay all the images I don't know it just felt so familiar so right and but I also I just felt I felt like it wasn't for me and I wasn't allowed into it at the time I was the only one keeping myself out but I don't know I just felt like I wasn't I felt like I wasn't gifted in this life with
 I don't know which way whatever it takes to be a religious person I already took live surely but I had this feeling.
say I were to be that type of person this is the one I don't know I just had a feeling about that but then I kind of put it on the back burner but then you know that point at some point but you know at that point it wasn't anything that felt I bet you or life ruined any other kind of you know socially granny game fast forward a bit when I was 19 my my father passed away from lung cancer you know has taken the pilgrimage to India is like a pilgrimage to the Dunkin Donuts downtown right and the other direction
 I don't know what my dad is passed away from cancer and there's no hard enough painkillers around and stuff and that was there
now there's they're like it's a growing up grow up grew up with skateboarding and stop that you know what down a bad path and became a deck so I don't know I just was on a path of self-annihilation and ice
 I seek out a heroin addiction like it wasn't like it was fun for a bit I was already and you might have got away from being but the intention was for it to go bad and if they go bad for a for a chunk of years you know popping in and out I would you know detoxes mod stairs and what not before and not see your father dying to sort of perpetuate just it's spun your life a little bit out of control mixed with maybe just
19 year old
 19 year old not yet being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and trying to strong-arm way for depression
 yeah you know at the age I was you know the combination of my dad passed away all my all my friends going off to college and anyway so I know how to make 6 or 7 years deep into heroin addiction my wife I'm about 18 years ago and you know I quickly quickly very easily and anybody but
because I just needed a lot trying to lock down I would call me later then
 you know Al what one evening I had a dispute with some neighbors over some loud music I had to drinking
 and I was angry and you know I didn't deal with my anger about their live music Sunday night very appropriately but it ended up with like three people coming into my yard softened and I don't know if they had people on top of me and couldn't breathe without having to have to be slammed into the ground she back in the head
you were you were drunk or really intoxicated and are at your house they were playing loud music and you screamed at him or something screaming like a maniac okay if I heard someone say yeah buddy I'm not like trying to say is my fault that it. I was stopping this early but I do recognize not me being drunk on your right at Billy thank you for sure for sure getting my breath for a second and then just any song by The White Stripes. On my way to the house shopping for something while I was happening but they pulled up in the driveway while it was still go
people scattered and I just saw my wife get out of the car with my infant daughter at the time in your car seat. My daughter's face right away and I just I knew that I knew that I couldn't be the life that I was making for her but yeah so that that's what I really do get in cards to spiritual study and daily meditation practice and stop asking about a year before wisdom of the sages but but that's what really made me die you know actually die then you know
 yeah maybe just like really got more interested then seek out yoga practice so then what not do it without a few specific people you expect
who is the bog of a Tom the fat to do on a regular basis on a regular basis
 in a very interesting as you say all the time it takes takes me out of you know me being in there looking at myself in the center of it it's it's it's the prescription I need everyday more than anything like he started this has ever given me to go through the world because
 I do not want no matter what
 no matter where I am I remember where my head is that
 I have to ask you if shearing the show in the morning
 it just it's not always like a magic wand that that fixes where my head's at or anything like that but it always sets that's me in the right direction you're always
hours feel like a ground puts me in a place where I am now capable of making sound decisions and not matching couple places emotionality I'm here. It locked me into a mindset of
 looking at the world logically and scientifically and end with my service first and foremost this beautiful that's beautiful and I really and I think I'll be having everybody want to appreciate your vulnerability to because just to share that gives us sort of permission to
 realize like we're a little bit of broken in this world and when someone could actually stay up there that their struggles and what they went through it makes us not want to bury our past was sort of like share it with people that we trust
can and therefore confronted and deal with it and if it's quite beautiful how you overcome with the help of community and God and family to propel you out of that mud quicksand so to speak and and you're thriving new hobby / business of Timothy Tucker t-shirts where was your day I wish you wouldn't be anything right without your encouragement and help with that for sure loading it yeah but if I guess I can mention if you're interested. They ask me for it is a t-shirts. Etsy.com and my Instagram is a t-shirt
 and if I can imagine that my wife's Instagram for her new culinary
Arch catching us we think it would be spelled so check that out as brand new son so this is on the board we're really happy I'm really happy for your family you have a beautiful family and good to meet you in person at that show the other day and you got a community of support behind you and thanks for being part of this community for boo thank you I didn't want to mention shut out the cash and everyone in my group but oh great and thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to everyone
 beautiful thanks for the great share
 that was beautiful huh
 it's great to hear people stories and sometimes when they come for like these play like actively searching out addiction that's like that's like the fast track towards hell that you're actually looking for it to get
pain and when you hear sometimes it's not in the steadiness but in the I was in hell and now I'm not in Hell anymore and this is what I did those are the things I can really inspire you when you go through these complete makeovers of your life
 I'm so tired by that Cher
 yeah
 all right let's get you a a letter mayor or those letters
 and I lose it
 okay are this is from are you going to Kishore
 you could Shores interesting guy he was just with us in California he's a daily listener he and his wife brought them on though they both live in southern Californians in Encinitas
 and he was following me around last week with McKenna Kishore and doing videos for me I just posted a video that he shot but they're both professional photographers
Banshee was been a devotee for a while now maybe 20 years if not longer but he was sort of never into it they were just married he was just watching his wife into it so he's really
 a Hare Krishna kaszuba Maracana please accept my sincere greetings their devotees my devotional name is you look at short notice and I am a disciple of his Holiness badri Narayan Swami in San Diego California
 I hope this letter finds you in good spirits personally I like to extend my heartfelt congratulations on reaching episode thirteen hundred people happy 1300 1300 to be okay if you call me later
 my gratitude for granting me the opportunity to share the impact of reading hearing a discussion to chew my bottle of time has has had on
I live through this letter I also want to express my sincere apologies for my absence Tuesday mornings are dedicated to attending our temples morning program
 this is who I am I hope it's okay but I thought it would be good to offer a little perspective as to where my life was before becoming a devotee I'm currently in my 50s I used to eat meat and drink beer occasionally and at times I over drank a format former teenage drug addict who made many offenses to others including my family I betrayed people's trust in so many ways I acted selfishly to get ahead
 I like to humility and had an ego the size of King Kong little did I know that I was My Own Worst Enemy
 I was simply going through life in a way that society and my family had expected of me I was living in a place where I was worried about how others perceive
how much money I had in the bank and how well was my business doing never thinking of confronting who I was who I become living in complete anxiety and trying so hard to control all these external forces to become happy
 what do you think of that so far positive I'm interested to hear where this goes yeah
 look here comes a happy ending I think
 I understand death 2016 have been particularly challenging for me with the profound loss of both my parents
 this is a reoccurring theme they were involved they were involved in a tragic car accident days after the accident I held my father in my arms in his final moments that must be it's hard enough to lose a parent Malaysia losing both your parents at once
 and despite my best efforts to support my
mother in her grieving and healing process she to passed away 6 months later
 during the funeral I listen to family and friends speak of stories of how hard they worked I thought I thought I worked I thought we worked hard for what none of that matter anymore I started to question my purpose it was a life-altering experience one that I struggled to come to terms with four years these are Big questions because culture has us working so damn hard just to wear the basics and then sometimes you meet somebody who's just wear like living a sort of a simple life and you think I don't know I have a simple life why that complicate my life so much and what's what's the Y
 that was the topic of my last little Instagram post what's the why behind while I'm waking up when I'm going to work in the morning what are you doing
soon after my parents passed away I received an email from the garage he does go Swami I held onto this letter for many years as he wrote this while in Maya pour battling with his don't help cuz he he left his body due to cancer
 he shared with me that according to Vedic philosophy cuz my parents are Spiritual Beings they are now living in a body where they have the opportunity to continue unimpeded to make progress towards inner Perfection happiness and love Krishna is the source about love and he is waiting and he is just waiting for us to look his way to find it it is set of the Sacred texts that if the family member of a deceased relative turns towards Krishna that deceased relative enjoys great spiritual benefit what better way than of showing your parents how much you love them then to chant the Lord's Holy Name serve him in some way and pray for His blessings
okay so that sounds like he was getting into Krishna to serve as parents who have passed away
 so fast forward to 2020 my wife brudge Mandela was listening to an interview featuring his Holiness around us Mommy and Ogden off all your podcast
 as we listen to their insights I found their words resonating deeply with me it was as if they spoke my language and I began to find the concept of bhakti increasingly intriguing okay so he still wasn't in the box at this point
 keep in mind since my wife was a devotee I was exposed to talk to him anyways I travel to India with her I met and spoke with Swami's and attended festivals and home programs they are there were so many occasions that were directing me to this path but nothing resonated with me like this podcast over me people like that for some reason
they're always at the temple to visit the temple they know devotees but they're just not into it if we need people like that has lots of people like that out there yeah Jen page Mara says her husband was a devotee and she just like go along support it
 it's a thing like that
 an interesting thing is if the person's just supportive even if they're not into it or support of it they make so much benefit with in this lifetime
 in the coming weeks I delved into the podcast so he had a little a pivot here
 and gradually my conversations with my wife took on a different tone as you were talking on a level that we weren't talkin on before mean that there's a meaningful less superficial deeper
 which is like
it just creates like a a strong foundation in a relationship deeper than just companionship deeper than just sex deeper than just you know these things aren't that that hover on the top
 the page after page podcast after podcast the teachings of the srimad bhagavatam provided the answers and guidance I have been seeking encouraged by this new-found understanding I called to cry by to crumbs the local temple president of Laguna good friend of ours I called to Crime for both seeking advice on how to deepen my practice of Opti coincidentally Rock were visiting the Laguna Temple at that time
 expressing my sentiments to to Kura I remarked on how bhakti resonated deeply with me remarking this path just makes me just makes too much sense what should I do in the background rock it up interjected right this is me just butting in
your Association Prabhu change your Association surround yourself with devotees that's me doing in there are they are amongst the kindest most merciful individuals sure his name was yeah I do remember then we're on little cousin Laguna temple in the backyard and he was coming around into grams
 for the past four years it's been four years since that
 has been for years I said I thought maybe they'd hide and dedication over the last two there you go I have wholeheartedly immerse myself in the practice of bhakti under the guidance of a Bonafide spiritual Master I've taken initiation committed to fulfilling my vows
the principles regularly I diligently chant my rounds and actively engage and serving the guru the San Diego Temple in the community
 bhakti has permeated every aspect of my life I still grappled daily with the challenges posed by my mind and navigating the complexities of the material world instead of blowing up and anger it's saying things I would later regret I've learned to it listened attentively address the root of the issue with patience and understanding I traveled the holy places on pilgrimage to understand the past time to the Lord and deep in my practice viewing my wife as a blue love a devotee of Lord Krishna I strive to honor and cherish her as such a beautiful serving my Guru is to serve the Lord Krishna myself have more discipline weekly routine I utilize my skills as a professional photographer and filmmaker to serve the devotees at our Temple
 here's realizations the daily immersion in the teachings of the Bible time have
build to me that the roots of my challenges like both externally and internally while I may have little or no control over external circumstances I've learned that I possessed the power to shape my internal thoughts is far simpler to attribute my anxieties conflicts and shortcomings to external factors to find something or someone to blame and complain about this approach absolves me of responsibility and protects me from the discomfort of change you through the podcast I've come to a sobering realization the true source of my struggles lies within I had to find strength from within recognizing this has been both empowering and daunting
 wow that's a spiritual path underscores that I alone can resolve my inner conflicts and overcome my limitations learning to regulate my reactions and control my senses is pass
the transformation is neither Swift nor easy it require steadfast dedication and willingness to embrace discomfort get I've come to understand that the last thing change begins with small deliberate actions each step building upon the last gradually moving forward
 great realizations huh that revolutionized my perspective on the world I've discovered a profound sense of joy and contentment unlike anything I've ever experienced their moments when I feel utterly consumed by it never wanted to cure times to end or the bottom of time class to conclude I yearn for more time in the company of devotees eager to learn and serve the best of my ability
 in closing I want to express my gratitude for the transformative impact of your podcast by teachers and the devotees have had in my life you're teaching in the wisdom share to the platform have provided Solace and guidance during some of
darkest moments I hope this letter conveys my deepest respect and appreciation happy 1300
 you can look a short. It's a beautiful thank you it was really nice
 inspiring hearing people's transformation
 alright Mara
 are we going to bring it I think I bring an island shoveling she's a regular Zoomer and Krista to feel free to comment on any of this if you want to comments or you get some relaxation yourself or appreciations
 it's really nice to find just people that you don't know and hear their story or sometimes we know just a little bit when you hear their story and what they went through it's quite inspiring No Doubt
 Eileen shovelin welcome to the show
you've been doing great okay we call her her nickname if you're on Zoom often times you get a nickname for nicknames been shoveling the mercy shown the mercy tell your story what's your story who are you where you from and fog latam every day how you stumbled upon the podcast at cetera enabling us to be here and thank you for the two of you cuz I know that this is krishna's work but having you be the conduit of that and using your wisdom in your experience to bring this alive for us has been nothing like changing said thank you so much thank you I love you I'm so I'm from outside of Philadelphia and I was brought up Catholic stores kind enough to have personal plant that seed from birth but I will say you know fast forward lots of material success I had my son when I was in college so there was
a little a little Mercy. Really unfolded as my life went on and the corporate life and in 2020 I started kind of dealing not innate like lack of purpose lack of fulfillment and where I had judged my life on how much I could achieve for my word I realized how empty I had made me and my first Christian maracle was being drawn to a retreat up in Vermont with Katie Richardson from Long Beach Island on History go pee and I was going to see why I don't know that's what I was doing a little did you know in there and listen Christian maracle after that was I did start working with the story really just help me remember Krishna and simultaneously I met you you did a flight school in Long Beach
because I had heard of your time really was drawn to back to back your time you were doing with your time and in the class and the storytelling so I actually got to meet you in 2021 by accident and but it wasn't by accident obviously and then the Krishna Winx the god makes just started happening I went to another Austin to class and was introduced I'm So Beautiful to go to Andrew and then I love you I had never met you,
 that was the first time I ever step foot in the temple and with me the baggage time do you need the courage to do that and then from there I started going to Temple and and shout outs like you C W in San Marcos or just embracing you walking in the temple and make me feel so comfortable and yeah so it was kind of like dominoes that started and once they've removed it was just nonstop so Krishna
you know fast-tracking you know a little bit of my associations for really help me you know on cover who I really am so it was a really beautiful day and still still as still it
 was there any trouble with your Catholicism and getting into Krishna bhakti was there some tension there
 why is because for me what was missing from Catholicism for me was that loving God that personal relationship with God and so once I was able to hear the mercy of Krishna and how Krishna is there to be sad when we fall and he wants to lift us up and he wants to be our best friend and walk alongside us to me that complemented my cuz I was so much so I think it first I thought it a little bit of like going throwing off the Catholic but I think in the past couple years I've really seen the beauty and I think I'm showing
how different faiths can't I know you don't help us understand God in many different ways and how bossy really Elevate that tastes so I think of me being a little bit cuz there was a struggle but I think long-term it was just such a gift that I had that in my life super Catholic are you you have all the prayers you Penance Community School strong-armed by their parents but you were sort of in it you were like in at it waiting for the time everyday I think that consistency and that you know daily routine has helped me because of a better devotion because
dean of hearing the bog good time led to a routine of you know who's up every morning and that led to a routine of gratitude every morning before I got out of bed and so I think the importance of habit is really part of why the show has been so warm it up for me. You know as you get in this habit you learn to see God and everything right so as you go through your day and have this routine I can see Christmas hand you know in my life before coming to Krishna Consciousness and I can see daily you know as I hear what the stages have gone through and what different devotees in the struggles they had you know I'm able to see those God makes those Christian maracle those that hand of God in my life because I can apply what I'm hearing from from the book The Time
 another beautiful story and I think that count ability I think it's a problem with also like the perfectionist
is that we want to be perfectly want to speed this up and I think the way that you and that God cannot do you enter the Super Bowl have put this show together it helped us get like 1% better everyday. The bite-sized pieces the short lessons have really showed up at the progress is so important in the Perfection is really our fault you go talking and that you know these little jelly stuff that we're taking up that wrong I really have you no lasting impact and so whether it's you know how we look at our relationships in our life who we surround ourselves with our secrets. You know I've been probably one of the biggest impacts you know the show us how do you know helping us cultivate our service and listening to the stories of your service and then obviously the devotees in the bag of time and then just how we spend our time so we can we call you know this piece that you've helped us develop I listening to Bob the time has just elevated
what I do on a Friday night now you know going to the garden for your time is a lot different than you know heading out to you or you know I'm spending the morning with you know some beautiful devotees and you know spending my Thursday nights at the Philly Temple so you know that that's nice that you've enabled me to cultivate through the listening and hearing prayers that you helped us learn has just you know just really helped me blossom
 Bill's got six dining thank you Eileen that thanks you for sharing to I think we all love grow a little bit here in hearing everybody shares
 costume so we have we have another we're going to go a little bit over in that one we're going to go another reading and then we're going to have each recently come on
 merry whatever this I'm feel like I've been reading too much this is this is from Rick Lasher
he's from where she lives in Taos New Mexico he's a regular Zoomer but he couldn't be on today but he hears his letter that interesting some people say Rodger like a stupid Mara and some people. Sometimes people just cut Mara right out of it they probably confused I just give them are the credits he just made the choice he just said run out of gas too it's okay that I have for the daily association with the wisdom of the sea just community and sacred study of the bottom of Tom it's beyond words I was raised in a middle-class home and raised by my parents became Evangelical Christians when I was in high school and got out
 and got a bad taste I did not believe God could damn good people simply because they did not submit later in life I married into a Jewish Family my wife and I have been married 22 years and we've a 19 year old son in college about 7 years into our marriage we started having problems mainly
location issues and a lack of awareness and support I provided my wife during the postpartum period of our son's early years
 during this period we started marriage counselor or therapist was a very spiritual person they recommended that we attended yoga / Meditation Retreat I did not even know what you and I'm sure I did not want to go I was into drinking beer and racing mountain bikes and retreat was for sure going to get in the way of those things The Retreat ended up saving our marriage but not only that it cracked open my heart and a deep appreciation and love I have for my wife I was asleep and you don't get started to wake me up from there I was hooked on yoga everything about it I sought out the best teachers went to 200 our teacher training travel to India and soak up as much of the philosophies I could I learn to maintain a six-day-a-week Asana practice and Ashtanga Vinyasa and my life completely changed my password
Eddie stern was on the wisdom of the sages podcast I was totally blown away and started listening in the summer of 2020 was on probably in the beginning of 2020 right
 but yeah I think so
 and Eddie Stern mucus to Blue's big part of that community in New York City back in the what it was at 90s 2000. 2009 is it from Taos cuz yeah yeah house there's a whole lot stronger yoga world and
 Hanuman worship going on there
 text Hugh on I became a Zoomer October 2020
 what connect to me most was the teachers are going to Stupid humor honesty and humbleness was refreshing I've seen a lot in the Overworld humility and humble this especially not something I was used to
I felt a little stoicism going on Gaston Community isn't it what do you think I mean there's different things with a physical body that probably could Prevail his daughter like would be the hero is the ones who can do the second series or third series and I also started becoming very aware that I was a good Yogi in the shallow the minute I left and hopped in the truck all my anxieties and aggressions were left unchecked truck till every morning that was enough
my ego fed off there's all to my Asana practice which led to injuries that's another important thing for yogis out there too sometime sweet we start off for the spiritual reason gives me some spiritual pay back showing up on a regular basis connect with my breath mindfulness Newfound Freedom within the body and then I can cross the line to yeah I'm open and better than this person right competition interesting when I first started listening to the podcast I was not familiar with through my bag over time and had limited exposure to pack of Akita the podcast transformed my understanding of the real meaning of yoga which is self-realization and the last relationship with the Supreme purse now they've got him
 the podcast has been a springboard for daily Association of my teachers and like-minded spiritual Seekers
the amazing privilege to be in stage groups for which I've grown as a devotee through friendship and weekly study podcast is open lifelong friendships travel in groups like Krishna West myself and I feel so blessed to be here one final reflection it's so interesting how the podcast seems to dish out the medicine I'm exactly what I need almost daily well it's funny because I hear other listeners have the same experience beautiful thank you know someone just told me their father passed away just yesterday and he had to go to his house to declutter that house and we just had the episode on decluttering your Consciousness yet thank you Rick that was beautiful up here in these stories
 and he's visited the farm to he's come flowing in this to the farm for I was going to say just Retreat and
looking forward to seeing him and India is beautiful. The community is an unexpected pleasure for me as well I love hearing how this age groups are playing a big role cuz I know making friends and having someone to talk to about this it's so important and I was like there's something more comment is now we're really starting to get to work we've been talking about this for a long time but we're getting some traction now we're working towards it is going to be coming
 the sage Academy is going to be really thorough way to learn everything you need to learn to practice bhakti the philosophy the practices it's it's starting to come together
starting to come together I think I let you know I'm picturing people in future you're saying all that I'm going to say you up and then when I got in the Academy of really start to learn everything I think this is going to be really important thing
 beautiful could take some more time but who knows maybe by the Fall or something like that will have it up and gone
 rights we have one more person that you speaking of sage groups yes he's for centuries been so essential in helping us pull them together and organize them your great service she's doing she's a great contributor to everything that we're doing Easter Sunday welcome to the show
 thank you and thank you so much for that service it's really been a joy to do it and leaving so many people along the path so in the interest of time I am not going to go through my back story I'll just sum it up don't worry about it don't worry about it there's no clocks here I got to work hard times
I'll just get your story I just give us summary of I will say I been tripping and stumbling through challenge of my whole entire life from birth I think and I come from you know severe sibling abuse family ignorant stores that are turning a blind eye towards it's a little bit of childhood abandonment which has spilled over into adults so that's why I've been tripping and stumbling cuz I don't even know I had this, until way later on in life but I want to get to the good part and I already have been kind of in the Box E-Pass lollygagging through it if that's what you want to call it that's how I do all of life and 2019 I was at Super so far for the motor on a retreat that I used to call sweet baby sweet baby
places that impression up and I don't know why I would do that all the time and rock enough time correcting me but I invited the group to attend which is at 5 a.m. in the morning you were doing it in the dorm upstairs will you still have the three couches and up until then I have been so intimidated by the street I mean
 look how big it is and I didn't want to go to class and be embarrassed at the bhakti center I skipped it I did it $10 I did at 10 you know I did that stupid four Paths of yoga and other community groups and all that stuff but I just continue to kind of lollygag up until that day that you invited us but then I have another challenge cuz I was always
very intimidated by you rocking on that black and white picture upside down to avoid you like there was no tomorrow. The first person who said he want to avoid me
 I sat there and you will see
 so you know it was sweet and funny and then you started to share some stories I think you shared the monkey story with you and Maharaj and destroying his core book and all of that just kind of like all those that just let me intimidation dissipate like it was gone from me completely and then you guys followed that up with the bog of a tongue which I guess you already have been doing a bit with a stupa and Mara this is not new to you guys so you were a little bit into it already and for the first time
able to listen it actually penetrated through my very dense brain that did not want to get the bottom of them and I went in there feeling like even though I have been kind of like getting out of the palace and doing a lot of stuff like all this lollygagging and I just feel like I was still spiritually dense the deficit I should say nothing and that day I just felt like it went from the deficit to spiritual wisdom Lottery do you know it just like I just wanted the spiritual Lottery because it went from not being able to get it to say oh my gosh there is all this amazing knowledge out there being percent yeah like a jackpot being presented by to you know very knowledgeable and seen your devotees and what better way than that you know to listen to it so I was hooked and you know give me the zoom link I want to join this every day on June and that's how I started on the path and then on the thunderpath and then into the
podcast now there's not enough time in this spot in this session or in this whole year to tell you how much is benefit of means I'm going to share just one story and it's a very important one because it's what really shipped to me that he would go even deeper and just say hi there is no other option for me than this path thanks to the both of you I'm in 2020 January I was in yoga Maya and the one and only do when a guy has class and I was doing turn around go which I was to turn around and give me 50 60 of them a day I'm happy and I loved it I just loved it I don't know what it was about it. They just I went half way down and I just felt like something just ripped from shoulder to shoulder and neck everything and I went flat on the floor
 couldn't even put myself back to get into a child's clothes and then I was
I finally got into the child's pose and I saw you in a diet coming towards me and I'm like oh my gosh this is embarrassing but thank God I was in the back of the class and she said you are right and I kind of like we do I'm not good doing it so I finally crawled out of the class and I have to tell you it took therapy medication injections and nothing helped it was chronic pain since I was a child I have you no Billy O's and then wear braids for many years I just had spine surgery so wrong but I knew probably what it was but I was in so much pain and it took Insurance you know it takes you forever to get an MRI so then decides the doctor decided that the only way to solve this was surgery this took so long that my my my surgeries were scheduled a barge I guess I have been in
 March
funny funny we had a pandemic we had to quarantine no elective surgeries and this was an elective surgery according to them because it wasn't like trying so I was in pain for 24 hours a day non-stop I just sleep in the couch and I had to get everything is different to the front cuz I couldn't even dress myself it wasn't that bad and I'll tell you I think this is a Christian maracle but I noticed that the only time that I did not feel pain and I kid you not was from 5 in the morning to 6 a.m. in the morning while I was watching your wisdom of the ages podcast I felt I felt nothing and it was like and I first I didn't realize that it was kind of took a little bit of time and I'm like and then night when I noticed that I'm like this is not real but every time I was on the shell and live
specially I did not feel pain shortly after and the pain would just come back so I don't know if this was some transcendental your mercy from Krishna so that I could take him continue to take in the bag of a tongue but I definitely believe it was a miracle and just a little bit more and I'll be quick
 that's my challenges didn't stop there I wasn't able to have surgery until July but in in June of that year I already have been telling my life up into then was already extremely challenging I was like ready to throw in the towel and in June of 2020 I still don't have surgery I'm still in excruciating pain and I'm sitting in the couch in the living room and somebody very dear to me which I'll just for the protection of his you know identity came up to me and asked me for permission to commit suicide and I was paralyzed from head to toe I did not know what someone ask you
permission to commit suicide
 but I sat there and paralyzed and I'm a Krishna what now and I just didn't know how to react now July I'll tell you a little bit how that how that one but then July comes I have this surgery Unbound disarm is bound to my body and I am strapped it have to be mobilized for 30 days before they take the binding us not to take it off and on but then that was July 21st July 28th and walking down the stairs I felt like somebody pushed me and there was no one there I fell down the stairs and broke my ankle
 I didn't know if it's very comical to me because I laughed so hard after I fell down and I am laying there like little this is bound this was here I can't lift myself with this shoulder cuz this one has to have surgery to my phone is in my back pocket my ankles broken there was no way for me to get up and I am screaming at the top of my lungs to somebody
come and get me and everybody was coming out of four family building at the time my two boys have an apartment each and I had to tend and nobody can hear me nobody can hear me so I gave up and I just lay there ridiculously loud on the floor looking up at the chandelier then my mother had installed on the floor and I'm just I don't know what gives me the giggles in these times of like pain and sorrow or whatever but at that moment I remember you guys talking about being clumsy and cancel 1 8:20 5 just flooded into my head and it was broken I had to come back when I was another big ugly black thing on my body and I'm walking up the stairs and my kids are trying to help me I was so painful that you know something
ViaSat she goes home and you'll be okay I was in a car accident too
 in a car accident but all of that gave me the strength and then come back to this individual the stories the pain everything is just like at those moments when you're going through so much pain everything that you guys were teaching us so far and you know I'm not been like a year between the song Gotta and the podcast so that the wealth of information but I think about your nephew said this once like you have all this information to give her sometimes it's hard to pull it out right like and that happens to me but at that moment coming home from the hospital I sat down with my beloved and I looked at him and I said
 I love you and I know you're going through a very hard time and I'm sorry I couldn't react to it sooner but I want to let you know
 that there's a higher power that loves you you're not going to take your life you do not have my permission
because you can take your life your true spirit so you will continue forever but please stay strong and I will help you as much as I can if I didn't have the body of a second class if I didn't have this knowledge of I didn't know if I already believed in reincarnation by Chris speak about it cuz it's speaking to him and telling him this his eyes just like wide and he's and he's like
 you know wow I did not think about that like the only thing to take is your body that's all he going to take you you're going to continue to keep doing this over and over again and that was kind of the conversation that open that whole idea of suicide for him and fast forward to today doing amazing move to Gainesville constantly talking about the devotees and being given Prasad and his girlfriend just picked up the bug of agita and she's like this stuff is deep
