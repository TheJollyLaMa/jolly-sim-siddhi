 Shorty's Smitty's not minis we did a shorty is that posted yet I'm about to recover you got you got to make sure you check out the box recovery podcast go to your Apple podcast or Spotify repeat podcast I don't think on YouTube yet but where to get Podcast file them like them comment that we have builds the algorithms I think they're under self-help it just search for in your pot podcast on your iPhone or Android and that we want to really support people leading people on their spiritual path and it's a big part when the world is at dark times like this it creates space for a lot of light to enter also and
as the world I feel like it's it's moving in two different directions and we're going to have to like what do you want light or Darkness do you want love or hate do you want truth or Illusion and it's a mad it's as crazy but I was also a magical time and it's a time for us to wall sort of a springboard our spiritual life into higher and higher realms
 kasuba into the nuggets have Pacer yeah this you know this nugget
 why don't you want me to read and reason yeah what are you reading today this is from Steven Spielberg
 he's at he's a nugget Master himself do you know anything about his religious spiritual, he have like
 yeah it's a spiritual thing like like the Star Wars is like a spin-off of the ramen Jana sorts you got The Wookie who's Hanuman you got Princess Leia
you know you got that that you got Darth Vader who's like Ravenna
 you know yesterday we heard from Mother Teresa
 yeah and it was about silence and hard Creedence of Silence in the heart hearing the voice of God speak to you within that silence
 and what was the rest of it after that she said she said something about the prayer that's that's that's something to think about now she's obviously doing it from a very devout kind of person sharing this room very to develop perspective
 and I don't know you know where Steven Spielberg was in terms of his own spiritual beliefs but with Joseph Campbell they were connected deeply
Joseph Campbell has a lot to do with understanding storytelling and he's reaching back into what he would call the myths of ancient cultures
 but in any case so we hear Steven Spielberg's also speaking about hearing something that you have to be quiet to hear it that there's a voice he's speaking about in terms of like having a dream in like like having him when he says dream I understand is like a deeper purpose right like I have this dream of what special thing it is I want to make of my life and he saying that to hear that we might expect like those things are supposed to just like explode in front of my face like sit with something sign or something like that and he say no actually have to listen you know you have to listen very carefully to hear till I read it down this is when you have a dream
 it doesn't often, you screaming in your face this is who you are and this is what you must be for the rest of your life
time to dream almost Whispers
 can you hear the dream your dream I can't hear you forgot the drain so he said sometimes it is a dream almost Whispers And I've always said to my kids the hardest thing to listen to your instincts your human personal intuition now he's calling her that we might call the voice of the pot of Mach right
 and he singing this there's a center voices right so your instincts your human personal intuition it always Whispers and never shouts
 this is some interesting ideas very hard to hear so you have to every day of your lives be ready to hear what Whispers in your ear
 it's very rare that shouts and if you can listen to The Whisper
 and if it has any of it tickles your heart and
also interesting to try cuz he's saying you kind of feel it in the heart space
 and if so and if you can listen to The Whisper into tickles your heart and it's something you think you want to do for the rest of your life and that's going to be what you do for the rest of your life and we will benefit from everything you do
 okay so I mean whether he has like a spiritual religious Faith or whether he just had some faith
 in the human
 something about the The Human Experience that if if you're careful like we all have this voice speaking in us and if we follow it is not only good for us it's good for the world we we would say it's actually not our own voice speaking but it's the voice of our dearest friend that's in the heart of every one of us a raft of that of that friend in the heart and that friend does whisper to us and we can't find our Dharma week
and find our purpose we can through a lining with that whisper you know what life opens up in a very beautiful Dynamic powerful why
 if you heard that whisper
 thinking about this one thinking I got to listen to a little bit more and hear the whisper better cuz there's all sorts of Lucas level of Enlightenment cuz there are like like you know I hate to bring it there this early in the show but there are like serial killers who said you like like the my dog told me to kill these people you don't mean like if it was at his whisper but like where are these people like demented and then throw Lucas's enlightened can anybody hear that whisper in them
maybe he was a little bit more involved but well you know the thing is I think our face is you know it speaks to the idea that we need to want to hear it I think we brought up on the show not long ago the idea that when you go to like a deeply spiritual person light in person when you go to them to speak
 ideal you don't go to get advice you go for instruction
 write like a let me hear what they have to say and then I'll kind of way in and come with instructions is like this person has a level of perception understand that they are mine they're going to tell me some of that may be uncomfortable that may be challenging and if I want to benefit from this I'm going to have to get out of my comfort zone that they're probably going to nudge me out of that comfort zone am I willing to hear the instruction and I think we could say that that weather that voice is coming from a person outside weather
we would say whether God is working through the voice of that person outside or whether God is speaking to us from within if we're not willing to hear it we're not going to hear ever not willing to see it as instruction rather than merely advise then our our ability to hear it will be greatly decreased but if
 we really want it we really want that truth we really want to hear what it is that we that we we need to do Were Meant to do her or capable of doing if we really want to align with that invoice then we have to be opened it to accept it not just as advice but as instruction how to follow
 I like the whole sit with this I could sit with that quote for a a week and we'll do it again in a week and see what color will come back in a week we'll see you see what you do to me
 now what do you think of Siri
 right now I want to hear America
your inner Whispers
 I may be distracting us what you know and maybe heard anything as her whisper your what she might hear your whisper maybe when he's kind of in a half sleep Zone you can start whispering to him there like
 said I can start talking to my
 let me out blink man if there's any trouble
 alright we're going to cheer up it might have a safe trip announcement here the 28th of February 5th so if you want to join here's the link Merrill right on the show notes but any date spots that means like like nearly 300 have been filled and and that all split but I'll say this if if you
when you look at it and there's no spot that work for you because of the time slot I don't be shy to write an essay I want to join a group of the one that they're worth my time then they might be able to help us I'll take that sometimes you create safe groups yeah right just now showing up there a group message with leaders okay we'll find a spot for me and she says okay. And you the bag of time for a bill to Ryan I'm the musketeer that I'm driving a realtor mom David at 10 p.m. to talk to you before I start my. What time would you prefer me to Conquest one should offer respective agencies to the Supreme Lauren Ryan aren't you not even trying to reach you to shoot most human being to other stars Swati the goddess of learning it's true that the office today the author
give it to you tomorrow okay back there by 59 by regular Tennyson classes in the Bog of Tom and my rendering service to the pure devotees all that is troublesome of the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord of his praise with transcendental songs we establish its in rev a cool fact
 is my she go to bed, ha
 oh just got heavy like your Frozen and we just going to have a lag
 do you hear me yeah your pros and we just lied out baby you're Frozen Noel I can see other people moving but you're Frozen okay
yeah cameras off people going to do this sorry about that
 so we're going to see if there is a lag I think then we just speak in blocks
 I don't know if that helps
 me and maybe. But it's better than going back and forth quickly
 well if I take your leg and I can take over you season one of you started off while we're turn off all the cameras okay so long we are reading Sherwood Boggstown can't have seven chapter two entitled here on the couch with the king of the Demons were getting up-close-and-personal look at the demoniac mentality may be there within us to consider that sometimes when you hear about these demoniac qualities realize okay that's in me and I don't want that that's where my work has to be that's why it's good to hear about these are the types of good architects of evil architects of Greek architects of loss
archetypes of Courage cuz they move us in a sort of like Goldust forward in the appropriate Direction so we're reading our text 45 we have Ian Arash
 that the god of death has taken the form of young boy and that you know someone I forget who it was but thank you whoever was yesterday they sent in a little quote that said yes that I think was best for that truck already talked with said he took this boy form so that the ladies that he speaking to the wives of the king who was just slain on the battlefield they're all you know they got the mascara running down their face in there just crying and pound in the chest and roll on the ground and holding the dead body in the meant intensely so that he's going to speak some stotra to them
 I can speak he's going to be relevant in a rather blunt rather than coddle them he's going to speak pretty direct about the nature of the soul the nature of the body the nature of life
dad and I are in a chocolate bar to talk or the great commentator involved with Tom said that he took that form specifically so that they would kind of be more open to hearing such straightforward talk so now he's please continue this is text 45 which I think we should dip into the commentary on this road. If you are you are you upset you want to go and read it again in the body the most important substance is the life are but that also is neither The Listener nor the speaker Beyond even the life are the sole also can do nothing for the Super Soul is actually the director to those two Souls within us a Super Soul which is actually God in full
 and then there's the individual soul the spark of God seated next to each other Super Soul is actually the director in cooperation with the end
the super-soul conducting the activities of the body is different from the body of the living Force interesting point to be made considering in judeo-christian theology don't hear about the two Souls within the body and you don't guess there's you just hear Let me hear it but then they it's very confusing what the CIA is actually is actually I think the way they explained it
 it's so simple to understand if it's a live there's a soul in there cuz I simple is it in there then the par mom is in there as well with it so that God is there also
 saddle body and you got a mind to grow spotty it's really laid out quite simply and you know it mentions hear what it says that the body is the most important substance in the body the most
substance is the life are The Prana that's that light of the soul rest on that are but that also is neither the list nor nor the speaker so the speaker that's the self that's the soul Beyond even the life are the soul and now it says can't do nothing and what does that mean in any other way that I understand. Let's say you're sitting in the back of a car and I got to drive over there
 now you're saying you say turn left turn right go straight in one since you're doing nothing the drivers doing all the driving but it's your decisions that are that are one cause in the formula right like an order for us to drink to drive from one destination a to UnityPoint be
 there's going to be several factors that are involved and there's are
 give me the directions are saying hey drive me over there then there's the willingness and ability of the driver to do that then is a person that build the car and there's a person
got the car itself may not hold up yeah so for that to carry out there's a number of factors and buggy doesn't say there's a number of factors involved sometimes and emphasizes one and sometimes it emphasizes another right here at the emphasizing the cells ability to do anything because we think stand up and then did the action of standing up is facilitated by other beings who got ourselves is what the system and end
 but beyond that let's say you're in a car in and enjoy your saying okay drive left turn right go this way or that way what if the driver then also
 became very involved like another with the driver said you know what you're telling me you want to go left but I know that deeper in your heart you really want to go right and you know what that's the way we're going it's kind of like the par mom is kind of doing that it's going deep into you and it and you don't recognize your
and giving instruction according to at least we often use example of the turtles so that when they hatch on there is a voice in there and saying around 4
 yeah it on the yoga yoga communities always talk about The Prana It's All About The Prana you are you in a lot of like weight given to the prawn of it here it's saying actually The Prana a subtle as it is it's still not the self self is something beyond the prawn I hate even more subtle okay so the Supreme personality godhead distinctly says and about going to get to 1515 famous purse so I would give it to Corona but she's jumping in the river right now Sebastian has with your gal of my power and I'm sure I'm sitting in the car I'm sitting everyone's heart and
me comes remembrance knowledge and forgetfulness the soul is present in every material body
 he is not actually the chief person acting through the senses mind and so on and so can merely act in cooperation with a super saw because it is the Super Soul that gives him directions to act or not act batas Murthy Ghana map I want them cha this is the forgetfulness or remember it's more than one cannot Act without his sanction for the Super Soul is hoopa the roster and a new month pay the witness and the inner wanted studies carefully under the direction of a Bonafide spiritual Master can understand the real knowledge that the Supreme personality of godhead is actually the conductor of all the activities of the
but you saw and at the controller of the results as well although the individual soul possesses the in there yes or the census he's not actually the proprietor you know the fighter is the Super Soul consequently the Super Soul is called Visa case and the individual individual soul is advised by the direction of the Super Soul to surrender to him and let's be happy sarva Dharma and be transferred to the spiritual Kingdom where y'all at she have the highest success of an eternal Blissful life of knowledge in conclusion the individual salt is different from the body senses living force and the air is within the body and above him is the Super Soul who gives the individual soul all facilities the individual soul who renders everything to the Super Soul lives
very happily within the body
 report
 really interesting you know it's kind of like we're in a car that's like a Rent-A-Car the owner of the car is also driving we can suggest we go this way that way but the drivers ultimate going to decide where we're going to go we're just like the kids yelling go right go at 4 with a candy store and maybe we even these don't know where we want to go or we don't know how to get there and the drivers deciding whether or not according to our marriage
 we get to go where we want to go that's good it's like a meritocracy going on that's how Karma plays into all of this the Quorum of the beasts of the subjects that are laid out and look like the bug of agita in Dupont shots you don't understand how this world works yeah we are the spark of spiritual and we have free will you do about his it's limited we're we're in a body with senses that are provided for us to like we're going to rent a car that wrecked car has another owner that's in
car with us in deciding whether or not our desires will be fulfilled and we were driving around trying to find happiness again while the driver saying if you really want to happen so I can tell you that you don't even need to be driving around yeah it was interesting if a person has good, it's just like it appears like I'm the door say that I put my I put my nose to the grindstone I work really hard I've got what I want it's actually depending on there, but they're taking all the credit for it and if they're bad, they're sent it out that there's this you know rolling is it Rolling Stones Can't Always Get What You Want. That sounds right that's the story of the the Geva and when they are getting what they want the pic you have in the phloem in the flow well you're not the flows like a karma is in the floor right now yeah you can get on the float is a spiritual love it's connected towards Spirit then that spirit is moving you in there is a flow I believe but it's a spiritual flow otherwise
all just Good Karma and that whole flow can end at any minute at from one of the other factors of action that can just know your analogy the car and get a flat tire on the engine can over an overheat
 or the driver Misty May just decide I'm not going there. Are you wanted that but I mean if people you see who are like very successful in their life and I've lost everything they got like we're going to come out of the floor now I saved on the chat board shared on the chat board it says that me Estonia I hope I pronounced it wrong on my friend how she feels that she was moving when she's walking but her nerves are not communicating with her muscles make sure he feels she is moving when she's walking she is I think of a prime
he meant to say she feels she's not moving when she's walking that could be okay but her nerves are not communicating with her muscles she has fallen many times in last 2 years she's broke 1500 my God so here's an example of you know we're giving some equipment sometimes equipment breaks down we were this jealous part that has desires and whether those desires are fulfilled or not the many factors involved
 and in right now little little boy young Mirage is sharing this knowledge with these women to help Hannah break them out of the illusion that they or their husband had or have full control
 check 46465 material elements the 10 senses and the mind all combine to form the very
parts of the gross and subtle bodies the living entity comes in contact with the material bodies weather high or low and later gives them up by his personal promise this strength can be perceived in a living entities personal power to possess different types of bodies that this I can share a little from the commentary here is prophets in the human form of body is valuable
 what can you please cuz you have the equipment better suited for understanding or situation how to get out of it one can use his body to go to the higher Planters systems to the Peachtree Loca
 we can remain in the lower planetary systems but if one tries to get also returned home back to got it they can break out of the material realm this prowess is given by the Supreme person as the Super Soul that voice within therefore the Lord says
switch to get out of a pole and I'm shocked
 from me, remember it's mileage and forgetfulness if one wants to receive real Knowledge from the Supreme Soul the Supreme personally got it could become free from bondage to repeated acceptance of material bodies if you really if that's what you want
 you get that knowledge you get that remembrance if it's not what you really want then you won't get it right it one takes to the devotional service of the Lord and surrenders on to him the Lord has prepared to give One Direction's by which to return home back to doubt it but if I'm foolishly wants to keep himself in darkness you can continue in a life of material existence
 is that bag of agita the end of the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says okay I told you all this stuff now what do you want to do either opt-in or not it's up to you I told you that did you hear what I think is the best opinion my opinion God's opinion and you don't have to do it if you have this free will to do it and we like
send this morning or morning class is like you can be Krishna conscious right now you just got to want it above everything else that's got to buy your highest priority you were waiting to be Krishna concert on the way you can have a right to even have this moment and it is interesting you can be in bring Dobbin right now you could be with Cristiano right now but we have to prioritize Christian to a lower portion of our desires sort of on Krishna but I also want a I want a Little Krishna it's okay so Chris is going to give that and if you want to really forget Krishna full range that it could completely forget them he's that the he loves but he's he's that detached he could do that to her
 he knows he knows where it all goes in the end and he says towards you and you know he says have you heard this
with an attentive mind and all your ignorance of the end of the chapter have you heard this with an attentive mind to you if you really want to hear to understand that you know what your mind to hear that voice your that whisper
 I know your illusion and ignorance now dispels he says
 and this is the conclusion of the guitar June answers he doesn't say yes and now I right now that I'm enlightened my illusion is gone I realize I am you and you are me and we are all want you don't say that
 it says my dear Crystal infallible when my illusion is now gone I regain my memory by your mercy
 and I'm not frowning three from doubt and prepared according to your instructions. I live my Dharma down.
 All right yeah I think I like the analogy of a parent and sometimes you try to guide the kid and the kids like
what I got my own plan and sometimes your plan that you can actually see the disaster in the choices but you can't control them at a certain point and you just say okay you got it figure that out for yourself I guess it's a good parent is lovingly detached you know you can't be overly attached and lovingly detached and hoping to make a good choice and Christian is the same way you can see that micro in the macro you can see in the micro Krishna wants us to make good choices but ultimately real love means you have to let a person figure it out for themselves sometimes it may take many many more lifetimes as a parent
 a wise parent you must hit a certain threshold where you realize for me to continue to push my vision
 is actually going to push them further away from accepting it at like Linda's nodding when this guy and yes yes and yes
so then you have to like to know if if if you don't have a certain level of
 peaceful mind and inside and end attachment as you're saying you just keep pushing and you just keep pushing them further and further away from understanding what it is that you want them to understand yeah yeah
 okay where we at 6:47 as long as the spiritual is covered by the subtle body consisting of the Mind intelligence and false ego he is bound to the results of this route of activities because of his covering the spirit soul is connected with material energy and must cordingley suffer material conditions and reversals continually Life After Life
 it is fruitless to see and talk of the material modes of Nature and the resulting so-called happiness in distress as if they were factual when the mine
wanders during the day and a man begins to think himself extremely important and what he dreams at night and sees a beautiful woman enjoying with him these are merely fahlstrom's similarly happiness and distress caused by the material senses should be understood to be meaningless
 very interesting read right out of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita
 what were you thinking second chapter I'm thinking about their sparsha to convey us to push us to Paducah. What do you have to tolerate tolerate happiness and distress they're actually mental concoctions
 is an Envy actually analyze life for example put one hand and hot water one hand and cold water then put them both in room temperature water will one hand is going to say this water is cold the other tabs go see this water's hot everything is a mental concoction right now
we could focus our mind and every wonderful thing has happened to his right now or we could focus our mind and every miserable thing is happening in the world when you get depressed you know and that we create and sometimes we have a proclivity for positive things proclivity to see the worst in things everything is actually a mental concoction so we say project deposit for check the enthusiasm towards things that actually will give the soul Liberation as opposed to things that are actually going to satisfy you anyway people get worked up and excited about things that aren't even it satisfy them it's funny you notice when the mind wanders during the day in a man begins to think himself extremely important about daydreaming
 oh yeah I do not see it if I was walking into a me case for we want to we want to enjoy the taste of the fantasy tour mind
real and end in a in a sober person looks at me and says you don't even in ourselves and say oh God this is pitiful I got to live a real life imagine if you were
 in a movie theater and you had a psychiatrist sitting next to you
 yeah and you know the the the the content of the film that you're watching is sending you through different emotional you know experiencing to see you're off on plexus a Titanic silver watching the Titanic so good how's things going everything is so good right now are you going to ship fell in love with a beautiful wealthy woman this terrible help me catch you help me what what they was saying they wouldn't try to get you to try to change what's going on in the film
they would tell you you have to you need to realize like maybe this isn't the psychiatrist anymore not now maybe this is the you know that the saw do right this is the guru with the teacher is now saying that's because you're watching a film that is on a real and it's everything that's dragging you up one minute it down to the next is totally unreal so you just need to understand that and everything's going to be fine let me just share that I cried or times during this film which were when they were standing on that thing until one of the boat I was like
 I can't believe you
 just like all the people that I need for a film to stay awake just just like all this a good looking man
but anyway it's like every emotion was there then the saddest in the dread and then the loss of love
 I need to cry right now so in a sense the time when they got the orchestra was playing and this ship is going down and we still keep playing house like you I love you guys too
 can I say something in a sense of little yamaraja is doing in the form of the boys he's doing exactly that for these ladies right now crying so intensely you know you know cuz you are buying into something that was Unreal you thought that that body with your husband you knew you should have known work maybe weren't thinking about it but you should have known because we see it everywhere the messages are everywhere but that body is going to die but the speakers one is like regularly fight battles so emotional this isn't even real
it is said that this was fabricated the Titanic happen but this whole love story that's not real you know it's even maybe even not all though he's very direct and maybe not quite as blunt as that but just like your suffering because you're identifying with the Illusions being real and when you stop that your suffering will see if that's that's camera right that's that's that that the pain the suffering is due to ignorance and the and the knowledge directly counter is it
 sure who's the scariest movie that wrecked your childhood when you were little I want more I think about this to ruin your childhood is that would help their Chucky Chucky Exorcist it
 I didn't MMA
Mara Mara says Chucky 2
 I think I remember I tell you this one time I never watch horror films but one time I need my wife my wife and I are watching a film that's kind of like a war film we didn't even know it when we put them in pretty good like stalking his ex-wife
 and those are crazy or ex-girlfriend whatever was and then at a certain point it seem like you know how they do that like they make you think like everything is towards the end of Psycho it's all over now and then is one last second they got hand reaches out or something like that and you thought he was already dead but he was still alive you know he's still alive so when the whole thing when I thought the whole thing was over I said something to my wife like okay it's over now you know that she's safe and then that thing struck again
she actually got upset with me he seems like his homework until she was so frightened and she kind of like punched music you said and thought she was just like you did but you didn't want about the beautiful woman but the woman turns out to be a psychopath he stalks him what was that one that's been well traction we could talk about this
 cuz it's all illusion right so if we just understand and I'm struggling with illusion some of these things I haven't seen in years and they're still haunting I'm still like I'm still like thinking about sharks from Jaws had when I was 8 years old and I'm still thinking about demons and exorcism The Omen I'm still thinking about Little Chucky the doll like I was not real man you know and I can assure you that and you could just slap me say it's not real step away
you crave tomato concoction go because because
 it's obviously you know my wife and I sit here looking into a little computer screen you know and and it's obvious externally it's entirely obvious that this is entirely in real but her response was not only to like walk in the kitchen
 without lag I said it's so honry like you could just walk away into the kitchen and turn on the lights what we my point was yeah you were right in it and but she responded not only like with like okay I got it a movie to project she responded as if it were in Tyler and real and I was responsible for what happened on that screen or first you know what I'm saying it was it was it just shows how this rule the whole thing can be in there
when people see how can you speak to someone like this whose husband just died this is this is real you know if it's not if in one sense it's not real doesn't someone have to come forward and say it and invoice and what the text like the box I'm sending thousands years has been voices here telling us in a sense this is unreal in as soon as you know that you're released you become free
 I'll be interested in looking at you while you're still alive and we could still buy it's a dream I'm going to give you truth oh yeah you have to speak the absolute truth to Isaac Castillo you your whole thing dream your whole thing it's a dream you think you're better than me you're not exaggerating you to experience what I'm feeling now
hey this is probably right at the end of the, to you that's what he says
 he says the happiness one enjoys in this way is like the pleasure of embracing a young woman in the dream for some time and may be pleasing but actually the basic principle is false nettle concoctions of happiness in distress in this material world are compared to dreams because of their false all thoughts of obtaining Happiness by using the material senses have a false background and therefore have no meaning boom like that might drop right there I love it I love it

 what am I doing with my life we become like sober like for 24-48 hours of sobriety like what am I doing with my life which I'm not going to
make the most out of my life and then 48 Hours go by we go back into the Illusions like it never happened again but it's in that sobriety when we have and while we're on this Pilgrim talking all you guys out here while we're on this pilgrimage you will get a type of sobriety you'll get like a opening they were like wow I have some clarity more clarity than I've ever had don't let that slip away as you get back on the plane and head back into mile and mile Oka let that be back in time and hold it close to your heart and bring it with you cuz it's going to it's going to affect you in a very super deep way
