the world compelled you to come to this remote place in India to learn about your time with you to know anything about training face something like I described makes no Material Sciences wise old man told me because he's been enough around the Sun since I met him he had me snowed material since but I've just drooling to with your energy on your on the pill cost for patrol and here I am rich enough to reach really like that guy's got something going on and he's got some kind of music thing going on I'll go and try it and yes I admire that kind of openness you know the explorative desire

You were supposed to be gone by now then you like to know what I'm staying longer and you're here longer now I just puked on Academy and if so what's the deal why are you here longer you must got something out of this please explain yes it during the kitchen and the connection that singing from the Hops and I'm being turned off and being accepted is the first time ever in my life about being judged know but it does though some of you say that that's that's some depth I knew nothing about on Summit just drove me to listen to to your classes and workshops and just find a bit more about this cuz I have good principles in life I feel and I live in a good way probably you know more about fatness and morals but it's super nice to hear this side I mean my path
a great man he's not from ancient yoga techniques no just come back to the school to see if I like he's a teacher for like elbows with him all the time at Eton Academy what's the most extreme beat you've done time and yeah I think you copy of his plunge that to me while I was in my life is the most extreme thing that I've done but they're climbing up the mountain just sooner minimal clothing - 16 degrees and 60 kilometers per hour wind factor in snow
do the extremities is it sort of conquerors anxiety depression up because you have to like I got to survive here what are you doing that for the Dalian for me what am I going to do this summer is that it yeah I mean a little bit but very interesting concept about that her explaining don't think I should explain it all in

 Crossroads

 okay
Dominica come on down Dominica straight from Tokyo
 what's your story you're at your American but you're living in Japan for 30 32 years I think and I finished University and I worked through University as a nurse and was thinking of maybe going to law school and you to break and I decided to go to Japan and when I once I made that decision it just felt so right in the heart so I went I didn't do any research or anything I just arrived then send them everything was all these women here felt like the right thing to do is my my Dharma so I arrived and everything was my size so I Stay
I will say I'm a pretty big tough-looking guy in Japan know it was a really wonderful and everything was unpredictable and new and I really was ready for that in my life and I got some dumb I just caught on to the language and it was just yet so it was my Dharma and then I opened a yoga studio and I was doing Yana yoga and then covid hit I give up my studio I wish I wish I'd wanted to do before covid so we are good with the little push off the fence so they are big and I wanted to just teach and focus on you again focus on myself and I realized I needed something for the heart I've been in the head too much and so I was looking for some kind of podcasts to similar to Alex I was kind of looking for something and listen to one or two and then hit on with some of the sages and then binge-watched for like 3 days
listen to Avenged listens for like 3 days I was just hooked and wisdom of the sages Bender recall
 I can't miss the waves in the sages hangover
 and then I came last year to the wisdom training and lie down with him and it was so brilliant more than what I expected when I came with I'm a little bit of criticism not criticism critical thinking critical thinking is it really is true
 open up and it was it was all in the open up it's a wise freezer
 Your Truth my heart cuz your truth similar to like when I decided to go to Japan I just when I was there so I felt it in my heart my head to couldn't make a sense of it but my heart was really like yeah this is the thing to do
it was amazing and I and I took so much so many gems so many nuggets back with me and worked on myself more but throughout the year with what I've learned and continue to listen to the sages and get more involved in the bhakti center it said hello and then I said I'm going to come back for another wisdom training and then let this thing is really interesting and so my mom said oh yeah you should try curtain I said butt and she said no no used to do it and so Kate how was your Monday 6 minded open my lighter I am and how much more loving I am you are a thought you were always loved it and realize it was an old version of you
 I want to beat the grumpy old Dominica
 oh no you did
so yeah so they're all for you getting a lot of love on the message board from everybody but I got a question for you in Japan. Yes I am, but it's getting better I went to Kyoto Kyoto has a lot of vegan vegetarian friendly restaurants now they just have a really great vegan ramen anybody going to Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo is a little more difficult than we do have it but it's just hard they they open they close quickly but it's getting more popular now that prism is opening back up again and it's anybody heard of us and Japan besides you
 find out we can look at the stats but I'm definitely wisdom of the sages best.
send in Japanese and I'll check out the sticker site for Lady B
 Progressive on
 she's thinking it has anyone that you want know they're different for different things
 onwards
 Congo kanji
 okay okay don't get here yet
glad you're part of the family here to me ask you something interesting people here
 we should not I got over here so I'll still worry about talking about lately so yeah that you know last week I think it was sometime
 we tried I tried to come up with the story is another similar stories similar story music but either one of these stories can work till estate the point in Marin mention the horror story but it's a story that illustrates how you know where versus come in life to God things come in life we might be inclined to see them as oh how unfortunate but you really never know how the Puppet Master behind everything is pulling his strings right what's what seems unfortunate may be fortunate with seems fortunate maybe unfortunate Good Karma can be bad bad, can be good yeah it really you know that the wise person isn't
being swaying in the waves of this the kind of steadily moving in their Direction where the things seem like oh this is good luck with this is bad luck it's really it is really true and you can probably think of a few things in our lives that have turned out that way in the store Glacier my father dying was like tragic for me and it was probably so tragic it turn me an accelerated my spiritual desire My spiritual growth you know ends and sometimes the most tragic things that happened to me in my life that time I got beat beat down in Buffalo I was like the most experienced in my life and sometimes when things are going good great going great there's no impetus to go deeper internally it's only thing when things are crumbling around your like oh God what is this about and then he even learned to sort of like pull yourselves up look a little inside to find some answers instead of like standing around whenever things
I know you're living the life of what episode of that time there was an old farmer who had worked his who who had worked his crops for many years
 when day is horse ran away at a pawn hearing the news is neighbors came to visit such bad luck they said sympathetically you must be so sad we will see the next morning the horse returned bringing with it to other wild horses on a wonderful and they claim not only did your horse return but you received two more wood great sport what great Fortune you have
 we'll see we'll see
farmer the following day his son tried to ride one of the Untamed horses was thrown and broke his leg the neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his Misfortune now your son cannot help you with your farming they said what terrible luck you have you'll be the former military toucan script young men into the army seen that the Sun's light was broke and they passed him by the neighbors can graslie the farmer on how well things that turn out such great news your son must be so happy
 the man smiled to himself and said once again we will see
 but you get the point we'll see we'll see in an egg something they kept saying
it's all in God's hands of something like that and they just getting frustrated with that answer but it might actually be the wisest answer you know we read that we kind of red from that story about that Theodora of Alexandria yesterday you can imagine her circumstance like she was falsely accused of everyone thought you was a man and everyone falsely accused her of impregnating this apparently innocent girl right before she couldn't have done it she was a woman and is it is it
 so I kind of really brought the child back and they forced her out of the force her to accept the
child which wasn't hers and they forced her out of the ashram because she had done this and she just like rather than protest by rather than expose the other person reveal her true identity he didn't reveal anything she just accepted it she must have been thinking like okay if God has brought this child into my life work then then now what I meant to do is to care for the child reaches maybe she'll a clinician's
 that maybe. Maybe not we'll see you know but whether that was true or not what we do know is she accepted it she's accepted that fate and decided let me let me serve God in this way if if this is the way the world has moved
 rather than try to fight the movements of the world even though it on one level it appears on Jess
I'll accept it and I'll live with it and I'll keep my attitude of
 you know by Nature I'm a servant you know I serve god with in whatever whatever circumstances the world puts forward and I want to guard myself like she was when she instructors I want to guard myself while malice and I want to keep in my mind peace while I want to keep it focused I'll accept the child and I'll stay focused and so you know we could do I want a fortune in her circumstances were but she was more like well we'll see or more like whatever the case is I accept this is a good fortune right you know even what seems to be your bad fortune
 resume that perspective from the deeper perspective it can all be seen as Good Fortune I believe this is the bhakti default our life
 the return of life is almost like remember these old in the movies when they said Play the movie
like a 35 mm real and look at a movie theater by West projections the projection you were projectionists imagine you do and all those that there's thirty-five millimeter each one was a frame what future life or incident is the bill of sale and millions of different frames in it yes right and each frame there's a different emotion on your face supposed to write so
 sometimes you hear about these very tragic lovers I mean people grow up sometimes in tragedy and like it's just a tragic situation from birth then is a tragic situation in childhood youth you know teen light it it sometimes it's like this guy's never going to get it it's not fair
 this lifetime is like those frames and sometimes I could be going through
it was a scary movie that thing out and you're looking at one frame and someone's like smiling you think would happen or did you look at the like that they had that spinning around without just sometimes force and it's lifting a tire and sometimes we're going down hard right and some people experience that in this life hit the bottom so hard only to Spring off that bottom
 and so if if you see these tragedies not that we shouldn't feel compassion but we eat experience of ourselves we should understand this is a frame and a very very vast film it's not it's a moment in history our whole life I'm 58 years now
to me it's like a sneeze in time that I'm 58 years old I was a kid a moment ago moment ago I was playing something in a baseball my front yard moment ago and I'm 58 come on and so this whole lifetime is like a frame looking at show Main Street over here 22 years young just a frame old lady can don't get so all look at him
 the world works this is my world works that's time and then just running the film then the Soul passes into another frame this is a happy frame this is the destitute frame this is a good fortune frame this is the exploration for it and it's just going like this but we should understand that life with all its huge ups and downs roller coaster ride or some of the steadiness of a film right it's a steady time of the film it's always lifting us up and there's deep faith in that that Vishnu
benevolent lifting us to a higher place and especially as me gation Postal Service as we engage bhakti as we develop connection with the Holy Name of Guru then it's just like the whole this thing can happen real quick real happen real quick to her to our two are recoverable natural addiction the box of Yogi there's the kind of thinking and feeling and living on this platform of Eternity right sure so psyche these things in one sex like you're saying is a frame in the sense that it's like it's over quick and then is the next train is also like a frame like I'm removed from it observing it right so like OK you know Theodore she's like okay now I've been given the child and observing how this this world is moving and just moving through it as best I can but it's just like I know I know that this world is going to have me all these different kind of situation is handing me this now I'll accept it
and it's not that the person is weaker or you don't know actually that's like a real strength right it's not like I'm in other words, he said no fight for justice and stand up in in in in in but actually you could flip it and say that that's actually Beach right it's like you're unable to accept reality you're unable to accept what the world gives you know I'm strong whatever comes my way I can accept it and I don't have to desperately fight to change things that you want since I was when I can't even change right like we like whining like a child with okay I'll accept either that's a strong person that can accept a reversals in life without you know without crying about with whining about it fighting about it pouting about it I'll just accept it even if they're Sinners even some extra-special kind of
 virtue in it
 when you've been wrong and then there's even more virtue and it when you don't even work
that you've been wrong you know like now we're getting on that we're getting on that same field level you know like the other special people we can learn we can look at at those lives and learn from them take from them being inspired by the we have very little control in this life we tend to think we have a lot of control his very very little control except for our thoughts and our mind that we can control when we get it. Sweet wasted away we wasted a way we could call him and rage and anger and fury and we own to your eyes Embrace Fury and an end because of its like if it becomes it becomes the drops Stone in the pain we send a ripple effect of you know people that love us are feeling bad for us or try to take care of us or you know if it's a tie with us or adopting our Fury also better to be that
 stone drop that represents Peace of Mind sanity composure self control
nice
 Jose same like being close to Casablancas I can just go on and drop my hand yesterday about a friend of mine and she's like an older person euphemism for old what are you saying that Tsum her age like I think I'm
doctors are they are old guys with suits on I was like oh wait a second longer than the old doctors are all younger than I think because they're more complex that they're older than their Shadow crash I left a discount by the time now this is all about now isn't it we're talkin about that in today's and today's
 Easton training as people ask questions and there's an answer and that dialectic is there guess what that's the bottom of Tom perpetuating forward weather today
I was eavesdropping the bushes or are we are we are having a class today and then then like a group we could hear a group going by and they were chatting with a chance and brought a teacher or something like that and it would just wait a minute I'll be past but then we saw like it's like little children like all I came in from a buy some of that lovely little children in the Channing singing about dhiraj and Radha and Krishna and then they're going to going around and it's like a huge snake must have been like a real snake
 no it's like a sake of people take a few minutes
I hate Carolina so that's all I was just saying it's beautiful that people never chanting we're chatting back and their smile and we're connecting on that when David level their circumambulating how about the best text but you going to have the best text message I got from a kid has been 17 years old today I can just text me that song she Ronica stubba easy to plan a harmonium

 reading from the shoe mud bog time Kansas 7 chapter 1 text 13 thanks to taking a shift now
 up to this point the question was placed by
 by Marsh crickets should we do go Swami the question was essentially
 the Lord seems in the Lord play favorites seems like the Lord should be impartial like a parent a good parent is impartial I love you all why is the Lord play favorites to the demigod
seems like it could be the case but now it's an episode has been brought up as about to be brought up where it seems like hold it he's really kind of the Demons as well it has been a pretty good till the demons to yeah and I got to talk about shih Shu Paul was one of my favorite demons ever such a fascinating demon your son is going to come out about the nature of Krishna is a yoga concept but it's that if you bring your mind to him
 even if it's not like he'll always think of like religion we think you have to turn towards god with a certain attitude maybe humility maybe reverence maybe love will however you want to say he was actually Focus like a yogi on Krishna but with hatred yeah he was full
hatred for Christian with that hatred had him thinking about Christian non-stop it said that even when he's like a little kid before he could even speak correctly he hated it was just criticizing and you can cousin with him
 can remember maybe it'll come up but but the deal with principal there is that Christian is purified by nature to eat in for meditating on them and a hateful let's face it if you hate somebody it's like all you can do is think about that's deep meditation lost is deep meditation I got some rain in the son of King, Ghosh and the sister that she was with sister boss to Dave so they were cousins
 as well as the cousin of none.
crazy I need a family trait he was slain by Krishna in this slain by Krishna was like when you think about it so this person he was full of hatred like just raging is beyond normal animosity you want to see if I can extra arm irae something like like really sort of slightly deformed and you don't know which one but I don't know which one but it was like God was like this is going to be a tough kid to take care of her and but there was a prophetic voice when he was born at said
 three three eyes four arms thank you and three realize and forearms so prophetic voice not God but what is it what is it called
 Akash
call Shivani struction from the sky Bonnie and instruction permit
 akaash Vani instructions from the sky and it said
 whomever laughs you get put on
 and you heal
 that person will kill you so they're putting my cat try to put on people's laps this it's kind of like a mixed thing right it's like oh thank you for healing or something but you're going to get what you're so sure. Every time somebody come over they put my son in your lap nothing but my son in your lap on Chris's lap and all of a sudden all of the birthday for matiz go away
 and then she looks at Krishna Krishna why you going to kill my son said what are you talkin about egos Krishna please said you're going to kill my son
listen listen I don't answer your son you should listen you got to promise me Krishna you will never kill my son and she said was auntie
 hate what you say auntie in Hindi chart c h e I promise you I promise you your son can insult me 100 times and I will not kill him that was the promise he made so she felt very relieved but as they grow up will see and what time for you to steer to worship Krishna as the guest of honor since you posted up and was infuriated and start criticizing Krishna in front of the pain of us who are really Furious they were all had their hands on the Scabbard twitching right ready to kill this guy but sure enough
 grandfather B's man who understood everything
 grandfather B's with just looked at
said all good don't worry about it Christmas got this under control and Krishna was secretly counting insult number one and so number to it's something I'm 43 and he counted a hundred and a hundred Christmas stood up very calmly and he spoke all the offenses and all the evil things is Kick this is King was no sweetheart I was real troublemaker and Krishna listed all his defenses and then
 you manifested his sudharshan to Krishna has us for weapons before or things he carries the elotes right to Benedict the devotees song Sail to Benedict the devotees the mace or the club and the disc for the demons who manifested his whirling discs chakra and he threw that at the head of sheep effortlessly and it sliced his head off comes back like a boomerang weapon
head comes off the whole like religious function is like oh my God what is it like a like a wedding fail version of a wedding veil was awkward people are leaving the skirmishes broke on a little running for the Chariots what's going to happen it was just a little upset about it I was trying to think about the uniqueness of this because we see Christian and again if we're going to ever going to zoom out on this the whole story starts with the demons infiltrating the Earth taking birth in the royal families in the earth be like I cannot bear these Intergalactic major heavy-duty demons you don't gets bad on the earth complains yes North isn't generally complain so there are things I can't I can't bear this any one she's so she's begging for my child to help you and you're the big creator of the universe you're the one that brought sorry I'm not so powerful I can deal with this let us go to Lord Vishnu so they pray the Lord
Lord vishnu's Shores and that he's in, he's going to take care of this and that's part of his Intergalactic play right so so now you have shoot suppose one of these heavy-duty major demons and we see Christian kills quite a few or ranges for the death and ultimately the Battle Creek shakers to really read the Earth where there are two of all those horrible l l relay worse or they had a lot more power that's for sure and they had mystical weapons yeah they were sort of like Godly one since you know ship all he's in one sense I suppose you could say he's the most vocal in terms of his version is animosity towards Christmas up there okay but Kristen killed your son de Krishna allowed is the order to kill picture I sent you the same but in any case Christmas involved in the death
many of these demons but Paul's death was as public as you can get it was at the biggest most important event at the Super Bowl or like at like the State of the Union Address or somewhere like that but what I mean is like all the most important people wear their universally all the most important people in there and they watched Christian do that because they all have different ideas about who Christian is someone like these moves like he's like he's the great Christian he's our friend at the University with them it's it's it's sometimes it's hard to tell you know they they definitely depend on him as if he's the Lord but they loved him like a friend
 and end scene of the Demons to see him is like that
why is this guy getting all the attention right he's not even a real Warrior like the rest of the Cowherd boys and all this attention is going to hand you know that he's like dances with the girls if they were in Tennessee so anyway so they are publicly in front of everyone present a demonstrated something right that even a very powerful demon the one that was most vocal against him without any effort he would first of all he was totally unmoved by all those words just sat there be was it all to McDonald's it was the moment of his
 honor right he's being shown tremendous honor and right in that moment it's like what was that
 on your way
she went up there and started taking that award away from from Taylor Smith Taylor Swift Taylor Swift in the media that I am whatever she wants a big Waters the moment she was being honored and then he he came up there and said someone else should have gotten it is in the microphone so it's kind of like right when someone let you know you dream I'm going to be on or like they're not the Christmas tree but you know what others he was being shown the highest honor in the most important event everybody important was there to witness and then this person gets them just start hurling insults at it and what how did you respond
and then a hundred and elicited all the crimes of his annoying I guess he deserves it and then without any effort and so was it was demonstrated he's more than just arrived and at the same time something else very far out and significant was demonstrated very publicly right there right then that's what I'm going to be about now
 text me on
 Agera R r a c e l in Merrillville time and George Jetson

 text 13 formally okay with Mars you desirous performing the Rochester you sacrifice big public ritual the Great Sage Narda responding to his inquiry recited historical facts showing how the Supreme personality godhead is always impartial even in this regard so now we've gone from Sage level two
2 sage no Sage level
 if this is all true to say juggle three know you may not know cuz she was at if you join this podcast later music a bubble with a story-within-a-story within a story this is the third level within a certain level within a story we start with the sages and I made sure I knew hearing from suit to goswami it's like they're squirrels like me a squirrel with a squirrel of the squirrel you kind of is it not built like you but maybe it's a butt so we have the sages of Miami sharanya hearing from sudha goswami that's the first level within the story that suit is telling me her about sous vide goswami speak with Mars Prickett now should be they go Swami's telling on the third level we're hearing about a conversation between Narda the great the Great
amongst the Davis and you just hear you are doing his elder brother the ruler of the time and in that and again this conversation is going to carry out through all from this point on to the end of the 7th cancer from practically from the beginning to the end right here goes okay at the Rochester your sacrifice Mars you to steer Son of Mars Pond you personally saw shishupal merge into the body of the Supreme Lord Krishna Bhajan which which is witnessing that that's what I thought
 every song every so this point did this this person nobody quite knows who Christian is is he Vishnu is he had Ava is your normal Cowherd boy brick have a big reputation that he has an earned give me who is a bigger amount but everybody everybody was there and everybody saw him a realistic killed this very powerful demon she should walk and then they saw
the soul of she should probably leave his body and merge into the body of Krishna what just that that's the significant thing here
 I wish I was there I would like a genius or around here somewhere and end that's significant because what is indicating is that he achieved with the yogis come up right here cheap Liberation so you jump into the fog
did you get the same for me so you said okay and that's what it says the next verse therefore okay let's try this again okay at the Rogers you sacrifice my ride you to steer the Son of Mars Pond do Bruce Lee sausage about merge into the body of a supreme Lord Krishna therefore struck with wonder he inquired about the reason for this from the Great Sage Naruto was seated there
 while he inquired all the sages present also heard him ask the question age group meeting
 but will go start with the conversation tomorrow
