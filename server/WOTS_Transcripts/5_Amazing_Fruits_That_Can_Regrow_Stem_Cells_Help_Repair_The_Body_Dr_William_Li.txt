today we talked about amazing fruits that can help activate your own stem cells that can help you regenerate from the inside out and repair your body these fruits are black raspberries blueberries strawberries mango and proves ready let's go first I need to tell you what a stem cell is alright stem cell is a human cell you got them that actually is what that means is that it's a cell that can turn into any other kind of cell is a baby cell
 that is a capability regenerating into other tissue and we're all made of these when your dad's sperm met your mom's egg that if all of cells that was a future you were all stem cells cuz you didn't have a leg
all right and by the time were born and our bodies have been formed so this is 9 months of pregnancy we have extra stem cells that are round like mother nature is really smart we didn't run out of stem cells before we're born we had some extra overage okay some of them are in the umbilical cord basically 70 million extra stem cells in the body of the baby and the L2 regenerate our body when we actually need them to be regenerated okay critical and where do we store them we store them in our bone marrow that said she's at that the stuff that's inside the hollow of our bones are stored in our body
different organs are swelled to find themselves where they were now it's actually a stem cell therapies which is a huge undertaking not ready for prime time yet so I'm actually quite familiar with this feel now I will tell you that the stem cell therapies that you see on the corner strip out that they inject stem cells into your knee or your shoulders your joints that's actually not ready for prime time yet experienced you're still a lot more research that needs to be done but the meantime our body already has are stem cells ready to roll ready to rock and roll to be able to help us prepare for the inside out all right so the way we know we do
I got to write write our skin regenerates that's why you know we're able to shed our skin the think about it as dandruff we do our hair regenerates that's why it gets longer and you lose hair in my city often grow back hold of not always we know that I'm planning regenerate every few days so I can really regenerated not really amazing weight deliver one of the largest organ in your body is really capable from stem cells so if you were to actually lose two-thirds of your liver snip throw down that one-third that slept all right connection RI Ro the rest of the liver okay just like a salamander would regrow its leg is pretty quite amazing that they deliver connection regenerate that remarkably a long snip it off throughout the top that lung tip
so we're beginning to see course we know that nurse regenerate is well this is regenerative at 1 mmmm a day all right but the excitement around stem cells that could we harness the power regeneration to be able to help heal the heart heal the brain heals a spinal cord you know to to really do the kind of repair that would like to be able to do using Therapeutics themselves but but I'm talking about this video is how the body heals itself that's the amazing thing is that we are stem cells are part of our help body's Health defense systems I teach about all the 5 Health defense systems including stem cells and regeneration in my online course it's a disease of in quite a number of years now and what everybody always amazed by is our body has this ability to regenerate your blood vessels
what do 5% of the actual are coming from stem cells stem cells to help you repair an engine injury alright you cut yourself right get yourself over here now you need to repair basically a narrative injury will send signals into your bloodstream through out which would travel throughout your body and they are a an alert signal kind of a signal flare to your stem cells that are living inside your bone marrow and then I see there's a problem and they come flying out of your bone marrow like bees come out of a hive and they are in the bloodstream going everywhere but they know how to look for and then it says specifically home into the area that needs to be repaired and fixed just that all right but just fix the pothole there
 not touch anything else all right
go back to the storage areas all right that's the remarkable thing about stem cells think about a highway what's up somebody sent up a signal player around the pothole and then the road crews come out to replace it they're only going to fix that part of the highway going to pay anything out at once they're done patching it to go away and now you got a smooth repaired Highway that's basically how stem cells work call regeneration our body conducts regenerative healing From the Inside Out the time inside our body and that's why the regenerative system that each of my course is one of the body's critical Health defense systems okay now
I did my research is besides the fact that biotech companies are trying to stem cells by the way here's something really cool for the future scenario time I mention to you some cells live in fat they're stored in fat so this isn't actually true there are efforts to try to get those fat stem cells how do you get them get a plastic surgeon to do liposuction right so in a patient so they are actually going in there that she removed extra fat cuz that's what they do they know how to do liposuction remove the fat the fat comes out wherever they're getting it from the ballet or whatever and it comes to the canisters I got a jar and they put in a jar and it separates out all the cells they spin it around the centrifuge and the stem cells go to the bottom and they stay there before off the rest of the cells and you got stuff
total bottom and guess what they are doing the plastic surgeon hands the stem cells from fat body fat they handed to a cardiologist at the cardiologists who's working with the same patient would take those stem cells all right thing coming to a catheter and then inject a patient's own stem cells that came from the body fat into their heart into an area that they actually need to regenerate to be able to repair from heart attack or to prevent a heart attack or a plastic surgeon in the cardiologist with get together in order to collaborate on regenerative medicine but this is the kind of effort that she going on I can tell you that there's also think I work at is very impressive showing that themselves again from body fat
 can be injected into spinal cord that's been severed okay so you can do this in quadruple
and I just been at least one case where there were to get somebody who could not move any their arms or legs so they were truly totally paralyzed they were actually able to get them to move their arms legs again and ask you what this isn't even be able to walk so the proper proof of concepts are not yet ready for prime time to be applied everybody from a medical perspective amazing to me is at the body does a spy itself and that there are foods that can be used as medicine to cure stem cells to come out and do more than what they would normally do so another Wise Foods as medicine can actually activate your body's regenerative stem cell Health defense system to be able to heal you more from the inside out looks like about the black raspberries if you haven't heard
black raspberry basically it's a regular except that it's a dark color to Spectrum Rite Aid and a dark color is due to the huge amount of anthocyanins at the bioactive it's a natural dye in dye to make snipers black all right and blueberries blue makes the rest for a really dark it's got a lunch gas and Elijah tannins anthocyanins and black raspberries and researchers in Korea I bet you in studying the effects of eating black raspberries and people who have metabolic syndrome right so let me just tell you what my metabolic syndrome is this is a Chia Pet of a situation where you have all the makings that could lead you towards diabetes eventually high blood pressure high blood sugar high blood cholesterol and a larger waist size right and the waist size gets bigger because the inside the tube of your body is fat that can actually grow when when you're growing a lot of extra body fat visceral fat
the tube out from the inside out and that's why you got up your you're going to let out an extra because your waist has expanded all right so this is actually happened and what these researchers did is they drew blood from their subjects at the beginning of the study and then they gave everyone black raspberry powder to dried red black raspberries ground out every single day to consume for 12 weeks all right and another group was given a placebo and don'ts after 12 weeks show that those people who are eating the black raspberry powder had a 30% increase in the number of stem cells they had their blood meaning
 eating the black raspberries recruited more stem cells into their bloodstream and he's blood of these stem cells actually go on to repair
organ repair tissue that might be in need of repair in metabolic syndrome all right that's really amazing son has no blood B 13% now what about the people getting the placebo like no black raspberries turns out that those people had a 35% decrease in the number of stem cells in their bloodstream completely the other directions and 30% increase between the impact of eating black raspberries and basically metabolic syndrome damages and so just shows you that you can actually augment the number of stem cells in your bloodstream to do what they do best which is actually helps to repair you from the inside out now the other thing that
I found is that people had better resiliency that they have the ability to be resilient meaning that when you need more Flowmaster flow no problem they have the capacity to handle it this is actually a function of stem cells because vessels let us get hard unless we get older so it turns out that heating black raspberries kept the Situation's different situations either they're required to all right so pretty cool black dress purse that's the first second or blueberries does it mention of answers the same time black raspberries and researchers at Cornell University look at whether eating blueberries would have an effect on stem cells in your muscle that's really important
muscles need to be built and so what these women who are aged 21 to 40 all right and they gave the 30 G of freeze dried blueberries what's 30 G of three priests tried blueberries that's about a third of a cup okay so think about the measuring cup of your kitchen third of a cup is nothing it's like anybody need that that's what these women 8 every day for six weeks all right and the researchers collected their blood during the six weeks I so before they got anything at Time Zero at a month in at the end to more we said we 6th to see what's going on with the stem cells and replied with blueberry eating and what are they find they for the researchers found that eating blueberries just a third of a cup a day for six weeks could improve the muscle stem cell numbers by 40% wow 40 per cent increase lighting I just a third of a cup of blueberries
in these stem cells were much more resilient to stress in the body which is a good thing now the reason to rush you looking at least 21 and 41 the research to look at the same effect in older women 6279 okay he did not find that the blueberries could do the same thing so they're younger population of a stem cells but for people and women did not actually have that same benefit the muscle stem cell which was increased by blueberries is super important because it can I show you can to help contribute to muscle regeneration in young women all right so when you stoop clinical studies like this and you show that they work all right and you can measure the increase in stem cells prompted by the food in in
doing and what the benefits are at the molecular and cellular McCain and can get a benefit out of it serve food strawberries I want a very thin, take care of right now we got your black friends for you to get your blueberries and strawberries strawberries one of my favorite foods of the exams are places that grow strawberries like in Europe if you go to a certain cities in Europe and you can smell strawberries are selling at the market from a block away they were so ripe in fragrance okay and strawberries have a bioactive Cody lactic acid any lactic acid can help to restore neural stem cells and a connection for Motorola regeneration Nero meaning of nerves so nerves themselves for nerve regeneration amazing okay
his research has been done by scientists from Windsor University in Beijing and Shanghai University of engineering Sciences they were looking at all the thing something strawberry could stimulate stem cells to protect the brain after brain injury in lab studies okay so brain injury stay in the lab you may use a large cats and found strawberries that would work I'm telling you when you actually go to the lab you can get down to the nitty-gritty details ellagic acid which is found in Stars strawberries work by stimulating nerve stem cells neural stem cells to help to regenerate the brain alright they'll do you want to get more electric acid from the strawberry and courage you to buy organic because it's been shown that organic strawberries will have more
is produced by the strawberry to heal itself and inorganic growing conditions it's got all the little bugs nibbling on the leaves in the stem sewed where you sprayed with pesticides there's less stress on the plant not as much natural nibbling so it doesn't need to make as much gas has all right so so many things good things you could do with strawberries I like they eat strawberries alone if you want to actually make a really nice flavor combination with strawberry try taking some fresh mint placing it up and serving with the strawberries those to flavor combinations are amazing all right and then another way that I think could really light up a strawberry to get USM extra help these to add aged balsamic vinegar to it alright vinegar contains acetic acid acetic acid metabolism from getting bigger
um and strawberries are going to lunch gas and also good for metabolism and studies eventually shown in people who are eating strawberries you're going to shrink the waste that diameter as well one of these Great Fairy so that you can help stimulate neural stem cells regenerate right I was like can you imagine like one day you going to choose figure out how to turn that into a treatment but straw just eating strawberries that she can contribute that the lactic acid into your body which is a good thing all right mango all right I lost mangos I love a really sweet Mango Mangos are great source of dietary fiber and they have a bioactive called mangiferin all right now to help stem cells protect themselves
go to help them do all they can do and what do stomach cells get injured or or assaulted we need to protect them turns out that if you have too much sugar in a bloodstream now immediately mangoes are pretty sweet but if you have hyperglycemia so this is people with diabetes or pre-diabetes super high sugar high blood content that she's Stones themselves super high salt content stems Sun stem cells protect against that in your stem cells or stunts themselves cigarette smoke primary cigarette smoke secondary smoke that she will stun your some salt and drinking alcohol is really really bad and so is super high blood lipids are cholesterol in your bloodstream that also your sons are some cells look I talked about a lot of situation
protects your stem cells it's kind of like a little shield around the stem cells because all these are forces might be weakened though
 Dimension mango also am has good source of dietary fiber dietary fiber good for gut health the gut microbiome 39 killing bacteria a lot of your gut lower part of the got the colon and then goes by by having dietary fiber or feeding our healthy gut bacteria to we feed her healthy gut bacteria naturally release substances called short chain fatty acids that lower inflammation they boost our immune system they help us heal all right as well and this is the research I've done it all Mighty looking at you know the impact of gut bacteria and got help in a probiotics actually
trumped the gut microbiota to be able to do the right thing is quite amazing let's see what I can tell you about that I like to do as well of course I looked at you slice a mango okay and you can even cook with Green Mango take a look at some Thai Dishes for with Green Mango but can make a smoothie to make a shake out of a mango you don't know what I would tell you and that's a lot of the big sugar low so I recommend that you actually eat sliced right through make sure it's ripe you'll kill would give them a little bit I'm that's actually the the the best way to actually have it check this out
 from what's in my mom to
look for when I buy the Staples at the grocery store it's all right here all you have to do is click on the link and enjoy and if you do cookies contain vitamin K2 that's a bioactive been shown to cut off the blood supply to tumors okay I also lower the overall incidence of cardiovascular disease as well but you can actually cook chicken thighs for example and with some veggies but you can actually add sliced mango to it as well that's kind of a Thai Dish all right going to look into it further for a recipe just go to Google take mango and Chicken in Thai recipe is search click on the video you'll find somebody showing you exactly how to do it and then they'll give you the recipe as well so I love manga
it's really delicious tropical fruit bearing in it all right you probably have seen a prune in a can in the middle section of the grocery store stone fruit in the summer time you'll see plums everywhere in the Farmers Market really delicate skin light a sweet flesh in a pit in the middle all right now when you dry all that up to take the pit out you dried-up shriveled-up you and eventually having a prune now cruise actually I was thinking about prunes is being used at the laxative meaning that I can help you dress cups constipation by helping your bowel move so you can be more regular me and probably works that way.
dietary fiber in a cruise from a health perspective also and stem cells have chloroplast in a kased chlorogenic acid acid improves stem cells all right and you're going to rebuild and got all the time or just chlorogenic acid in there that she helps your stomach cells regenerate the lining of your gut that's pretty important because you're the gut health and you don't like when people talk about leaky gut you know an inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel we think that some of them and you want your some cells to be able to repair any of that leak okay so chlorogenic acid which is found in prunes can actually do that another prunes that the skin of Thrones right which is a shriveled-up plum also contains are so like acid or silica acid also helps to regen
are tissues by stimulating are stem cells specifically the vascular system cells so it's different for the gut lining it's also good to build and rebuild and repair our circulation it regenerates our circulation and this has been shown in lab studies with her so like acid where blood vessels are blocked the animals are just like you'd find in a dried prune all right and it turns out that then you'll actually regenerate the circulation again even though the blood vessel is blocked pretty amazing and of course these fruits have a lot of dietary fiber the dietary fiber feeds and got my crib right and feeding the gut microbiome the fiber makes the gut microbiome a healthy and happy and they pay us back when they're well-fed okay just like a pet dog you going to feed your dog
because you're back with love or a microbiome shows us its Love by producing short chain fatty acids into and in her bloodstream which lowers inflammation alright the lower your risk I'd sort of the one of the root causes of chronic diseases his information or information associated with somebody's chronic diseases and you had she lowers I'm down by having feed him dietary fiber which is found in prunes so in addition to all the benefits of chlorogenic acid and the folic acid that's in there now you're also be able to get better gut health and lower inflammation as well so that's really all went as medicine is Amy for the regenerative food as medicine it's something that we can have to do with these fruit so monstrous recap a little bit we talked about as some of my favorite fruits black raspberry okay we talked about
we talked about strawberries we talked about mangoes we talked about prunes and there's a lot of other fruits by the way then actually beneficial impact on your is it was and I just wanted to call out because they're easy to find you can find them in the middle aisle of a grocery store as well as the produce section and dried fruits are also. All right terms of buying these types of fruits is that you can get them seasonally from a farmers market during their PCS in your also you always going to get the best quality the highest polyphenols in there to get organic that's preferable and the reason is preferable is that it's really hard to wash off pesticides on the skin of a strawberry and plus I have more of a polyphenol more Clark you know who would want to have that so that's a good thing about
buying all these fruits that you can find prunes are dried plums all year long in the middle aisle at the grocery store that somebody to help you find them all right by the way it sits like a package food so please we're getting prunes pick up a container and look at the ingredient label and make sure there isn't anything they added make sure didn't make out of sugar make sure they didn't add the other chemicals that you don't want to be putting introduced me into your body all right so but you can find any time before these other fruits get them seasonally and locally that's the ideal get him organic that's why I deal what can you do you can I get some Frozen
 frozen fruit when it comes to polyphenols have got all those goodness all that polyphenols locked right in because when
who is picked to be frozen it's picked off a pick up in the field by Growers and it's flash frozen right away free past it, if it's being flown from the other side of the country which is by the way what I'm telling you go for a local farmers market not come from very far away it's right off the tree then it's at the farmers market that's really good Frozen is just fine frozen fruit is a pretty great you want to ask you make a smoothie or something out of it that actually is a great way to be able to get these have proof before there's blueberries or strawberries or mango he's a really really common I highly recommend checking them out and look up recipes with frozen or fresh berries and mix them together right you can actually make a bowl for breakfast or a bowl for dessert you know many the Mediterranean and ancient
she'll just give you some fruit for dessert especially in Asia and that actually the topping off your meal with something can activate your stem cells to regenerate From the Inside Out actually I'm winning at Choice when it comes to having fruits that are actually good for your help all right until the Bruce and thanks for watching I will catch you on the next video
 honey are you enjoyed watching this video I know you'll love the next one and check it out and I'll see you there
