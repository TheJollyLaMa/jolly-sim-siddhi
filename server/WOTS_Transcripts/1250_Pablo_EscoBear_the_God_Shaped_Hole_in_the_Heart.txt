 But you know what I'm always ask like a good introduction book and you know what I want unless you're deeply philosophical it's very difficult to get people a good introduction balls in my life I don't think I could have made it through a book at 22 years old but it was it was the devotees telling me their stories that's what convinced me to get into
 the books but I really think I'm a Swami's book is a very good intro book what you're saying about your own book introduction and I am listening to my book on audio audible right now
and I realize it it's a good introduction where it doesn't sound like I'm a mouthpiece for the Harry Krishna movement either it just sort of like my personal journey and then go get one from here and a mare might also have announcements besides buying two of your books by the board my books
 also went back to recover your meetings at 1 to 9 p.m. eastern time and if you live in Alachua there's a woman's meeting live laugh and watch for tomorrow evening and a men's meeting on Wednesday evening live in Elektra
 exciting I got a crazy nugget for you today right now
 oh great you ready keep it real cuz there's a lot to talk
with this. It's important may sound crazy but I just came across this thing and it talked about this movie that came out about a year ago so what I'm reading to you is stuff that I kind of just a classic movie classic a classic
 but it came out about a year ago I kind of just took an article I forget where I was from I kind of piece it together so I'm going to be reading from a chopped up article okay but it's about a film that came out about a year ago and it's called cocaine bear
 ready for this sounds like a class right up there with a War and Peace on the winds in a cocaine bear is a dark comedy that premieres Friday so this is about a year ago in theaters Nationwide it's a highly fix
Eliza count in which the titular 500-pound American black bear eats a duffel bag of cocaine and goes on a killing Rampage in Georgia forcing tours to band together to survive an apex predator hopped up on coke been there done that the movie has been met with much anticipation for moviegoers after the trailer went viral last year racking up more than 16 million views on YouTube
 oh okay it was a truce to cook a how much more detail could it go into there's a lot more to this is a plot there's a hero's journey with This Bear That was not the bear so much but now you're going to hear about the background and I think their lessons we can take from this post from cocaine
that you pick this today we can learn lessons from cocaine bear and
 others that that will be revealed as if we go through this December 1985
 AR3 sentence item appeared in the New York Times reported that an American black bear and Georgia had overdosed on cocaine
 Kenneth Alonzo the state's chief medical examiner told reporters that the bear was found in a very badly decomposed State at the Chattahoochee Shawnee National Forest surrounded by bags that authorities estimated held about 75 lb of cocaine well I think the bear ate 75 lb of cocaine a the bear had gotten a hold of one of the death of a duffel bag full of coke three months later the authority to authorities discovered 175 lb
Jared died of what the corner described as a stomach quote literally packed to the brim with cocaine the animal was given a new name and popular culture cocaine bear
 or write what you got to do that for second not know what cocaine is
 that's good for her if don't mess with their Corona let's take drugs that's all we have to say is getting a new name and popular culture cocaine bear or Pablo Escobar
 are you kidding did you just make that up there was nothing left but bones in a big hide said Gary Garner from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation destroy the physical body or they found a rotted bear they found a ride a bear but they probably cut
stomach a pound all do cocaine packed in there which is very sad
 okay but but the bear which was about 3 or 4 years old probably died within 30 to 45 minutes from acute cocaine intoxication noting that the animal had suffered cerebral hemorrhaging respiratory failure hypothermia renal failure heart failure and strokes beer
 I'm going to shows you what can cocaine can do to you you know use your it just took it and took it took more and more it didn't take it and was satisfied if that bear booking to the bear state of mind but that tells us that a bear will eat cocaine just till it drops right but how did the cocaine get there in the first place right how did this picture come across this story okay so this story leads us to Andrew see Thornton the second whose life was once filled with privilege and promise
 a Kentucky blue blood
raised on a thoroughbred horse farm in Bourbon County Kentucky he dropped out of college after one semester to join the Army where he became a paratrooper for the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg North Carolina after his military service he became sin or he became a Narcotics officer
 and later found his calling as a leader of a local drug smuggling ring okay if you became a leader of a drug-smuggling ring yes so he went from the Army he was a wealthy well-to-do guy that became a trooper then became a narc then became then he decided no let me I could whatever we don't know how it happened right but good for these drug dealers so he somehow got the idea I'll be happier in life
 if I become a drug Smuggler what Mayo make that choice he he was he was already
policeman
 okay on September 11th 1985 Thornton in the middle of his most ambitious drug run yet was forced to dump over 200 lb of cocaine by Parachute Over Georgia after realizing the load is too heavy for the aircraft so you couldn't picture this guy you know in a Colombian airport or a Colombian airstrip or whatever not playing with his much cocaine is he can stuff it with right right they can't hold that much weight those planes so so he's flying over Georgia now he's realizing we can't handle this so he throws 200 lb / that's the cocaine that was found by the building. So now he's but now he's thrown you can he throw a 200 lb of cocaine overboard
he's got a plane still packed with cocaine and now he's jumping out of the plane and it with a parachute then he put on a pair of shooting a jump so I guess he was trying to retrieve the cocaine that he threw overboard retrieve it later he's going to jump out of the plane he's jumping out of the plane going to be in the woods with a bunch of cocaine anyway bunch of bad choices well you know that the problem is that the parachute he put on his parachute and jump with the parachute never opened
 you know what do the free fall from I've been watching worst parachute fails for this is one of them seems like it should be a pair of his parachute never open the free-fall from thousands of feet send crashing into a backyard instantly killing the 40 year-old who was wearing a bulletproof vest night vision goggles and Gucci loafers
 Thornton was found with a broken neck
$4,500 in cash Two Pistols two knives ropes and more than 70 lb of cocaine according to the police so he's got 70 lb of cocaine is jumping Jang he's got 200 lb of cocaine on the ground he was he look at this guy he's intelligent a successful and he's as ignorant as the bear when it comes like the bear was just eating cocaine moreland's he's just you know what I'm saying yes how much cocaine does he need to sell to be happy he must have had hundreds and hundreds of pounds in the plane if you through 200 off sure
 any jumps off with another 70
 I mean what is you need to be happy you know bridled exactly
now what that made me think of organized especially with the beer but not just with the bear with the human was these you know they do these experiments on rats with cocaine
 you know what I do with the rats didn't they give him two bottles of water one one regular and one with cocaine in it. Okay so I'm going to reach you about American psychologist Dr Bruce Alexander who conducted some experiments in the 1970s that have to be called the the rat Park I liked your principal Circle right now we are at some crazy Sensational we're going to take this to the holy yoga scriptures we're going to run and get them but I still hope that bridge my friend in a cage all alone
this is important all alone with no other community brats and offered two bottles of water one filled with with water and the other with heroin or cocaine the rats would repetitively drink from the drug lace bottles until they all overdosed and died like pigeons pressing a pleasure lever lever they were Relentless until their bodies and brains were overcome and they died that's what happens when you take a rat leave it alone in a room and you give it two bottles one with cocaine in one plain okay interesting is is is dumb Thornton any different than this rat or the bear like he just killed himself just chasing after happiness in the form of selling cocaine right now but but here's an interesting thing Alexander there was a researcher he wondered is this about the drug
 or might it be related to the setting at the rat
the test is hypothesis he put rats in the hood rat parks where they were among others and free to roam and play and socialize with other rats
 and they were given the same access to the same two types of drug lace bottles
 when it happening or at Park they were Market we preferred the plain water even when they did in vibes from the drug fill bottles they did so intermittently not obsessively never overdosed
 do you think I'm an animal scientist and some people call me that but I can't get I can't figure out this hypothesis I think what it says is the loneliness of drawers and the drugs yeah there was like a I think cocaine bear had a god-shaped hole in his heart and that's why he was eating all that cocaine I think these rats when they're all alone
they go for that cocaine until they die and I think our friend Thornton what was his name again and you see Thornton second I think he also had that hole in the heart that he was trying to fill and he was running as blindly as the rat you know as ignorantly as our friend the cocaine bear even though he was a sophisticated well-educated well-to-do human being how much are how much are we like that how much do we consume television we just sit there like I'll sit in front of Netflix and just take it you know maybe we don't watch Netflix till we die but we do with the hell yeah yeah exactly you couldn't be me and you watch shows when we were little you want to watch Welcome Back Kotter you get one for 25 minutes 20 minutes with commercials You chords
television do you could have been
 you could watch you know like yeah I guess I did I miss those days waiting after the dentist school and you just sitting on the couch watching television all the boring soap operas and push through till noon to 1
 yeah but just picture that Andrew see Thornton this the second and you know he's got he's got a Plane full of millions and millions of dollars worth of cocaine tons of it any stuff that he wasn't even you know he couldn't even think clearly like well I shouldn't put too much on the plane or the plane won't fly smoothly now he's singing stuff to play with as much as possible and then the plane is obviously having some trouble now he's like throwing some off the plane and you know you still got a plane packed full of cocaine he's think I'm losing out you know I got to go and get that cocaine down on the ground otherwise I've lost something in
you know we talked with Tom verse the Bible verse for one who senses are out of control and write this reminds me of that for one whose 4141 who is the way the verse go is all there is within the three worlds although there is within the universe to satisfy the senses cannot satisfy the senses of one whose senses are uncontrolled sure everything he wants right already yeah yeah but he couldn't just say what do I need how much money do I need to be relatively comfortable then let me search for deeper happiness in life
 he's got things I need to stack up the money like crazy I was thinking of these verses reggaeton from the East she'll punish shut everything animal or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled by the East Fire by the Lord one should therefore except
only those things necessary for himself which are set aside as is quota and one should not accept other things going well to whom they belong one may aspire to live for hundreds of years to be continuously goes I'm working in that way for that sort of work will not bind him to the law of karma there's no alternative to this way from man that's your punishment much is 1 + 2
 this type of thinking right you know like it is you know a lot of these some films that may be cocaine bear with different type of film you know but there are a lot of sounds like a lot of the crime related films have to do with people who date do you know it's usually has like they're coming up in the world is the criminal and then they have to break through and finally there are plots are working and everything is exciting and fun and is dynamic what degree takes over they don't they don't pull out you know they don't think they want more and more and more when we do
Mr Christina is it's very easy for us to sit here and say you know that I was too greedy and consumed him you know just what was just like you
 it's like if you look at Tiger Woods or like what's the matter with this guy is such a he's a sex addict we don't have to type of gorgeous that hundreds of gorgeous women on our doors like tiger would probably does my point is here we don't have the type of money coming at us that would we feel that you and me both feel like you have work we're over greed big deal is greed maybe we're going to be tempted by it one bit like that guy was tempted like Millie and then burst out of the heart you don't maybe we just maybe maybe we're not as over it as we think maybe we're just not good at making money
you know what I'm saying well yeah but I'm not even trying to pursue that I'm not even interested in in the pursuer pursue a lot of it you know I know all I'm saying is if Karma came your way we're just dumped Millions on your lap you think I would want to go out and get more well I'm not saying you would but I'm saying that might
 okay well fair enough but in any case we can learn from it can we not we can definitely learn from it but would you want to share this because you know what I was in a band you know it being a bad you're always broke if you got a paper guitar strings and drum heads and drumsticks most bands never make money you pay to play in a band but as soon as we got sign that we got a record deal
you're like 20 years old in the rest of the we never made money and we did make tons of money for this record deal but at the time it was twenty-five thousand bucks now you don't understand in a band you make no money we've never had any money where to get just a bunch of kids playing music but $25,000 could it could have been 25 million dollars as far as we are concerned immediately when we are all like wait a second I wrote that song I wrote this song now you're going to react until you have it
 so I'm giving this guy whatever his name is Gordon Horton Hears a Who Knew whatever his name is
 I get to be I understand where you're coming from you're getting possessed by the greed and wealth we could be there in a moment are worse could come out of us in a moment
but there was something to what that researcher Rob Bruce Alexander found in his rat Park experiments that's the idea that our friends you think if we have better with it you know that kind of goes back to some of the questions we took I think yesterday before I forget where we were talking about you know how certain stability certain mental stability is conducive you do for the practice a bucket for peaceful mind you know it seems that when those when those rats were all alone they were they had a big
 big hole in the heart you know that just had them taken that cocaine water like crazy words when they were when they had him or kind of like favorable social circumstance they were so prone to self-destruction
 and dumb and in that becomes you know part of
I'm sitting here in a limited Taurus you know apartment while I'm here my point and I see he's just a person that his say Ava is so much sat around serving the devotees you know like I consider people come to the door all day with different needs and you're looking for help in different ways cuz they just know he's a person that helps people and he helps them and it gave me a great gift to give me the length of the cheat on your bag of Utz which I really really want it and you let me borrow them to me cuz he said he thinks in that way let me serve the divorce I me please the hearts of devotees to get their blessings but I think there's something there that has Bucky Yogi's if we can create the atmosphere where people feel Joy and satisfaction and comfort and love within a community
 then what we have such an easier time not be coming
end of our lower nature so we kind of owe it to one another to look out for another not just look out for another but kind of like um
 kind of like, fill the hearts of one another with with some genuine love you know
 we know they're in the 12-step program they say you know the addiction is secondary there's like there is a hole in the heart we're putting anything in specific you have a proclivity towards alcohol or drugs or sex or shopping or eating whatever it is there never will be enough if that if not some God connection or maybe in this case Mouse connection with your other mice are there connection ostracised from the bear community and he's just going to do what I need right now is the house duffle bag
became known as Pablo Escobar
 bears are solitary creatures
 okay State Fair
 it's very interesting story and you can have a great okay they're very well so it's been alleged that the bear is kept in Lexington Kentucky mall at according to the Bears on some people say this isn't the same bear but their owners are saying that it is according to the Bears owner the cocaine bear has authority to officiate legally-binding weddings in the mall where it's kept the loophole
Kentucky's marriage laws
 there's another rumor that that bear was owned by that the Bears what do they call it is it called when you stop the bear when your stuff together at the store made taxidermies at the Taxidermy bear was owned by Waylon Jennings but Waylon Jennings son says that that's not true
 this is
 I can message skaven on my iWatch I guess it was from Jennifer bear a bear
Zoom I want to she's related to Pablo Escobar
 okay okay of us can do this question because it's got a backhoe no one to nine ratio the super most human being until mother saraswathy the goddess of learning and you should have gas today of the author messed up her usual botheration H&R Block nearby with a nice sticky my regular tennis classes in the bottom of Tom and by rendering service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to Hart become erratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised the transcendental songs we established as in a revocable fact
how's my sweetie go to bed
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch and a balance payoff Rabe since he's at their Lotus feet is healthy for bear
 you're jealous and have Perry now cuz I had a hand in the garage are you okay what are we doing where are we chapter 3 texts
text 6 okay so now we're what we read about we're going to tell you what we're reading.
 We're reading about who run Akashi Pewds the demoniac mentality how he is performing intense austerity
 and he's like the bear rug in. He's his in other words or he's like Thornton evil he just eats bears eat things
 yeah but he could have been said he could have gotten a little cocaine buzz and been satisfied with you said no more more more and and open your tent in like to find a pack of gum in your back pocket they just are not like okay fine not the bear Thornton okay he could have been satisfied her any cash you could have just asked to hit a lot of items a lot of power
so he's doing intense austerities to get power
 to get well he wants your friends Warden the the guy parachuted out yeah this is not the bear I switch it over to I'm not I'm not talk. Talking about Pablo Escobar anymore so it's so he's performing his intense austerity so that he could become what he really wants me to come right now with his Immortal he wants the position of Irma and he thinks the permission to position vermaas immortality she wants to take over that role and he's going to do in tents or stairs for the Vermont will come and give it to him
 and so that's where we're at
 is text sex now scourged and extremely disturbed because of the scourge
an extremely disturbed because of her and you got your flu severe Penance has all the demigods left the planets where they reside and went to the planet where they inform the Creator as follows lord of the demigods o Master of the Universe because of the fire emanating from her mind because she poops head as a result of his severe austerity is we have become so Disturbed that we could not stay in our planets but I've come to you this is important if we understand that Universal layout
 is like you do you go up to interest planets and that's all like the different Dave is right the different gods and they all got power Prestige always everything Vermont he's at the very top of the universe that highest planetary system he's kind of Beyond it he's he's more the sage
 then the demigods he's more the wise one right always the voice of reason he's not a he she
showing any fear of a hernia cause she Pooh's accumulating power but but today was are worried about their position and where this is going to lead us, like okay you're coming to me for some help let's see what we can do
 are any caterpillars with undertaken text seven of the universe if you think it proper kindly stop these disturbances meant to destroy everything before all your OB and subjects are not dilated
 have you ever had a circumstance where I can. Where you going to wise person because you're worried about some development and the wise person is kind of like a butt butt the butt than the wise persons kind of like they don't see it as much of a problem as you see they're kind of like more detached have you ever had that I know I've had that thing sometimes shock
like why are you worried about this problem here I'm about to cry and you're smiling had that happen I don't like it but I get it was undertaken a most severe type of austerity although his plan is not unknown to you kindly listen as we submit his intentions
 I know you know this but I got to tell you anyway the Supreme person within the universe Lord their mama has gotten his exalted post by dint of severe austerity is Mystic power and tramps consequently after creating the university has become the most worship of all that me God within it since I'm Eternal in X eternal I shall Endeavor for such austerity Mystic power and transfer many many births unless I shall occupy the same post occupied
my Lord, you know what's interesting here so from her viewpoint he sees her mama got his position by dint of austerities Mystic power and trance now it's a fact if we go to the back to the second Canto of Bob with time we do see that he got this message right topic for more stories we saw that he went into Mystic trance
 but what was also spoke about there was that a person is there was a person that gave him that instruction that was Lord Vishnu there was a person that needle that entered the heart of Vermont and gave him his knowledge and his power and that was Vishnu so is all that power it wasn't the austerities that generated the power the power was given by Vishnu
but but doesn't see any of that he thinks it's like no you do it by your stairs as you get that power and I'm just like 4 modded it I can do it sure you work hard you get that power they take Vishnu out of the picture that's the demoniac mentality
 okay I Love You by dint of my severe austerity is I shall reverse the results of Pious and Empires activities I shall overturn all the established practices within this world even Drew veloca will be vanquished at the end of the Millennium there for what is the use of it I shall prefer to remain in this position so the ideas at the very top of the University of Vermont playing even when the whole universe goes to this
 destruction
 Vermont Place remains untouched he thinking I can get over there to even when everything falls
part I'm still protected and dumb and listen to this I shall reverse the results of pies and pies activities I'm going to flip the whole script I'm going to be able to play with the laws once I'm in that role so that like another words generosity and recognition of
 of the gods are ultimately Vishnu will no longer bring auspiciousness what will bring us fishing since is when everything's always around me
 one man sex only pathetic animals trying to conquer death yeah
 working out and plastic surgery and dying my hair every man dies their hair than everybody
 nothing
 I wouldn't
are you off or just a dime I just thought you were talking about the other thing
 text Coop by dint of my austerity so we have heard from reliable sources that in order to obtain your post got you poo is now engaged in severe austerity you are the master of the three worlds please without delay take whatever steps you deem appropriate do something or do something or
 you're sort of like you get
 you go to the police hey I put about a restraining order on this guy I told them in the guy still this guy still going to cause trouble over your position within this universe is certainly a most auspicious for everyone especially the cows in the brahmins grammatical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly glorified
that's all kinds of material happiness opulence and good fortune will automatically increase but unfortunately
 if Ronnie statue occupies your seat rate they will be lost
 okay true
 okay bing.cin form of the demigods the most powerful or Vermont accompanied by Borrego daksha another great sages immediately started for the place where has she was performing his penances and austerities
 who is Karen has seen its going on where he's doing his austerity is just like a big ant hill is like his entire he was standing on his toes with his arm stretched in the air we haven't seen in Hills like this is a huge animal of India Hill
image giant ant hills because of his entire body is in the anthill and even his flesh has been eaten by the ants there's nothing there but bones inside the ant hill
 and look for out my key wouldn't but Mickey did austerities to
 yeah I think I'm leaking mean something like consumed by the Anvil or something
 looks like you know that
 what is valmiki mean
 never mind who is carried by a Merrick Wick Swan at first could not see where heretic ashepoo was for her any cash you whose body was covered by an anthill and my grass
 and bamboo sticks because Ronnie cuz you Pooh had been there for a long time the and said the bad word his skin fat
blood
 what a scene and then Lord For Mama and the demigod spotted him resembling a cloud-covered son
 heating all the worlds by his austerity struck with Wonder lorber My begin to smile and then addressed him as follows who's Crazy determined right like when we look at Thornton
 is kind of like that ride like the kind of determination takes to get an airplane go to go to Columbia packed the airplane full of cocaine you do with a bunch of drug smugglers in in Columbia that's not an easy thing to wash your fly and then you're you're saying you know what I'm putting on a
parachute I'm grabbing a 70 lb of cocaine and I'm jump it's just like how determined if only that determination with directed in another way so I suppose performing incredibly intense austerity incredibly tense of yogic focus but it's all centered around selfishness
 and it and it leads to destruction or in business or in things that we focus but they're divorced from your relationship with God they're back they might be in complete opposite you might be a be a bodybuilder just for validation Sesame was a man look at that 15 16 pack you got and you're so yeah steriti what's it called
chapter 17 that's austerity promote of passion or ignorance you were reading because you had been there for a long time they answered about his skin fat Flesh and Blood please continue with that person covered Sun heating all the worlds with us 30 struck with Wonder Lord began to smile and then addressed must follow so he's gross right now he's done so much austerities he looks like he's dead he looks like a skeleton but he's not and look for my he smiles
 I'm not sure why but he's I think he's impressed and the same time
 maybe he's like look he thinks he's going to find his happiness this way you know look how hard he's working for it like we could week if we were watching the I suppose
we saw the bear and tons of cocaine but like if we're watching a film about Thornton we might be saying look at him look at him it is like he thinks he's got a plan that's going to work he's working really hard for it and it's not going to bring him the happiness he thinks and it's not just fall and thousands of feet from an airplane and dies with a semi bag of 70 lb bag of cocaine I mean I know this prepared right this
 when do spiders get high on his own Supply you know what they say about that don't do it now don't get high and there's a property rights here he says the living entity can live merely by his own power without the help of skin marrow bone blood and so on because it said and this is from I think this from the brihadaranyaka upanishad Ganga
yeah a single crochet the living Anthony has nothing to do with the material covering
 we have nothing we think that our life is dependent on the body but it's not interesting we think our life is a pain in the butt but we are we are life that's what we are we are you know we are made of living energy that's our nature and that living energy becomes associated with end
 enliven to body
 right and so we think oh we're only live is on his body is like no other body comes alive in connection with its also a yogi like her cause she poo even though we didn't have any flesh left he was keeping his he was he was he was remaining in that skeleton
 I'm through this to Party Source
Renny koshy poof performed
 a severe type of the Pasha austerity for many long years indeed it is said that he performed at the Pasha for 100 Heavenly years since then so that's a very long time by Nature's Own Way his body had been almost consumed by earthworms and some other parasites and therefore even from I was at first unable to see him later however Broomall could ascertain where he running high school was a mob was struck with Wonder to see her run your car supposed extraordinary power to execute the dead because his body was covered in so many ways but love her mother Supreme living being in this universe could understand that hernia cause she was alive but covered by material elements
 and I got a deal
 I hope no one uses your drug advice as to take away what was it don't don't get high on Supply
take away the day and we'll get high and your way back yet even the drug dealers the successful ones could recognize you know if you start getting high on your own Supply finished
 thank you cuz you keep that in mind okay
 thank you for this show today cuz she was supposed to come with us we'd read about overdosing animals overdosing problems with greed and other the lesson is it has to do with you except what it's been set aside for your quota you learn to be happy with that in life right and then have Community with other and that's important to a 12-step program
I don't need to drink that water to make sure that the other mice don't have a little god-shaped hole in the heart and how much protein do you need to sell to be happy how much cocaine do you need to sell to be happy that's one question they try to come back tomorrow with an answer for that question
 how much cocaine does a mouse need to sell 3/2
 unbridled greed can make you lose your intelligence that's for sure except your own quota
 that's that's a sharp on a shared wisdom right there no stash your hash
pretty got bad right now
 there'll never be enough if you don't have sole connections
