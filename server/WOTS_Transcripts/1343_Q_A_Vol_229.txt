 was great to see you again my eyes you're a big part of our family be part of our show and we look up to you and I love having you in our life
 wonderful homecoming when we came down there
Ellie we already hurt in the back the tiger of the cat and the Roaring came as we drove closer we saw you aren't we done got yes everyone that I'm very happy to be with all of you because it is sunga that is any association with spiritually minded people has always been result we we move forward we get hints of in that Association of what could be the next 11 for us and how we could obtain it so I hope it's a dynamic Sanger today with many inspiring insights for all of us
looking forward to start next year I thought I could ask you and I do not about your book from the monkey and a few of the chapters and was very impressed by let us say that the Lively connected to real-life presentation I think behind every spurtle that is also a human story that is how does the one who is on the pot apply the teaching struggle with the teachings hopefully digest them at the end and so on it I found a lot of
it's a connection of the spiritual ideas to a human being who is trying to. His path through the jungle uncertainties of what was in your mind when you wrote the book
 I really want to talk about more I should book but
 is he's also a very prolific author he's a international teacher has students all over the world and is a very deep spiritual estate a month for the last 40-plus years as far as my book cuz I didn't really want to write it but the publisher and I wanted to write like a self-help book teaching spiritual philosophy made simple but they encouraged me to write my story and it was a little difficult if you knew me during the time I was
ridden like sort of in Patchwork because I'm going to tell a little stories but it's hard for me to create an entire Arc of my life and I'm I'm I'm very distracted and I do a lot of things on a regular basis was hard to find writing time so it took about four years to put together and basically I basically threw out a different little stories together that have short of a beginning a middle and an end and I like to look back at my life as little stories that have a beginning middle and end and a lesson and it's in those lessons that I feel like I can sort of grow and I think as you were saying like whenever you were in a spiritual book about someone is Journey and how they digest spiritual information and assimilated
 I don't expect anybody to live my life or even take the make the same choices I did but generally as different as we are we're all very similar in a lot of ways as well we all
go through love heartbreak gain loss you know birth death disease we are experiencing these things and we can relate to even sometimes our greatest enemy cuz they're going through the same things as well and so we find a lot of common core things for a person on their spiritual Quest and had to apply some type of Truth to help your car stay on the ice and the road so to speak so my goal was to help people see themselves through my quest and the writing process was sort of
 excruciatingly painful but I'm very glad that and when I finally done the publisher cut out like 200 plus Pages because they're like up doesn't help the ark
 I just had a sort of surrender and I was like the second story they were Relentless in a wonderful way
 but can you tell us about the
you're working on now
 yes I'm writing about a meditation their Journey it's not just a book on how to meditate but how to make a journey and it's also about an hour it is a starting with three sections one is to invest in the second section has to do with finding the true self and the third section is all about connecting the Divine my whole idea is I I think we have stopped to become to be human beings instead most of us are human doings
 all human thinking's or human dressings
woman tattooing resting in your true self the authentic authenticity it's all about ya havin doing the thinking but not about being yourself and I think that road which we have mistakenly taken to the outside world needs to lead us into the inside were to the true self and to that end I offer a journey which tries to accomplish that so I expect everyone who reads my book to become a self-realized and Blissful human being good
a course would be to go hand-in-hand with the workbook yes yes it's a journey starts on one apart when you when you step out of the door and then they are many things which happen until you reach your ended how to deal with these things which happen and I so understand standing in the meditation pod which will be there are you which is there it's just meant to internalize the teachings and anchor them that they need because there's so much theoretical knowledge we have heard all so much over this self heck self-help heck I think you said English language really into hacks
any shortcut we can take for is possessed knowledge or a plain old knowledge practice the small things with Stitches throw at you including myself I have also done this a lot is not so helpful as you know giving people a meditation a journey something to do till her eyes at the conclusion so I worked on it 5 years ago. It was is my shortest book which I've ever eaten in my life but it's five years and if you ask me when will sachidananda swamy give birth to the book when does it come out
I would say buy now
 it's just now coming out to exactly when the just now is it has to be decided by someone else send me that sounds beautiful I did something came up with me so I maybe I'll start off these questions
 when talking about adopting a spiritual culture
 and you know I always consider myself very unique and very sort of non-conformist it in a lot of ways expecially isn't a teenager
 how do we how do we overcome the fear of losing personal identity by getting into a spiritual tradition is that question makes sense because we want to keep our uniqueness about it we don't want to be cookie cutter but it seems like if I join a church and institution and
from it's like where's my individuality going how much room is there for individuality like in the Army you need soldiers you don't need the guy to just do go off and do his own thing you need people are going to fall into rank-and-file for the greater good of some things but it seems like it could crush a person's free spirit what would you say to that
 I have seen that a lot when a person comes into a spiritual movement or spiritual lineage or a tradition that's how many things but she adopts perhaps a new style of eating habits Sasaki this is not okay then rules for the spirit of Technic you know sit down to this
that and so on and instead of going the path of self-realization he could go the parts of self-restraint judgment by doing all these things which are not really and cut it in his I know my generation to be part of the group I wanted to be part of I had to get this bell bottom trousers do you do yesterday like they're back now I think I liked very much dancing and jumping over fences and I would always be caught
for me it would have been better to have two of these trousers Which Wich close at the ankle that they don't get hung up and eat but no to be a music lover to be a follower of The Rolling Stones until I appreciate the doors Jim Morrison that all must be looked upon with Angry Eyes appear that other style of the same thing could happen when you go into a spiritual tradition that you can adopt things which are not favorable to you and I have a quote this is the only quote which I have today
I don't know if possible either Mark Twain or Ralph Waldo Emerson both of them from your country you said to be yourself and have a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment so yes it could happen that on the spur to part A or B o u r made into something else then yourself and I think the this is a wrong understanding of self realization is itself estrangement
 I like that thank you I got it too and I get that part of the spiritual practice is actually
 a distinguishing from what I thought was myself
my quote individuality but was really just sort of my ego just showing off in different ways to get attention and get validation and get people to think I'm cool it's got nothing that says all I do is self-realization now it's just me on my own ego trip in a different way thank you you're usual shop miss you come to a very important point is a shin is not Eagle realization that's very important to notice the eagle is a is the Eternal mask maker in all this puts a Persona on top of you that you are not so but it's also not follow blindly anyting you know so you have to find the survey really it's not this is not that but it's
I think it has to do with one verse from the Bhagavad Tamil there it is said on the ghina expert apart you should there should be three realizations which happened and by these three realizations you could measure it is my pot going all right these realizations and now it's good to pay full attention away from the ship back in front of you
 joking joking so this is this like this it sounds good it says bhakti partition anubhav ovisac.
and so on so you should feel some boxes of love in your heart you should feel some experience of divinity it shouldn't be any longer if you have not realized it you need to apply the past to your individual needs and you should see that you lose your obsessive hunger for material distractions which are not really not rushing you or anything should happen as natural and as safely and Shirley and observably sd33 things happen to show to happen when you eat when you eat you can see that you are eating something healthy by
first of all the feeling of satisfaction then the feeling of nourishment oh I'm getting good food he is becoming now very
 satiated and finally you should have a feeling I don't need to eat any longer of this is a good meal it's a gives you satisfaction nourishment and you don't need it to take anymore so I'm just a thought you said inspection is been this love coming in your heart back to your nourishment is when you experience something about Christmas presents and arrangements and directions in your life and the third is you say thank you
attached to this particular activities that I'm Smith so yes so that is not fitting into the crowd not feeding your ego but making genuine spiritual experiences with love in your heart and yes something concrete that you experience and then you can say bus finished I don't need this any longer I don't need to be the most beautiful man in town I don't need eggs regularly running through my mind thank you Morris I think I do answer
now and we're doing questions from our live live audience it's all the people that are with us so we got a short list and we're going to start we're going to dive into the deep water first and ask bunke AKA about to Justin to come on down Justin he traveled with me throughout Europe and India and
 live with me across America and he was assisted me and he's like a good brand of our family and inspiring part of our community
 Justin come on clothes are happy to have you here going to give you the mic and you got to talk right into the mic yeah a little introduction that was a little bit of this a little bit more about yourself if you want okay I just know what her eyes I could never see buddy
 I'm Justin but he called me bunke and you guys know his monkey I was
you always talk about how I met you just like okay so I was kind of a crazy party kid working at like bars in New York City gay bars and I'm making lots of money and then the shutdown happened the Corona virus happened and I was kind of forced to just sit in my room and started meditating and
 can I pick up old practices that I had learned to see no various places and Robbie not the kind of came to mind cuz I had taken yoga with him for years prior and I looked him up and he was on Joe Rogan so I watch The Joe Rogan podcast and then I got I have watched it was in the stages through that and then slowly but surely was another stay just kind of like to me in and I was indoctrinated into the cult of love and
but I also I before bhakti I was a performer I have besides working and bars I was a drag queen I performed three or four nights a week very demanding kind of overwhelming lifestyle physically mentally and it has like it's one of those things like it becomes an obsession it really takes over if you want to be good anyways you know you really have to give your whole life to it and is that enough of an intro to say he was also very good at it too cuz if you don't know. I work in the drag queen bar in the 80s it's what we did back then every the eighties everything just sort of merged together and it's like a whole performance if you're unfamiliar with it and he's such a great singer Entertainer dancer and so where does this leave us with your question today
 so I mean I was going to say like I went to school for acting
dancing and dancing and all that drive was kind of like the culmination of all of it it was a way of me performing but not having to go to the Avenue of being a regular actor I didn't have to go to Shenzhen didn't have to suck up to casting directors I can just go and perform and do my own thing it was great so my question is still and
 I got very serious about my spiritual life I served in Iraq for a year
 and after that year was over I got kind of an opportunity a casting director reached out to me from the television show and wanted me to audition and I kind of got sucked back into that world into the drag world and I thought I was going to be better at it because I was sober now and what I ended up happening was I was very disappointed when I went back into that world that was I had to talk to people
I can't deal with people who are drunk in a silver bat in the silver way which is very difficult for me and not good at small talk so and I was super uncomfortable
 cuz you have to be the center of attention in your on all the time even when you're sitting in the corner doing nothing you're on
 so it didn't I didn't really pick it up very much and I kind of feel like I'm in a holding pattern like I don't know what to do and I've been offered another opportunity where I'm going to be performing in Portland Oregon at the queer Arts Festival and I'm going to be there for two months and there's two actually two shows two separate months and it's a big deal and I guess I'm a little conflicted like I don't know
 I don't know if this is good for my bhakti it's going to be a trickle setting it's not like a bar or club so there's that you know but I'm feeling like I don't know if this is harmful to my
and I but I also know like there's value in it and I think that in my heart I believe I can do it for Christian I believe that it can be done in a way that
 is suitable for serving Krishna
 I guess I'm asking for direction in a way it says if that clear
 it's like a person who's
 an actor or a singer and Entertainer it's hard to get that quote gig that pays you money in America you know you're trying to lie like pounding the pavement and here is this golden opportunity
 we are pleased that the issue is that drag is inherently even when you're not around drunk people it's inherently highly sexualized at subversive irreverent and insulting you know and that's where it's at its power and its value lies you know
put that big pile on your lap Maharaj
 glad you're here about her eyes
 the best Festival II's yes I saw you in that very creative outfit and was totally impressed it is it I saw it's an art but more than that I really don't know but I would never wear you added a few adverbs to describe but it is
 here is something which I highly recommend you to do just ended it's something which I feel could help everyone of us to find the sin
decisions like like this of on Vegas where you don't know should I take the opportunity or should I better refrain from the opportunity
 I would say try it a little bit without selling your soul and see what happens with your Consciousness how you react and so on it you might even in the trying face and you try things have have someone who understands you and discuss it with him and then it's easier to jump off the train when it's not yet to Rolling the full steam or to continue and giving speed in it I would very much like
give you an example where I live that I would not wish to buy have been guess it's because all it is is so small a shrimp at the banks of an idyllic like it is called to go above and you've also visited us one year when you traveled with the to enter I don't know if I showed you but from the garden gate that is a little path which goes to the forest which now looks like a jungle and I went I made this path is my own heart and the way I meant made it is I started to walk
 and see her here is not so good he is at Victory or here is a lot of undergrowth so I go
rounded end on my as I walked the Bountiful romantic path. Which is so beautiful that next time you come I will show you my part this part is happy at my I've walked it I could not know how to go add some things in life are appearing while you walk the same decisions you can't do do not let us say you say oh this odd is
 too much for me to handle and I'm now in a different mindset to do it now if you say on this theoretical assumptions I don't do it therefore you might sit in your our Shaman thing
oh this is so tempting this odd is so great and in your mind you might be on Thousand drag stages ostrow dreaming of drag it just said you are you mind is so I think this has been put on your part by your, this particular art you don't have to show Private Parts or something yeah it good yeah I mean so so then you you go then I would say go and if that is a rocky terrain a steep climb you have a rope around you
which is tied to a good position of faculty and if something happens and we keep you dangling on the road still connected this this is your your decision sounds very colorful but we are all put before decisions but I really don't know relationships for instance how can anyone know if the beginning of a relationship if that will be fulfilling and nourishing and and mutually helpful you have to walk a little and then see the deposit PS before you then after some time it's very clear very clear and then you won't sit in your I sure am performing a thousand
stages in the mind
 good answer good answer thank you we love you
 very good answer Marsh make you a pot sappy of and you walk them yeah not on your theoretical planning board short
 what was like the bug of agita set in transit it give it one of you want to give it up and then know you got to go do your duty but you got to do the Krishna conscious way
 okay next question next question is by one of our favorites on this trip Miss Claire come on down come on Claire
 Claire is a friend of mine married to a good friend of mine and she always takes care of me when I go visit them in San Diego and Ramona California and
friend of my family's and my kids we stay at their house and she's a great mom she's great wife she's great school teacher and how you doing how's your trip what's been going on tell us anything we share about you coming on the trip where you your husband's initiated about a year into a lot of the lifestyle things of the consciences are clean living your athletic you're into you need to clean diet but were you were you a little hesitant to come to like a hairy Krishna ashram and Italy or was it like this is cool and everyone loves you
 no I said there's lots of things that I love about Krishna conscious it besides the clean living at the serving others living a positive life. I've always loved all of those things about it so perfect and we're happy you're here
what's your question today it's very deep and philosophical I think it's just a pretty basic one that there's probably you know that public people struggle with all the time I think
 with it himself I'm sure is finding how do you find balance especially cuz I'm a type A personality finding balance in your life and not trying to always be perfect at everything and you know being down on yourself when you're not perfect in your spiritual life or your relationships or your practice
 should I answered both of you you yeah yeah
 see I'm a poster child our parents or Europe disintegrating but you know they was bumping going on German
he was only troubles at the end and my father was one of these people survivors from the boy who wanted to build up Germany again and therefore you can imagine what type of values I heard when I was a child you have to do things you have to excel you have to help us get the transport system okay I should text would be a good job for you and you need to do it go to you need to really growing up in a niche Eva's mentality and a perfectionist perfectionist at that that voice up my indoctrination and when I came on the spirit apart I was very
I'm happy that I could not rise early in the morning when I slept I was very unhappy when my bad days but I was as you say in America under the clouds you know and could not do this nicely I when I gave lectures and I couldn't remember one worse I work beat myself up afterwards and so on and so far I know the tyranny of perfectionism and what I can do with you because you're never good enough in your mind once you become a member of this idea of perfection Alyssa I want to tell you Claire bear I'm now of the 50/50 plus driving that I'm already or not man I don't look like this and I don't feel like this but after 50 plus
yes I said 40 plus I have not even started
 I want to tell you where I'm standing now
 I believe in a loving God now not a judgmental God someone who is like a parent who is happy about the broken language of his child you're speaking he speaking he says something it was only so I believe also now that in spirit and life you need to try to give your best whatever that is but then let let
Krishna do their nest it's not I'm not perfect that is one Saint in the Bloch his Holiness knows him well who used to live on top of it sacred Hills so whenever you need to follow Nature's call he felt he should go down the hill to pass urine into everything else there that do not put it on the head of the Holy Mountain Soto cell phone it's really down without touching the hill so that was his feeling so at that time now that is so kind of relationship pipes
goes down at that time that used to be tigers in the version up to me to tell you that night I don't know if you ever did but it says scary things you sit there and do your Natures called the tiger is perhaps because you have done this in his sleeping bag so you know it's really nothing I said to be confronted with a ferocious tiger who might be angry and the night so this this personality is name is Robert Bob but he was asked how he is dealing with the Tigers and he showed a little stick and he said I have my stick
then he was as smart and the rest is done by Krishna this is the type of spirituality which I find very good I do my best I do but without this crazy Obsession it must be perfect but I give what I can do and I think the rest is taken care of and there is a a text in the Gita Krishna speaks about what he thinks he says someone who's on the right path may may do some may have some force and make mistakes but I could
famous saying because he's rightly situated he's he's moving on so so this idea of perfectionism which you might find from your education all that you might somehow I mean the rest of society is a lot about that he who is Oshie was more Adept and doing something gets more money and more followers on Instagram that you know that is very much embedded in the butt on the spirit apart that is not necessary this view of life
 I was at a thank you thanks Claire pleasure having you be relief
 is a lot of pressure in our spiritual life to especially a tradition that has so many
like layers and layers of rules and etiquette send that address and how to part your hair and how to how to put on your T lock Indian chant the Mantra right it's like it's an overwhelmingly International Society of rules
 yeah and that was it sort of brings in our next question and have David Charles Wilson come down David is there another part of our local family now six thousand miles away is Davis from Philadelphia but he sort of part of our super-soul community back home how are you for real quick to see you
 it's sort of like leading into your question too because they're always a sort of attention of like how can I do more
 and we suffer from this feeling of I'm not good enough you want to I want to share first how you got here and we need to talk her into the mic wanted you to see yourself in that little box
metal box that box right now you won't have to Gangnam if I see first and we'll of course you know I owe a lot of it to you and that I was practicing transcendental meditation for many years
 and
 starting to reach the phase of life where where you lose things those people lose relationships lose a life that you've felt and
 miss you in Boston at one point and
 the story of Joe penny for the first time
 and this idea
 of
 personality of godhead struck me as opposed to
this idea of
 chanting mantra in my head
 to feel better
 and
 you were
 welcoming and kind enough to invite me to farm and as things locked down in the world the farm became one of the only places where people are gathering
 don't get me in trouble here we we were all six feet apart and it it it depend
 my my my interests my curiosity and it it built this affection for the community and that that kind of has
crossed over into New York City and and subsequently did Philadelphia where you know my
 my my world is about spending time and serving the devotees and so I appreciate that but as you both represent two of the
 most important teachers in my life I wanted to in this is strictly hypothetical but the idea of about feeling unqualified comes up I miss some you know how does an aspiring student contend with feelings of inadequacy lack of confidence or unworthiness and their relationship with with their teachers
 and you know what if Mirage if you have advice on on how how we can address these these doubts we might feel as students
yeah you can imagine
 that's a V first vestan US who came in contact with Sheila Prophet who is who who had come from India to is deeply embedded in the spirit of tradition of Krishna consciousness of Gaudi a violation of his name and all that it would really be embodied all this teaches you can imagine how we felt it is it is it in his presence I still remember that one time when I was called to ProCuts room to give him a money massage he was an elderly person that he took a massage each morning then I felt so
so an adequate ultralight I had said I'm an expert Messer I had no idea of massage for him my light is spilled over my forehead and I remember looking down left and right portions of sweat episode nervous and yeah
 remember how she loved Paul but at that time looked upon me. First of all and then he told me about do the massage like this he could see that I have no idea how to massage
and then he said something which way I felt he he was accepting me with all my my thing you know he he gave me for instructions she said that students should be for things he should be a first of all the good disciple then he should himself should be a guru you should teach what he has learned to others and he should be helping you should be kind to others by doing direct service for them and finally should be a little independent he should be able to talk to you should not depend on others so
 yes I vote
my own Spoto Master being very happy with the whole section under brahmacharya and guiding him from the Heat verse I think genuine spiritual teachers can integrate mistakes and in the end please help me with a difficult Road in equities what is it that you interact with adequacy yeah yeah they can deal with it they can integrated and they don't become judgmental because of that we be sure to what they don't like is pretense
 let me try to give an image of ourselves that is not because you can teach a person
who is Barry of inadequate but you can't teach a pretender
 so so spiritual teacher sees as how we are they can do what they wish to do guide as forward but when they see us trying to pretend what can they do you what can you do for a person who suffers when you asked me what can you do for him we have so much of I'm fine the people don't they are not longer in contact with themselves what can you do better is someone who is who is who is that
see sometimes we carry our concepts of life into the spiritual terrain spirited Arena and a life you always need to be so God or appear to be so good to be loved in the spirit of life you just need to be yourself honest and that's a different value system
 I hope that answers your question to some degree of satisfaction that's a great answer a question perfect questions and perfect answers
 there's always going to feel that have that feeling of inadequacy isn't right it's normal for the student what are you doing can I ask a question in that regard there are people
perhaps due to some absentee parent or abandonment that they never feel adequate. Even if they are adequate and never feel
 worth even if they're trying to message you wear these things to have you come across students like that there's just sit a deep self-loathing how do you help a person like that that even if you say how you're doing wonderful here you're a great person you're doing good still they hear it all as theirs almost like demons shouting them down
 have you come across people like that and it how do you how do you help with the person who just cannot hear
 I had a guest who was an old man 77 years old or 78 perhaps from Germany
it's up to me I knew him occasionally on and off and he came by a shaman said can I talk to you I I suffer with something I might message you yes I hope I can say something that is Meaningful and then he just came out and said whatever I do I feel I'm not good enough and then he use that word I suffer from self-loathing clothing and he told me the extent of it and yes it is I recognized when he talked the little voice in me who's doing the same thing it's not as loud as well but it is it is there
 and you know what I did after I have certain that that's look objektiv lead move out of your you're
find and see and I get we could see this this this this this and I'm not just saying it to flatter you but others have also seen this is this this is and so on do you doing good and so on nothing worked and then I just embraced him like this
 I kept him a little bit in the Embrace a little longer and he started to cry and then he said thank you when I said that you need someone to embrace you from time to time so far but maybe you should have friends who can I could love you the way you are
