 it's nice area Mara a little cookout last night we harvested peaches yesterday peach trees are out of control peaches peaches pears plums yesterday was quite exciting day at the park I was like this is the joy of Life walking around picking peaches from a tree it doesn't get better than this
at least the material sphere sphere is much higher something but walking around picking fruit from your trees it's hard to real sign that there is a God who's providing for you is so like heavily Laden with fruit and a pear tree to it's like we're going to put people out of business with these roll-your-own cigarettes it's like it's going to destroy your entire hapless economy actually it all grows on trees there's a massive return on investment get your nut and fruit trees in the ground today if you haven't because I planted a lot of these eight years ago and they're all just coming forward now it's quite exciting isn't it exciting we have a special guest today a good friend of mine radhika Prabhu from England from England yes and he's an incredible kirtan leader and travels the world doing kirtan leaves retreat
please pilgrimages leads does everything it sees he's quite amazing radhika welcome to the show on how are you well of you Saints and sages it's great to finally get you on the podcast
 yeah it's great honor and privilege I mean you guys weld wide known across the buck see while the scriptures that goes a joke about wisdom and sages and I'm feeling fomo or nothing no I'm not well wanted to say that the great the great people are always chanting the Holy Name there might be some Fame in this world people can get you can become like you know Taylor Swift and you get Fame in this world but the devotees of Lord Vishnu or traveling and singing the glories of mission of your famous throughout the three Worlds the three planetary systems so they say it's great to have you and you know I wasn't even quite sure because I live in a tiny little rock and rock.
but when I was going to England last year they said I should do something with radhika at a Tome nom nom nom
 and I wish I'd had no idea what I was doing and I was on a whirlwind trip of something else so I just sort of showed up and there you were you had this first this beautiful venue and
 packed with beautiful people and matter fact we were in your car driving there do we drive together did I drive with by 1 and I can't remember but I left my listening to you in the car I might have been you driving the car
 I'd like nursery school but it is you're such an eloquent gracious humble
hope your day is a good really makes accurate on singer great is their humility and they're not that they don't have necessarily A Showmanship but you really get the feeling of it's not about them and that's what I really love and appreciate about you riding approval is your your drawing people together for prayer and it just comes out in the holy name and you happen to be directing it but it's not like it it's the radhika show it is quite wonderful in that regard you want to talk a little bit about kirtan the potency and perhaps
 how to do it if it had to do it if people are interested or maybe something what is it called Pro tips on leading a kirtan I mean I'm without my duck say I'm not one to to teach about here it's on but I'm trying to be a practitioner fast and foremost then I guess anything's good that you saw him he was seeing me is definitely my teachers and and I'm standing on your shoulders
but you're a great guy to mental for me from even though we don't speak you know daily but just for me to observe the way you conduct your life makes me feel inspired and give me example and I like to say this that you know if there's anything good that you see in me and probably my teachers and if there's anything bad in me is definitely me and blessed with many many wonderful guide. I guess with kirtan imma chanting God's name far and wide it's not something that I have a plan on doing it wasn't part of my life strategy but it became that way you said it wasn't no it wasn't a part of the time I'm a chubby Brown kid from London UK another it's not destined in one sense to me to have
 audiences of this size of another plan for that but what's incredible is that through the process of transition through the practice of sharing kirtan
it's become even more clear to me that I'm not the center of the universe and we talked about the wife's email it to you the first thing that comes to mind is this definition I had by a wonderful person but to take a Swami sez. Humility doesn't mean to think less of yourself I'm so crap I'm solo I'm nothing right now you're self but to think about yourself less beautiful and so that's what this is giving me as a gift in my life that it's healthy to not be so self-absorbed all the time just dealing with the regular music business you know I was like Abby if not a c Raitt musician but you know I witness friends become like
 irate musicians like they become like National celebrities and when you go into those circles
you start to see how Fame
 can ruin a person's life we always say I'm sure she'll Good Karma can ruin your life and in the kirtan seen unless than in this isn't a very important thing while you're
 getting into kirtan or leading kirtan or be coming at 2 your time seeing yourself kirtan has to go hand-in-hand with transcendental knowledge and you might hear a great Saint always just think your tongue always just a ton yes that's true but the same time it's understood that you're studying Vedic teachings otherwise you can be the center you can you can make the Cure time I've seen this again again be all about you and then you get swept up in the waves of the very dangerous Karma of I am the center name is powerful I enjoy this type of Fame look at all the validation I was nothing you know
little brown brown kid growing up I was I was a Dopey little punk kid in high school and all the while people are understanding my greatness it's not begging for inflamed comes to it but to fulfill that illusion and therefore make you immensely miserable they need always to divert the pain that Fame has caused it's like it it's like a child dealing with high-voltage exactly that she says only to realize it was never between you and them anyway it was always between you and God
 and this reading of the bog of time you just accept such a good foundation in anyone's life but specialist specifically for those who are looking to share trancing because otherwise we lose the whole point of the kirtan kirtan means
which means to glorify and praise God and so if we're not doing that then we're inadvertently going love me love me praise me praise me look at how I can sing this now that you're not my daddy I'm so yeah
 without the the philosophy if it comes to a sentiment it becomes just I'm feeling a what am I feeling for who am I feeling for who am I training this month what is it all about it's the subject matter of the Mantra which is the Supreme the Divine excetera Krishna you are definitely pepper pepper in it with transcendental wisdom do you want to tell us a little bit about omnom especially for it we have people that go to UK that live in the UK that may not be familiar with it tell me what's going on there because it didn't seem like a regular Harry Krishna Temple but it seems very connected to the Baca community and I thought wow this is so cutting-edge and cool
saintly person by the name of buck the truce while me and he had this Vision when he's no longer with us but he had a vision while he was with us to open different types of ways in which people can connect with Krishna so whether that be dope two surgeries dentist going to Own by devotees the restaurants yoga space is xcetera and so he left that Vision behind and his direct disciples namely Naveen Krishna your shoulder suit is incredible incredible passes but I basically owed my life to these because of our amazing save the people they decide to take it up as a mission they decided that okay let's try and so they created the Avanti schools foundations are here in the UK we have schools which are National curriculum so they still teach National curriculum of the UK but they have temples in them and they have morning Worship in them that's bhakti Krishna scented and so that's
that in itself is an episode like they're actually public charter schools right under public estate state-funded makes me want to raise a whole batch of new kids I thought you were okay I'm holding you to that I might have to come and take birth again just so I can be part of your to Tanya's movement as a as a Groves and gets more and more exciting if you're doing it I'm doing it too I was also aware of you again I'm done with another brainchild of these wonderful devotees who then went on to make a restaurant in central London and as soon as they opened covid hit so it was like the worst time to open a restaurant and everything was
backs against the wall and we had these amazing wonderful wealthy persons that would just providing the full to make sure that the restaurant stays open and at that time John who many people know Genevie Harrison she moved to the states and at that time just before covid hit her and I would doing a bunch of your time together I'd be like the organized trying to manage things with the project will carrots on London of them side Ananda Monet and Jaime Rodriguez one of the bodies but she left for the states and there's a gaping hole in the London Community if all these regular then gone and now all of a sudden it stopped and so they asked me if you want to do a regular spot and I said sure and the first week I wrote that with my harmonium and if I pass in band and maybe 2 people showed up like all this is going to be all still people in the band that in the audience it was intense intense butt
I've got this rule that if you just consistent and you have an intention to serve then the magic happens consistency the sincere intention equals a crystal magic that's a great take away let's take away
 I know it's a blessing and community of people who are everything from those that were full-on pump Leathers all the way through to people that are watching in the banking sector it's a whole tooth or it's not just the people going to Wellness and people are tracked it and that's giving me so much faith that in Omaha for booster seat in the mop it was said that another ID drama will you be mad or nah every town and Village every street-corner they'll be the chanting and I was like yeah, I'm like really like it but now I'm saying it's yeah it's really transform in the world and giving us a lot of Hope and give me a lot of
direction for the first time I can see like oh there's actually a lot in common with different spiritual Traditions I can appreciate what people really appreciate it I don't know if other people focused on their spiritual packs and appreciate what we're doing or if they think well you know they're looking for what we're doing wrong we spend a lot of time and seeing commonality and I think that's a very beautiful thing
 I'm curious just it in the cultural way because you grew up your Gujarati correct yes sir it seems like your parents generation yeah my father was born in Nairobi Kenya my mom was born in India but in the 80s it was just thought it was like a popular thing everyone's migrating different parts of the wild and my parents end up in the UK and in 1991 was my time so
so you show your second year the first Airborne in England known as the Pocono I feel like I'm Brown on the outside by Barry White on the inside I'm just been accustomed to the college I feel you know if I didn't have an Indian household I mean everything else about the way I eat and live is very very blessed and very wet okay so what about your parents that generation of a Gujarati is coming or Indians coming with are they very religious or were they sort of like you know what we got to make a we've got to make a plans move for economic development and nothing wrong with that but it seems like there was a big mass of like let's move to Toronto to New York to to London you get your spirituality from them will you say or did you bump it up to them or they can tolerate you yeah that's a good point I mean my mom's religious and has always been
by religious I mean she had a ritual for every day of the week and fast on my dad on the other hand wasn't so much and you see how does a little affection for Hanuman and a little affection for the wrong but I think it's just family oriented it wasn't it wasn't a practice Factory you just called to about these are to say and then in 2007 I got invited on a used trip a used bucktee trip and yeah there I was just trying to figure out what this whole thing was my parents it's shipped me off and told me that it was going to be good for me and I got Charmed into it by a bunch of months days or something like that I didn't attended a single thing on the last day I decided you know I'll give it to go I'll sit in the temple room and sing a little Hari Krishna with these people and I said the back of the room because what cool kid was at the
I saw the back of the room with a bunch of my friends and at the end of the year to visit picture which I'll never publicize it will never show in any publication of me dancing with the tea shed that was way too tight for me I'm like raised arms raised in the t-shirts like fully over my belly I'm crying tears cuz I'm feeling like this was just one of those moments I felt a connection that was less ordinary and so that changed my life I think that like 8th grade
 2007 Grand 24 17 years back I was 18 years old 17 years old. They weren't like Gotye vaishnava as they were just sort of like there's like an Indian summer camp kids and we'll get into drugs and picks up
elicits actually send you out of camp with with some monks with a bunch of other Indian kids like yourself and then all of a sudden just some weird little magic happened even though you were done yeah it really came to a front when I went to university cuz I was dipping a toe and I was like these Christian is a dietitian is a cool but I don't know you still want to taste the wild so I got to University and yeah I remember standing in the club and just thinking this is really gross like I just can't do this this can't be my life so I came home sat on the edge of my bed girlfriend now wife so managed to make that work but she came in to get you out of it and she said I don't want to do this anymore she's breaking up with me
 no no no no no no just the opposite kind of like the spiritual stuff and I
electrician about to you and I want to share that with people so we went the next morning to the university and we printed out these flyers which said on them what would you do if you have 24 hours to live that was the topic of the the kind of society we are going to create and stood out in the cold and she goes to me what do we do next just pray it as a Christian I will go out to whoever is out that give me some strength until I open my eyes and the fast pass tonight and the flight so I gave him a whole spiel about what we were going to try and do and the next day when the event was happening I put three chairs out so that no one's going to fall for this stuff like Hua University College is going to want to know about Foxy and spiritual life and 75 people showed up in the first event and not care number 3 years wait a second this happened just after that summer camp later know this is maybe a couple years they say I've been with the devotees
OK Google look at it makes sense I thought you got back from summer camp and you just started deciding now I'm going to leave at that one little trip though triggered something in you and change the whole trajectory of your of your life and some of us remember that point you know they say one moment association with the Great's all can change your life and we've had these also magical moments with bhakti whether it be you're in the Bog of time being inaccurate on going to a holy Place seeing the deity
 nom nom nom nom
 Didi's in the bodies Nom Nom the Holy Name.
disassociate with the bodies in a way and it and it leaves like an impression we we say it's like a fishhook that gets caught in the heart and then you just can't get away even if you're like well I like it but it's not for me it's are the hook has been set and then your material at this crude matter what you do it's just like that but I missed it but I missed the philosophy but I just have a good time I miss the deities and people can't get it anymore and then you're left trying without even the appropriate language DVD Express yourself you're trying to explain it to your friends your family your parents and they're just like what I know what you're wanting you went back to the spiritual master and he goes jump jump really bother you giving me you made me come by Chancey in Chancey may be mad
what is this stuff you've made me pagal his it says Papa go to Karina parga really made me mad I always use that word puggle acting a little puggle you know my son also you know he he
 you know we always have Krishna Consciousness in our house since he was little but it's when he started connected on one of those youth trips where you work with all your friends is probably a little different cuz these kids are also raised as devotees to but those bonds you make a friendship of those kids in bhakti when you weigh it out next to material culture material call Theresa flimsy or there is an irresponsible teenager who's just womanizing or absorbing romance or were smoking pot or whatever like that it seems
so
 cheap compared to the substance of going to a temple and singing together and I will say this is true amongst American devoted kids or Western devoted kids and Indians you never see such beautiful but male bonding like just boys holding hands with other boys button dancing with other men you don't see that outside of a bar where everybody is drunk it's just like a beautiful non-sexual jaw and in this is sort of what the beauty about like Bart natyam dance thing is kirtan it's something you have a same activity because center right you're the center of your time
 but you're not doing it for you or your dancing very beautifully but it's not the me dance check me out it's actually even the dance of Bart not even more than the classical dances of India it's a glorification of God it's
unique in that regard we just did this like how how long ago was 1 weeks ago I was at this festival with may be opposed to a thousand people that I'm attendance I don't know what came over me and I just said to the audience look left and right right behind and they held each others hands and they were looking a bit Shifty about it but I said let's just trying to get a couple of times and when we try let's just be grateful for one another and let's pray for one another and said that a way you can tell to my Instagram page it says that they're raising their hands that wall like China and even there's a few people that looking left and right with tears in my eyes just Cuttin I wouldn't do this even if I was drunk and I just to be rounded with other people through the medium of chanting Divine Ames it sounds Preposterous even as I'm saying I'm like that sounds weird and you know maybe it's a bit airy-fairy in a bit woozy but there's something about a Divine connection that makes us feel United that we feel that yeah we're on a Jenny
together even though the Jenny's may be completely different and they look into it if there's something that unites us a not obviously we understand this being the Krishna factor that deep down within will feel the super so we feel there's something inside this list that's very much
 similar and familiar with one another Christian affect the Krishna fact I like that way people can follow you on Instagram or social media should I quit quickly and I just want to also share that there's something about like okay I'm going to go to class my teachers chanting so I'm just going to get a quietly respond and then I sort of like the chanting little so I go to the kirtan and I sit there and the singer singing but I'm going to quietly responded again loudly respond
 there's another thing when you start a hold hands with a person that's where like it's a little bit more someone's in my space I'm in their space I'm sort of I'm because I'm becoming a little bit more public and then there's a thing where you dance and that's a no
nothing worse or like
 alright this is getting some of this is going somewhere else
 and then sometimes I've had people I was like okay you guys really like this we're going to walk up the street and do this and there's like what it's like you're going up the street or you're sitting down in a park and you're all sing together and it just like layers of ego or just shedding right in front of each of those powerful thing we do it when we go on pilgrimage in India and
 you know I think a lot of people maybe even never been in a public here time but they like your tongue or they like us or they have faith in the Holy Name a little bit and so then we go to holy cities and we just sit down in the temple run the streets run that in the end the bank of the ganga and we start singing and the reaction of Indians in holy places
 they're just like loving it they're so like validating what we're doing and there
this is a holy place this is what you do in a holy place you come here and sing and it it's such a it feels so good for the people doing it you could just see the The Joy on their face when there's something about doing it publicly that nog are sunk your tongue you like singing is the is it's so weird that is the form of self-realization yeah that's what it is you can actually feel your ego melt you just realize that first and foremost is exactly that you said the ego melting and any feel well it was always between me and God anyway so people don't believe you realize how little you care about what you're doing I think we live in a world where we think so much about what will people say that kills without dreams and I think if you can just let that go a little bit like I don't care what people think all the time yeah I just maybe once a week do something that doesn't involve other people think then I think we can live such
liberated life even if it's not Krishna conscious if someone just looking for a little bit Liberation and the peace of mind and just start by doing something that you don't care what other people are going to think about ya and then beyond that then go and give without knowing even sometimes you're giving people an opportunity to connect with this sound vibration it's it's actually something that makes Krishna want to run and embrace us when we read in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says most years that person who goes out and gives the strands and then to know there's two others and so we may be thinking I'm not really a stage where am I going to do about transcendental much but everything is contained within how do you numb Nama cinta many Christian and Chase and there is a big report in the show 20 Diamond everything's in the holy name is no different from Krishna and so when we go out and give the Holy Name even though we may not know its own power ourselves
 it was a mess with them is Krishna run into our lives because he
feels oh my God this person is giving me to others that's what makes Krishna even more happy then when we just trying to ourselves is going to give it to others he just feels well
 discusses my guy oh my God that's why I got into Punk and alternative music as a teenager because in a in a big public high school that I went to there wasn't an unofficial dress code there was what is cool and what is uncool and to just dressed like me and a couple friends of mine which is dress like ridiculous and it would almost be like not only are you got a knock at accepted by the way your dressing
 you're going to get ostracized and there was like a there was like a pleasure in doing something that the public
 completely finds wrong it's like a Liberation like you know you don't like what I'm doing
fine I'm fine with that I know a fine with that I'm going to go out of my way to look for it but it was it still wasn't for a pure reason but that feeling of I don't care what people think I'm going to do it anyway I don't care and then when you lined up with some like this is actually I'm going to do something for a cause even though the world is against it or something empowering that when you do it for a Divine cause that's really that's really really powerful I'm going to walk I'm going to sing up the street a Loof to public opinion that is the most liberating thing that you can do you ever wonder if you if you feel inspired by this moment like I want to try this just get a pair of cymbals or drum and just go out until Park and I need to make it like the whole revolutionary stand about it but you know you're just letting go of the fear of what will people think about me I'm looking at people on Zoom right now they're like okay
Memphis walking around with a drum in Downtown Memphis gvg and Munich Stromboli I want you see walking around Vermont just sing sing in the Holy Name
 Lee and carp you to this is this is this is it it is very powerful is very powerful and is your I remember my first I've already at this point opted-in like I believe in the stuff I'm turning the holy name and then sell some of the devotees at the temple would like your time in the temple that caught Hari naam which means you go out in public in New York City of course in all the neighborhood places that I hung out in it wasn't like we're going to go to the Upper West Side we're like right on the village right where I hung out I like we're going to go check out in the street when it come Ray and I was like
 yes like okay so I'm still dressed as how I'm
Emily dressed I'm not not looking like a hairy Krishna job is to your musician what are you just like to sing and dance in the front I was like well I think that's a little too much how about if I just hand out cards in the back that was following the kirtan going up the street and I was like 15 Steps behind like these guys are such a degree that I opted and I got a little bit of Liberation like there's a card what do you think of these guys I'm not one of these guys of course but let's face it my pic is pain in this world
 is my ego it causes me so many problems overly concerned about what people think of me and people hurt my ego and my my my revenge for my spider my my enemies out there it's based on my ego
a free man right it's the one thing that's kind of like tying us down to ever making new experiences but the fact is that unless we make those new experiences were going to live the same life that we've always lived and the transformation happens on the other side of new experiences that's where the magic happens in a Einstein says and I'm sure you will know this quote that to do the same thing again and again and again and again and again and expect different results is the definition of insanity
 and so if I live in the same lives that we always have and thinking oh one day I'll transform into this amazing spiritual butterfly the truth is by new experiences is more likely to happen and I remembered exactly while you were speaking about the hiring experienced I remember oh man putting on the Doherty and put it on the T lock and the first time I went out with some people from my school and I was at this is just the most mortifying thing that you could ever do
but now looking back on that experience has given me so much why like to call Krishna confidence
 because living those experiences and then realizing known fee
 initially when you're young and I don't know if this is true but this is a quote that I remember hearing in Michigan were young we care so much what people think about us and then and then sometimes you realize they don't care what people think about you and finally you come to the conclusion that no one was thinking about you in the first place because everyone so self-absorbed and so. Kind of that realization came about like you know maybe a few years outside started chanting and be more public about it and it gave me so much Krishna confidence I was at. I said with that Mother Teresa quote is never between me and them anyway right was always between me and God and because of that connection the vertical connect
my horizontal connection people change completely I wasn't trying to you know love them so they would love me I was letting them because I sold them as part and parcel of my God I love that friends and into this is I love this podcast even higher point to that which is
 how do you say you said it I don't care what you know that people think about me or I'll be like oh I don't have my tea look like no one's home in my house I'm not going anywhere I live in a farm but sometimes it's like I want to put my key lock around because I'm about to do my Pooja I forgot my T lock and I want to see me this morning she woke up and I wanted to know I'm just so when you get to think like I'm dressing for Krishna or I'm going to the temple not to look sexy or cool or hot or you know people will like my new Bundy I'm wearing
but I'm doing it because I want I want to present myself in front of Krishna I want to see that address for him and whenever we were that I'm cooking that even though I'm like the food I'm cooking I'm actually cooking this for you Christian when we can do it with that type of that's the real you go there's a false ego that's like a look at a check out my cool hair check out my cool beard check out my cool singing But woman I can do it for the real ego which is I'm actually part of God and I forgot and now I'm remembering I'm going to do this for Krishna today that's what a video just like literally 2 days ago this bring the oven resident the person that lives in Bryn David and India sent me this video saying the simplest definition of body is that if you're cooking for one
 now make it cooking for two
 if you're shopping for one
 now short for two
 if you're dressing for one now just
so the whole thing is just add Krishna even in the smallest way cuz I love how you said you know if I'm walking around at home it's not about what other people think is what will Krishna think about me that's like giving me goose bumps all over my body I'm like yeah and you know it's interesting because an evil you're talkin me into Super talking about you know your people adopting different diet regimens imagine if you own a diet regimen just eat per shot like I'm just like this food isn't offered with love I don't want it in my mouth and there is something that all these things were talking about transform the conscious best dressing for Krishna transforms our Consciousness cooking for Kristen eating per shot only like cuz cuz now you're focusing your meditation
 this is for Krishna imagine
deliver whole life like that's our meditation otherwise meditation is just you right now how to people if they say I'm going to meditate they don't even say that I'm going to sit I was sitting for an hour until I go very good you sitting for an hour it's like I don't even hear that it's like that then that means you just put yourself on pause for an hour and that's pretty good cuz the mind is racing and it's exhausting but how about I'm doing activity in the world I'm walking around my house to see me Christian to see me I'm going to cook for supper for Krishna right or am I picking food and picking flowers for Krishna and does where does if people either sit in meditation and quiet meditation or what they do is
 they're not into meditation but they're actually meditating on how can I make more money or how can I meet more girls or how can I how can I
this guy drives me crazy we meditate on someone that's driving us crazy hate is a very powerful meditation lust is a very powerful meditation and these are the things that are occupying our mind on it that's what it is it's occupy your mind so we're saying lippitt
 so Krishna is now always occupying your mind that's where we're going with this whole thing and your time cooking dressing up just trying to think how can we please Krishna classical Indian dance or Sanskrit is not to be called upon to Torah scholar a professor into our life into our Consciousness at all time to meditate either way you either met meditate on you and your pains
 we meditate on Krishna make a choice the meditation is going to be there whether you meditate
this meeting meditating how am I going to make it right with that person, going to you know make that doesn't feel the pain that they made me feel or you make a choice is like no it's my meditation by meditation how can I make them feel the pain that I feel is not that's why people like to come and meditation spite of people carrying two people sometimes carry Spite and anger and revenge and resentment sometimes for 30 years and it's like some type of hurt that they've never dealt with and as Weak by the way we're new to bhakti these things will start to come up and we have to start to heal all those things and they will come up if you really want to get past the ceiling in your body you have to start doing all these things like relinquishing these these almost
these things that have been taken from you this if you like your earring like that or something you've been hurt even betray you've been cheated you been robbed you can beat him even if we have to we have to learn a world of forgiveness and letting go and and then the Holy Name becomes more and more powerful I mean even on Retreats with I do like I knew and to International India tracing this and that nothing compared to what he's doing but I'm doing my part in whatever way and people come in those Retreats they see the videos and we go oh my God this look flipping amazing that I need to bill money or trees and I just want them like please come but let me tell you it's no holiday like sitting on a resort that's going to be stuff that comes up because when you come for the first time to kirtan you feel that Euphoria you feel the collective energy if you have connection will maybe you don't but this is common experience of people do and what happens later
down the line or whatever but when you absorb yourself the seven days in a spiritual atmosphere all the stuff that you push on the top it starts popping up like I take people to bring the oven in 22 days people like get me out of here like intense like it's just breaking up oldest room for me it's time to bring up all these thoughts I never thought were there and I'm telling them don't run away from I'm not saying you need to face it right now but just write it down and at least know that I'm not perfect I thought what to do and in that recognition that I'm not everything and I'm not the old Mighty I'm not good in that recognition that I've got work to do humility arises how much humility arises it's easier to reach out for help you know to reach out how Mike Krishna please help me please save me please guide me please give me strength
 please help me face my inner demons I'm looking around on the
resume board right now with a bunch of people that have been on pilgrimage with me and it is like that pilgrimage is hot it's like it's like cooking it it's boiling and things are rising to the top it's not you know you see a picture and someone singing Someone dancing in it and a beautiful edifice of a temple or a holy River it's not backpacking it's not tourism it is like it is like the deepest therapy you can go through cuz it will raise all your realization is the false self stuff comes to the surface at my first pilgrimage that I went on myself as a twenty-two-year-old it was like the universe was holding a mirror in front of my face and see the ugly thing that you were identifying with see all the ugliness you were pretending to be ugly you're beautiful but you're you're not only that you're leaning into your
it is you're trying to show your ugliness it's not even you and it makes you and and you realize you're just using that false ego to impress people to manipulate people and I was just like it was it was so heartbreaking because this is all I know this fake identity is all I know and so this the pilgrimage forces that to the surface if you're sincere and you're just not there if you're actually go into pilgrimage with that Consciousness I want to transform and it's almost guaranteed like it's almost like I think it has been maybe a done maybe how many clothes to 1520 Retreat Snell and each and every single time people go away feeling this lightweight on the shoulders and eyes that are clearly gleaming cuz I've seen something they're seeing the bigger picture and that's not only amazing for them but also faith if I mean for me to go down this process works because you can get I can get you
Krishna Hari Rama going to go no drama and go on pilgrimage and travel the world just seeing the effect of these Divine names on other people's hot and seeing the effect the process on the people it's some it's almost what I live for nowadays it's if ya brought me so much joy and also made me appreciate Christian so much people that been through some intense stuff in my life find going to bring the oven better than being on the Bahamas and that's a sure everything's very smooth and wrinkle-free like the Bahamas sometimes
 there is no impetus to go inside and dig deeper it's just it's almost like a way to stick your head in the sand like everything's good peaceful the water's perfect
 when when you get that the burned oven affect it just tears up everything
if you can't even quite explain it but if you've been there you know it it almost start to lose your mind a little bit and I think it's safe to say we spend that much time together but there's people who really transform and then there's people who were like I can't do this and they just disappear and I just go I can't do this and I find that places like bring David in case it life or no cuz it's nothing like her nothing but when you have had people just got to this point where I go I have to go home right before about to go to bed now or do I have to go home something came up and either like rotten Christian won't let them in or there's something so big they can't confront and they just have to go back and live in a world of
 but you know Maya until either they're ready or two perhaps bury themselves for lifetimes more
that's okay because I'm safe to save everyone and I guess you know in one sense we have to learn how to fly on planes
 you know there's a quote by should have preferred that talks about this that the spiritual teachers are there to help us learn how to fly but at one point Or Another We're going to have to acknowledge that we use flour own claims sure because you know the door of the inevitable time is coming we're all of us are going to have to pass through that gate and as much as we thought the support of others no one's going to be able to walk us there looking after work a little bit long and it's not about loneliness don't get me wrong it's about learning how to live in solitude also I think we live in an age where we now have this phenomenon known as crowded loneliness so it's around constantly thousands of people in an Instagram and constantly all I need to eat lunch with someone it was this way to experience recently why I went to lunch by myself
what are you a psychopath it was this weird people even looking at me and I didn't want to be on my phone you know often the case is when I'm when I'm on my own I might let me just do a little squirrel you know them to see what's going on and what I thought you know what this lunch I'm going to taste the food I'm not a flight to eat in the old days I tried it like it's like I'm sure that's the point is that I wanted to experience what it's like to be by myself cuz if we can't live will learn to live by ourselves were in the west company at all times do I love that it's funny we aren't we have the exact what do they call them like they're these Retreats where you like no cell phones everyone lived everywhere all the time I have a special sexy name for it just hope you
 yeah
save everyone and we have to learn to fly on planes because I like this a lot because sometimes we get we part of the devotional community and some people live around a temple or the Body Center in an awesome around you and I never had that in my post office from Light by always live sort of away from devotees and then if you want it becomes serious about being a devoted you have to figure out how a lot of people listening like I don't know I heard your podcast through Joe Rogan and I live in the middle of nowhere and so in one sense it's harder in another sense if you want it you got to just go for it and you have to create your ashram in your own house if you still want my whole family is not into it then you got to create an ashram within that almost like secretly it within your house you know
 I want you to
at a point in my personal life or I couldn't have a big alter in the house so I said you know what I'm taking this closet in the house and this is my ashram and I made a closet that was my ashram and every morning I do a whole Worship in that if you want it you just got to take it because it's not no one's necessarily going to help you and you got to do it yourself sometimes when you're in a community Thursday night kirtan a New York that's great and the whole Community sort of lift you up I don't care for no one is on this planet it's you and me Cristiano baby you and me baby extra baby and you can have a partner or spouse and they might be Krishna conscious or they may not be Christmas, you can have kids who might be Krishna conscious and then and it's nice if they are but it might not happen and we've got to become so convicted that if the whole world crumbles it's you and me Krishna
and it's great if you can have a little you know support of a community but we have to be ready to do it on our own I really want to do this phone out too it's just it's almost fate that we it's it's the only person that keeps saved on my phone so it's like it's a really special one for me already. Please people are often unreasonable irrational and self-centered forgive them anyway if your kind people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives be kind anyway if you're successful you'll win some face Unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies succeed anyway if you're honest and sincere people may deceive you be honest and sincere anyway what you spend years creating others could destroy overnight create anyway if you find Serenity and happiness some may be jealous be happy and he weigh the good you do today will often be forgot
do good anyway give the best that you have and it will never be enough give you a best anyway in the final analysis my dear friends is between you and God it was never between you and them anyway
 Sodus Point of personal it's me and you baby Krishna you know I was recently told when was the last time that you told Christian I love you and I just looked at the the picture of Krishna in my office here I just looked around I just try to be as sincere as I couldn't I just looked on those no one else watching no timer is only now you guys know I just told him I said I think I love you I love you I want to say it when I really mean it but I'm trying
 anyway I want there to be more time but we're out of time I really want to ask
what would you like to take this you're a big following people watching those videos on Instagram of like you're in a church singing with hundreds of people in a church like so inspiring to see them and where you want to go
 well I'm in a window right now I like to tell people I feel like I'm in a window right now where I'm rather than and people like me and so I'm trying to use that window to share as far and wide as I can that is a public project and has a private project the public project is to try and get people relevant accessible experiences of Krishna bhakti and the internal project is the full madly in love jp24 madly in love with the boy that goes by the name Krishna that's why I'm trying to do that do I need this
