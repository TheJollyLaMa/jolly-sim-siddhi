send Gabe a note to her husband I'm redundant who we love her and she's a wonderful mother and you got right into the microphone you're from Stargate from Bosnia and Herzegovina great English and I'm really glad to be with all of you and how did you hear about your story of how I came to his own personal for the back how did she come to the path of bhakti in the first place I was just in high school actually happened at my friend she she knows something she knew some devotees this is pre Yugoslavia or Post-its
everybody there was that time yes but should be really lived in almost like first line what year how old are you then I was actually getting 14 but it starts at the board and around 18 minutes I got you searching for something more meaningful and I I think so it's like looking at the stars and you know I'm always searching for something higher interesting given before this what I told you that high school like during the war we were it was like basement we didn't have you talked to her place to hide then when was not bumping we will just go out like friends teenagers having fun
and it was just in the streets in in one apartment if you could share a symbols like God tells you to spend there was some devotees sound of the cartel yeah and he was just making fun of Atticus and then it was also a little older than as a friend she was just singing like how to Krishna from the movie here and then one day like bomb exploded in our apartment your old family inside but like old things meant
Alice in some other apartment and in the Shell versus robot book apartment yes yes me and my other books but you know what is this what was the book and profits pictures of the old version black one with them and it was just there and I was just you know I like trying to read but couldn't understand it's whatever I guess I was not ready until 3:16 and then when I was 18 like oh and of my high school and my friends took me to a 2-1 program would like Sunday see something like that
associating with her friend who was devotee and she became the booty and the Beast
 what do I get three or something and 96 + 93 and there's a lot of Yugoslavian people that we brush your teeth. Down there must have been in the Communist is a lot of underground about the activity going on yes yes I mean I didn't know much and that time but later I understood that many devotees they did a great service during the war like you know helping others and we have some very special about these food we're going to hospitals and and don't like that it was just like slowly you know when I was ready I'm also Christian arrange some you know personal
say it may be difficult emotional time that I was like you know
 is this for me or not and then there's not really like I was. That felt like in between you know I still had my old friends and then I was attracted to but you know why I couldn't just like that like shift just chewed through the dream it happened at me like okay before you we want to hear the whole dream now
 had a dream that like a real dream dream like an actual dream actually signaled you look at me and do you know if it's the same like I'm I'm here I'm here for you were once said
like experience long time experience was daydreaming Shield Pro pod and people that are brand new they dream of Krishna
 yes I'm in that dream is just I was like sure I've never drunk and probably been a little crazy say Vishnu I drove the Vishnu once what happened when I was branded ability and I still laid eggs why I challenged you don't have to kill the chicken to eat and he goes he goes because an error because everything that you eat you offer to me and then he said and an egg
 he said like this exactly like this an egg isn't
and I was like yeah sorry the dream of big breakthrough and then I was going to different songs with devotees and we had one maha-mantra club and Reynolds ability and now I'm still having Sunday together a different song Guiding our apartment but that was just ranting Vaughn Randall together sounds like an exciting time to become a devotee just post war and people looking for something and tell the school people that are into different stuff must have felt great ya ya closed and I couldn't do that there might have been imported with others.
so much thinking about that today
 a soul connection with God and you could I want to hear this Lobby in in 89 I want to 8902 East Germany and and it was very very monochrome it was very like the all the Communists architecture was very drab so bright and so when the Wall came down in the Soviet Union collapse and socialism fail it was must have been an exotic car exotic exotic the picture I mean really in for time you didn't have much we were just was from some type of gives a type of Integrity to live through that and to come out
with a positive attitude like you have we loved having you here yet it seemed like that was a lot of really good devotees came from from Croatia from Serbia from Ljubljana from all the time place Slovenia
 Mara wants to know how your weekend we're going to the voice message thing but okay what I want to know how your parents reacted becoming of the body do we not so much about love you say supported in a way but they became very soon vegetarian with us or at least you know you make vegetarian on there like why should we have school on Karma and my sister was you know she still has a friend the family so she was too much

that's how it all started
 yeah okay and then and pray his parents are devotees and then I had to get to listen to Sage's ring cardi B you know I'm a mental health clinician and it was really stressful time and thought it was finding it really difficult part of my clients in a text with the toilet and I just needed some some some connection to have a lockdown right I was Melvin later on that I was in Sydney so yeah I just came across not really heard of you I know I've had a few Christina Prabhu from Bucky Center in New York then I'll send it to you right now so I came across this and I was like wow this is amazing so I was listening to it every day it was My Little Pony saw this

what's on a cat's I sent it to you but the one who played who was rabindranath tagore Venture knot tagore who is a famous polymath
 polymath you need many types of math Bengali probably man subjects with knowledge to solve specific problems but he was a sort of like bodily could be
 mysticism he will he was a poet and he's very famous as a poet
is a writer play write a composer philosopher and social reform education is painter he did it all from him
 I want to plants trees knowing that he or she will never sit in their shade never take some time to plant a tree and have a grill an investment or investment especially at my age to plant a tree it's like never going to grow food fast papayas one year but the tree how long does it take to go all right it's a fact that this is a different this is a different thing this is saying not a papaya tree out his chest nut trees will take a long time avocado trees nine years nine years get out the car to stay on subject here okay that he will never sit in their shade has at least started to understand
the meaning of life what do you think that means you're that is understand like life is just bigger than my existence then why plant a tree
 cuz you're seeing life is you seeing your singing bigger chunks of time
 okay Siri sing a bigger trailer the generational the generational this thing is it for Generations past me so you want to help other Generations in the future you seen outside of your hiney why should you care because you're going to be gone why should you care will that's just part of like a spiritual path like it's not just about me it's about a ongoing sustenance are people hitting our bloodline and not the others in New York you got like the New York State Thruway and if you know it's like a major thoroughfare goes straight across America
the Mass Turnpike in also but it it's that it just wow through like these picturesque arms and you could tell what it was like pre Mass Turnpike it was just picture us farms and valleys and some small roads and then they have a bright idea we got to start moving Freight and they're going to build a massive 69 Highway and they just like it breaks my heart to see these Farms a cut right in half
 I want to talk about this I don't know why it's because you don't like these Orchards were these anyway these bulldozers were there not thinking about the love and care that went into these plant these plantings are here just like we got a deal it's just going to plow everything so it is a little disturbing when you think about p
I actually did care about stuff like this planting long-term thinking of you know that they're not going to be around to enjoy the fruit of that action themselves but to me it's indicating that they understood that I find satisfaction to find happiness through serving
 even though I don't get anything out of it externally right but what I get out of it is getting in touch with my own nature and servant
 are you at all here I'm here he's saying that if you if you're thinking like that everything and let me serve those in the future that I'll never even know that you're beginning to understand the meaning of life okay what how how does it go deeper go deeper and I thought of this I thought of this pot with Hunger is pouring water in the root of a tree energizes the trunk branches twigs and everything else and as supplying food to the stomach
can live is the census the limbs of the body simply worshipping the Supreme percent of godhead for devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods who part of the screen personality and I think not only the demigods it's using its debts being mentioned for particular reason hero living in the beginning of understanding with the meaning of life is is that I'm a servant that I don't need external things I don't eat the fruits of my work to be happy being a servant itself is what it is my nature and how how I drive happiest that's the beginning of understanding me like this is still deeper right that that if I have that same the loving service attitude towards the root of all existence
 definition of connecting with all existence every living being that that formula right there is a form of the bog of time teaches writing
sure
 okay relax you on this one for a while to get you on at all you need to move into the bar with okay
 she done that low glue today pop my brown out sorry to hear that
 just been to a nut. That's my tooth did the crown come out of your mouth to you so late I can swallow the crown is spit it out and then you let you know that that's what happened sound like a little early you weren't sure that that was what happened I'm not sure if there's a peg Post in there or is it a half of tooth in there have to do a little research if you could look in later answer the crown

 what's up respectful Basin sees the Supreme Lord and Ryan trying to reach you this most human being mother's house party the goddess of learning
all this trouble some of the heart become erratic ated and loving service to the Supreme Lord it was praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable Basin Sees at their load of speed-reading from Shabad by what time
 Kansas 7 chapter
 213 we are right in it today yeah we're hearing about running cuz she poo then number one demonic Force Stephen King yeah he's he's on his heart has hatched a plot he's he's going to challenge Vishnu and in the meantime he wants all of his friends to go down and just start tearing everything up on
just taking out the Brahman has any all the positive ritual that's going on and wiping out everything
 so then just stopping to text her to hear us the demons being fond of disastrous activities
 took her Ani Kashi pues instructions on their heads that means I took it seriously with great respect and offered him obeisances according to his directions they engaged in envious activities directed against all living beings
 what do you mean Set Fire to the cities Villages pastor and grounds Cowpens Gardens agricultural fields and natural Forest they burnt the hermitage's of the saintly persons the important mines that produce valuable Metals their mining back then the residential quarters
ultra-ever agriculture agricultural the mountain villages in The Villages of cow protectors the Cowherd man they also burned the government capitals 3 hardballer yes I do in the old days come to town to get burn them to the ground Danbury build a house back then I don't take a while it's on the wood so I can just go to Home Depot I'm sure
 I thought you gave me a little bit more about that
 alrighty some of the Demons to digging instruments and broke down the bridges the protective walls the gates of the Cities some sick axes and began cutting the important trees
produce mango I got that Sasson Jackfruit trees and other sources of food some of the demons took firebrands and set fire to the residential quarters of the citizens my turn to come to the horrible thing is generally prohibited in particular trees that can produce this fruit for the maintenance of human society should not be cut in different countries there are different types of fruit trees in India the mango and the Jackfruit trees are prominent and other places there are mango trees Jackfruit trees coconut and Berry trees
 any tree that produces nice fruit for the maintenance of the people should not be cut at all
 it should just be proved this is for this is a shastra conjunction don't kill fruit bearing trees this Thursday
special beads
 I told you that did you know I once heard my group
 give a like it was like an old lecture like an old tape and he was talking about when they built the temple and the Christian Christian Barn Temple endowment and in that tree and small trees considered sacred to the about to Yogi site is the color of the tree itself and what about it and blackish and
 and Christian is blackish okay with that connection needs to answer when the gopis would see that tree when they're feeling separation from Christian bracelets in Mall Trina bracelet to Mom she feeling the deepest spiritual emotional brace in the tree
 and so he said his name was tomorrow Krishna goswami Holi was named his name had a connection with that tree and he thought when they cut down the tree they're going to cut down tree to build the temple
turn right on that plot of land when they cut down the children have beads made out of that wood from that small tree but then they didn't cut down the tree that they built the temple around the tree and that gives you an example show proper authority to hear what she's talkin about right trees are considered a sacred don't just casually cut them down like they want to cut down the tree though make a little indentation the wall and go around the tree you a little Bensel or sometimes they build those kind of benches around the trunk of the tree people can sit there take a shower relax so there is a higher awareness of the value of trees the sacredness of trees the sacredness of the life within the tree the Gratitude toward the tree is tree worship lot of Hindus do a lot of sugar and it's this right and so so we never got those beats
 yeah because their butt
that hit that I've heard that in a recorded lecture that he probably gave in the 80 sometime okay and now you never forget that you never forget state of my mind and then somewhere around 2,000 that tree died
 and I ain't your boo great fun on the great your turn on l r x yeah he he had a room that you lived in which was a very unique room it was like this like it was a spare some hermit to some has their own little Hut that they live in they do their deep meditation and it was like that half of his rooms and alter yeah branches of sticks and branches from it even like these long curly walking sticks yeah it was all
brother half was like a bed on the floor and recording equipment for yeah and he had to know all the walls are done with this cow dung style you know. And he would make designs out of it or kind of like gopis or like a big bee hives you make with lots of bees buzzing around things like that remember that even the whole floor like the entrance into that answers when you got to that part of the building had all this all these designs he was he was a sergeant was Dick yeah I heard that he had wood from that tree actually had like a major trunk lid right in the center of the room yeah I believe that and and I also heard they had other branches from it so I went to and I said you know I explained to him that tell him I got that the lecture that it heard and I heard that you have the wood and we brought it to the beat maker I said it would mean a lot to me
 if I could have some of that would offer you my Guru
competes and he agreed it readily agreed and she told me to soak soak it in Gigi soak the wood is soaking wet in there so I brought it to the to the beat maker yeah and he made a set of Beats beautiful set of beads and and I spoke to him and then I gave it to him on his last year's Pooja before he passed away in his last birthday Overcrest away and I wasn't there because I skiff I was about to get married the next day and I was I would love a set of beads from that tree if you ever get a chance again I don't know how to get another chance but so but when it was given he was a very difficult person to give a nice gift to driver like he trusts people hard to buy gifts for and he wouldn't shy away from saying this is not a good good
what are you thinking so but this this gift really broke whole new level of Grambling yeah I mean that was something that he probably didn't think anybody even knew he wanted cuz he spoke about a decade earlier you're good and there was that he got the set of beads that's why you're the good teacher cuz you were good but any case so then when he saw me he said that was a very thoughtful gift you know and he was really touched by it and I was really satisfied the first time I gave him a gift I really meant something
 and what he said but what's all this key you know and I said well and you told me to take so getting Gigi and then he and then so he said
 he said you should take these beads back and Chan on them until all the key goes away then give them back to me so he had chanted on them already
so he chatted on that side of bees and now I lost my mind Association beads long before that which was a heartbreaking thing yeah I was in the band Diamond template put them on the side as in a few times and came back there were gone I lost my initiation being stupid for doing that and I know if you get initiated into the gallery vaishnava lineage and you're given a set of Deeds by your group don't bring him out in public just leaving your house now see I don't take them anywhere that's that would be my advice I lost mine took away two and a half years to listen to so so I went four years without except for my crew and I wasn't about to go to him and ask him to channel another said okay so what happened so he he he chanted on them to get back to me and I was meant to channel them into any gave me some instructions on how I should meditate
 he said keep these beads
 in a sacred place and when and sometimes when you're when
very concentrated you can take them out and he instruct me how I should pray when I check in on these Greeks and and then and then and they said you're not getting these beads in my will I'll leave them to you and and so he he said buy it when you're when the all of these things off you can get back to me but she passed away before that happened that I'm dying before you is that I'm not assuming that bad when I die I'll give you the beads that means I would die before you do the math so so what happened so I got I got a set of Beats any chance tomorrow would that he particularly desired
Courtyard of the Crystal Ballroom Temple that she'll probably sat under that tree gave them to you just want to give you know I think my group be upset with me I think when giving things people appreciate things I don't think size matter fact I'm sure he would be upset if I came there before I died he thought they should probably burn them with my body is dry clean it anyway we're talkin about trees that was a squirrel that was a beautiful squirrel but we're going to call that is where the trees are the trees are sacred in India trees are sacred and so are squirrels sometimes 14
 are we just read Pick 16 thanks Mariners always on it and she always know the verse that's Disturbed again and again by unnatural occurrence is caused by the followers or any cashew Pooh all the people had to Cease the activities of data
kulture not receiving the results of yagya the demigods also became Disturbed okay so this was like
 like we are speaking about communist countries in the world like you cannot practice about to eat right like the different forces come down and they kind of lock it down who can do what you get caught doing this your dad that you got caught you in the shoe thrown out to labor can I have that still there in the win some places in the world today you know quite a few places in the world today so that's what it was like for these people now that the thesaurus came down they they made dharmik you know ritual and and so on practically legal they left a residential quarters in the Heavenly planets and unobserved by the demons began wandering on the planet Earth to see the design so that Dave is are coming down to earth seeing what's happening
 after performing the ritualistic observances or the death of his
brother Ronnie cashew Pooh being extremely unhappy try to pacify his nephews. Now this is interesting
 Renny koshy poo is going to begin to speak and text 20 but we're this next couple texts and we'll see he knew how to act according to the time and situation with sweet words he began pacifying his nephews whose names were sakuni sumbara Thrifty Boutique suntop Anna Ricker, knob and Mahan Ava and their mother is sister-in-law Rusev on it as well as his own mother DT he spoke to them so he's kind of the man of the year the patriarchy right yeah and
his brother just went down he's got to control his mother got to control his relatives and when he does so everything that's about to come out of his mouth even though he is directly opposed to Lord Vishnu everything is about to say has is made of Truth he's going to speak about the nature of the self how the soul is eternal how it transcends the body how do you know they know they know how the universe works too large to be they knew how to work but they just hated the center of it all yeah they understood the laws and how those laws works and they try to get around the lawn maker
 I tried to manipulate the laws so that they would work for their independence schemes your mother's sister-in-law and nephews did not lament for the death of a Great Hero for a great Hero's death his brother in front of his enemy is it is glorious and desirable
my dear Mother in a restaurant this isn't a lie I mean that's kind of a standard thing right everybody needs to eat or place for drinking cold water May Travelers are brought together and after drinking water they continue to the respective destinations similarly living entities join together in a family and later as a result of their own actions they are lead a part to their destinations my soul depressing but it's true that's an interesting way of looking at you all right yeah he used the analogy okay a bunch of people coming to a restaurant suddenly they're all in one room together we're all eating while drinking at a table together they brought us all together and then all the sudden don't meals over and he's saying that's what a family is like
Christmas everyone like moved out and everyone time they're alone they don't remember I've done for them and want you to check out the angry right now, but this is reality over here I got it for you quotes about of Akita cream on Ani
 the bewildered Soul under the influence of the three gounis material nature think himself the door of activities which are in actuality carried out by Nature that's when the third chapter I think I made this family is my family created the house the family I put it all together just coming together for a moment and then dispersing we think we can keep it together parents always like that all the families together is Holiday World
together we're actually just like it's just asking God it's just me and God here that's headed
 stoic recognized that's what it is
 all the living areas act exactly according to the directions of Thrifty material nature because of the material world we are probably under the high under a higher control all the living entities in this material world have come here only because they wanted to be equal to Krishna and enjoyment of dust been sent here to be conditioned by material nature different degrees very interesting and put it in the material world a so-called family is a combination of several persons in one home to fulfill the terms of their imprisonment interesting as a criminal prisoners scatter as soon as their terms are over right there to prison terms
okay free from prison they scatter scatter as soon as their terms are over and they are released all of us who temporarily assemble this family members will continue our respective destinations to our respective Nations started moving out then you have like a newer family that we only have five kids and then those other kids started moving out there eventually just me and my little brother aren't the only ones in the household and then you left and then I left and he leaves in the house that is sort of like that would seem so solid and permanent just like you're my first Transit until realizations as a child
 it was the last year 6th grade and I was going out to 7th grade the next year and was the last day of school and I knew I didn't go to the school now since kinder
and then I was going to graduate this school and go to the new bigger Junior High School 6th grade was the last year and so I remember was the last day of 6th grade I go
 that's it this chapter's over I will never come back to this place these people now we're going to become sort of scattered I'm going to get into a bigger circle of people from five different elementary schools are coming together and I was like my whole life is about to change whatever happened previously to the other day that chapters over I'm in my section 2 of life
 that must have been hard driving well it wasn't hard but it was just sort of like he wasn't quite Sarajevo hard but works in my chapters and what and you just very solid my whole life I was in the same school I could walk to school it was close to my family home and then that that's over now
I have to take a bus I'm going to give you with all these older older teenage kids with mustaches and you know bullies and it is and it was just like a whole another chapter in my life but I realize I okay that's over now is a whole another chapter and see when you're little and you're going through every year like they can think of all this is life is life is going to go on forever like this know how many kids have mustaches in your high school with cladding mustaches
 are we done by 27 are you can finish this reading this rather
 send air condition in the material world the so-called family is a combination of several personal leave is that the family members are like straws right not like drinking straws but like straw like grass carried together by the waves of a river sometimes of straws mixed together
in the whirlpools and later or dispersed Again by the same way it was alone in the water right push together make good on the river for a few metres then I get separated forever perhaps forever
 although her any cash if it was a demon he had Vedic knowledge and understanding that's the advice given to his family members his sister-in-law mother nephews was quite sound the demons are considered highly elevated in knowledge but because they do not use their good intelligence for the service of the Lord to call demons the demigods however our active very intelligently to satisfy the Supreme person out of God had this is confirmed in the Bog of a time as follows boom beard we just wasted or not, I'll be back I'm sitting here Heritage Festival
it is therefore concluded that the highest Perfection one can achieve I just charging prescribed duties, according to his caste divisions in order of life is to please the Lord to become a demigod or you become Godly whatever one's occupation one must satisfy the Supreme personality of that it
 that's it for the day we did it would valuable interesting goody nuggets do you have for us
 life is bigger than
 plantatree
 painted tree nut trees take a while
 find satisfaction through service
 I don't remember saying that but yeah we were at that was had to do with the tree from the very beginning planted the trees to my original tag or I was still think about trees and origin loving service towards the route to connect to all living entities
trees
 okay I'm close to Google in the face and don't cut down trees just build around them in even that just filled it out of that plastic excuse me
 we're Travellers sharing a drink and going our separate ways
 use your intelligence for the service of the Lord
