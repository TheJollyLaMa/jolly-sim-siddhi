the plexiglass that would melt butter type of some type of induction and deduction whatever it is I hate it and I've really never complained about anything but she complains about that stove but we're going outside now right in the magic garden by the way someone wrote you can't cook a roti on it I got news for you when I moved out of the Oscar on my way to my mom's house and master bacon chapati assemble wire coat hanger we will do it

 oh shut out to one of our Brotherhood what was backed up into its old name that's what I was married to Bobby and they had a baby and they also called The Baby by Borelli
another can I have another friend Oho congratulations one of our old school other / Zoomers
 it's baby month people are everyone's having babies okay here is the thing ready from St Augustine
 another one of the other there I got to take credit for this one to see this is another one that's like Saint Augustine it's been a tribute to him it's miniature to the John well Wesley
 this is what happens when I take a quote put it on my Instagram but I don't give credit for who quoted it so someone a quote me this book was my step for man one small step for man kind of others there's quite a few people that this one's been attributed to we were going to go to court and one in Augustine in August
okay
 in Essentials Unity Unity
 Liberty
 Liberty in all things
 love okay will you get out of that cuz stealing away from that and by the way I have the Latin here
 we can skip the line I don't know you're the big language guy, not just people out there I'm in England would be the word nerd
 and necessaries Unitas remember Johnny Unitas no
 you weren't interested in football in your kid
 he's like what a great quarterback of the Green Bay Packers or something no that was Bart Starr Unitas was like how old are you
it necessary to Unitus in doobies libertad libertas
 an Omnibus
 chartis sometimes it's translators charity charity in charity but you know I looked it up the word charity
 and found that the archaic you know definition of
 well it says the third definition I found of Charity was kindness and tolerance in judging others and then it said the archaic when his love of humankind typically in the Christian context
 so I like the translation in Essentials Unity are so what does that mean non-essentials Liberty I think this is especially this formula so it would share this idea with shared was handed down
 as an aid in Christian communities to get along with each other like
there's always going to be differences right sure but let's be United essential things let's find out what essential
 and then do these other things that are not essential that we tend
 to perhaps give too much attention to
 in the non-essentials Liberty will you know where the things that are less essential
 do what you want to do in the things had a really essential let's all get on board with it let's all get on the same page with that it is things that are less essential
 let's not get all you know what's the word I'm looking for like a ornery about that or let's not get too concerned with the in Essentials they're not so important but in all things whether whether it's like finding our unity and essential things or are liberality in the non-essential things the motive behind it that the mood behind it should always be loved right sorry Tusk Terrace Oswego you know it's sad that this wasn't turn
know that dumb
 I know that boxing no talk or use this term I don't know if he coined it I just don't know of anyone that used to before him but he uses turn the sort of girl who voiced never had sort of a sort of means he has since engrossing means one who accepts where they will accept the essence or you could say we seek the essence right this is kind of what can take one from the level of religion to spirituality from superficial spirituality to like real deep spirituality is I'm looking for the essence of something like even you and I were just talking right before the show like there was someone
 that that has an interest in Baki
 but has a lot of what let's put it aside let's not talk about any individual but within even within mg please
but but even like say within School in in the in our modern-day communities about the yoga some people are really concerned about the way you dress and some people are like it's not so say some people say you really need to dress like like that your so-called traditional Indian ways really important part of this brat and other people say actually is that insistent that is holding everything down the people in the Western World can relate to because you're wearing these clothes
 in either case that's a non-essential non-essential the siletz have Liberty you know what if you want to do this way go 45 do it that way that's okay too good analogy could have been okay yeah that's how we feel like whatever you want is that it's a non-issue to non-essential but but in a central thing would be less princess how you relate to other box of Yogi right like another tree down did the respect that you need to show all human
what is speak of those at that are that are also practicing bhakti yoga that's an essential aspect of our of our of our practice you know sometimes we get caught up in the nonessentials and we fight over them and we Overlook the essential like how we treat one another you know it's not so sensual how we dress it's it is essential that we treat one how we respect one out and all things love right so whether it's and that's just one example now the box with time itself the whole thing is kind of despoiling things down to the essence you know in several places but in Bob Thomas it's like it's called by what time is called the survey don't be shut down she would bark town is potato at that time is of the essence of all the Vedas Sora verus they don't the sudden write it if you boil it down and boil out the in Essentials
you boil the right down to the bar with how much is the essential part of all of y'all Satish teachings and in there even like in the past and that we're eating now
 you know you could say from certent Vedic perspectives
 you can look at Pearl and say he's born in the family of the Demons like that you know this tells us a lot about who he is a lot about his character you no excetera excetera excetera he comes from a bad family and parentage their details I say gender roles sure there's I would argue that there's certain truth and Generals cuz there's certain differences in the psychology between men and women but it's not essential
 it is so it doesn't speak to the essence and Bob time is coming to help us understand the essence a lot of time just turning Lisa
a downright coladas a child generally get wisdom from the elders that's a detail the essence is the wisdom itself and whoever's got it we honor them
 so Perla become so honored even though he's from the demoniac family even though he's a child because he embodies the essence he is glorified you know love it and that goes on and in many different in so many different. It's so clearly laid out in that Pastime where the wives of the brahmas you know in the tent cancer which we spoke about many times but where the maybe you could just breathe very pleased to share what happens there
 if you want to if you don't watch it with the wives of Brown's yeah I was going to go to this whole other thing but that's okay but the wives of the brahmins is
Richmond Ballroom in the Calvert boys they're playing their dirty that dirty little kids there didn't dirty little kids in dirty little doty's and here is our very big religious function happening with all these erudite pundits Scholars doing a fire Young Kia and there is chanting mantras and I have to chant them with Precision articulation for The Munsters to have its efficacy and you know whenever they have one of these. Just a fruit around the fires that they end up at the end putting into it either make offerings right there yeah I sent in and so are you picturing the proved it is is when you when you said it a fire using a look at that fruit at 4 I'm going to get that papaya boiling the yard yet but anyway so all these fruits are there and in the Cowboys see it and Christmas season and Kristen said we weren't playing so hard
 that's those glass slippers.
to see if they'll give you some some of that Christian Butler armor hungry I sent you the details on you like start adding Falls details please go get some of that fruit so they went bunch of little boys went up excuse me sir they're all chanting these mantras immaculate
 clean ritual going on here come the dirty little little talk about how they got dirt in there. He's on their knees that's what these boys do and it come to this very pristine religious function and they
ideally they were out of here are your parents that you know exactly what they did their own didn't even say any of that they just thought that in their mind they just totally ignored them which is even worse than getting chest cold
 and so they came back to Krishna balaram so disheartened Krishna balaram couldn't serve you that they wouldn't even take give us any attention as if we are nothing and then krisha said you know what I expected that would happen but they're wise the simple ladies over there go knock on their cottage door and see if they'll give some food for Christian ball around and they knocked on the door and immediately the lady
 Sometimes women has holding a baby just what a woman holding a baby and Anna details again okay
Ben's your back over and sometimes you have two babies ever see women with two babies as I've seen it is at 3 at the same time they say that you carry the child for nine months in the womb and then for three years after and feed the baby if you don't do your Mother's Day feed the child with her hand is a squirrel but it's very interesting I'm at these Indians in India in I'm going to go on the Indian on the show I want to hear from you on the message board but I went to this one Indian boy Gujarati when I was in England I said did your mother hand feed you cuz you're not even his mother feeds in the mouth and I said to I said to the boys I said did your mother hand feed you he said yeah he said yeah I said how many years he was like.
three years I said three years huh hey I'm fat no Forks cuz he had 3 years I went and I met the mother and I said you don't understand this pain between the Indian mother and the Indian Child is such a deep deep on that we don't even have it America and I said you hand fed your son for three years and she goes oh no 10 years and he says yes it's a thing and fed she is shastri is unzoom she can you also say how many years you were hand-fed please share with us is very curious and are you hand feeding your little baby I see you think she's breastfeeding right now probably she said not me all maybe it's a boy thing not me but my husband was fed until he was ten ten
 it's not me I think she is Shashi to coming into Indian consultant you are new Indian consultant shastri want you to know that okay so okay so anyway as soon as
I just beating them both of their hands and then Christian the coward was knocked on the door and said Krishna balram are hungry that's all she wants those kids kick those two little kids aside Hungry Hungry Birds going through the refrigerator going through all the thing going to the freezer looking for things to make
 what she could say whip up smoothies various things in the kitchen what could it be a Christian bottom so the idea was that all they needed to hear was an inkling that Christian bomber hungry and they dropped everything to go right to the seneschal in a y hours
 cuz they understood the essence because I was going to say it because they had heard about Krishna and through hearing about Krishna that fall in love with them will that's what we're trying to do right now as we're trying to do right now
therefore the husbands who are the great religious people the one who escaped and call me there if the husband who worthy the leaders the priest the learn and Arrow Diner with all the cars up on Dale's night all the details and do all the new all the details but they missed the essence and then they lamented they lamented oh to hell with all our ritual the hell with my appropriate pronunciation
 the hell
 what is the essence of portalets it when are they fed Christian are they they gave their hearts to him Christian Express his appreciation there's a whole loving exchange that took place but yeah there's no ball around with their hands but let's give credit to the Brown
is the self the husband because although of here I got the right there yeah yeah beautiful you I dragged that message board over towards the camera so I don't need to come look in your eyes
 so sad but the husband's they realized the irony the the irony and and kind of like the I don't know just how sad and a sense it was that although they had studied so much scripture although they had been trained and performed by Sarah T's and memorized all for what purpose to bring themselves closer to God that when God came to them they ignore him because they're all caught up in the in Essentials whereas the wives they weren't trained in all those in a sentence
but they understood the essentials and so then the husband said to hell with all of our learning and all of our munchos and all of this and all that our pride that we developed out of this we lost the essence of Pride doesn't necessarily come in beauty or fame or wealth you can also come in your learning even your spiritual education even worth in that realm not really even though almost like it happens in every spiritual or religious tradition in it and it a lot of times this is exactly what turns people off to quote on quote religion right is that people emphasize in essential things rather than the essential things like in other words might let say what whatever religious but let's say Christian and you and I grew up in that the people are coming in there they're all kind of forcing a certain type of morality or certain type of detailed kind of morality on people and people just have this whole thing's turn me off and they're not
sing any of the essence the loving Essence that is what Jesus was really teaching so we accept the detail things to the extent that they helped us get to the essence if they're not helping us get to the essence we can drop him like a hot potato drop it right but it and if they're helping us get to the SSN we embrace them you know it will will will embrace all the detailed information all the different regulations or it could be rituals whatever it is if it's moving us towards that the essence which is love
 we embrace it if but if it it but but the wiser person of the the secret yes if they can recognize right now the detail which is part of the tradition is not serving the purpose of going to the essence is a matter of fact it seems to be working against that then we'll drop it will applied where it's working towards the essence will drop it when it's not I think we especially have to be careful because we have such a deep
I want to say intricate but very detailed detailed culture from the way we dress from the markings on the body from The Munsters which ran from the rituals we do and the incense in the order of which one is to speak of varnish from Dharma right like like a whole lifestyle of how your men to carry out your occupation and yeah and nnn is very easily I mean if your if your new listening to this but you've ever visited a Harry Krishna Temple in the west you going to the gift shop and you can just like wow look at this look at this outfit look at this jewelry and look at this dog look at his children's book and look at this DVD tray and look at these deities you could be so lost it and you just start on going to purchase this one approaches to purchase my spiritual identity and I'm not saying the bad way we we want to feel like this is our tribe this is what we do this is essential
sometimes with all these details we can step right out of the essence and the essential details in bacta is Channing the holy name and not finding fault with other people those are about 1 so if you got to stop criticizing people and you got a chance of holding a With all sincerity calling God into your life yeah it's the details aren't helping you do that they're not working for you
 is it that she was a diversion in the same way will you know if it's something you're doing is diverting taking on a detour and something to be careful with detours because sometimes they're not you know pastimes they're like Pathways to the whole different universe that can just leave you astray hasn't come back never comes back yeah but you can also get lost in these Vedic details that don't have much to do with the essential teachings
this is what I love more than anything about our lineage it really emphasizes details and besides yeah you know I'm a little crooked today big deal when you put on the T lock any chance of the month or were you meditating on the Montreux any place that there were you stalling a little ride on the part of your life protect my forehead yes I did I took the child that I'm singing artist that you have done offered to my Lord oh my God my lords remnants sometimes all you can say but talking about like like like a
all right okay since everyone today's Sanskrit term for everyone saudagara he he he listening to a show right now on Zoom except the essence cts's

 one by one the different Universal kind of Representatives or Stephen up and they all are offering a prayer in a sense through the lens and how they see the world yeah it's nice it's different species of higher beings you know what I mean but there's some people in this world that are deaf
play from a higher realm they do more with their life they think they're their brains can just think before you do I have a problem just making my bed you know just get waked up making my bed every day that's it that's like that I got to really concentrate on that there's people that like multiple businesses going on a higher intelligence and I don't think they're better than me for that but I just do think there's different levels of human species for the Bible talks about will look I'm talking about like a real Next Level IRB they might be in the form of a bird in the might sometimes they're in the form of talking birds and I've never seen one doesn't mean one can exist he would love to see when they wouldn't get talking bird

eBay since he's out there Lotus feet in the street by Bob with Tom Canto 7 chapter 8

 but let's hear what the bird people have to say Okay the inhabitants of b l V8 Ali colloca I don't think those are the bird people do you know how to find anything on it but I did look it up or you're off the hook if that's what you're saying when a holiday
 did you look it up
did you take her to a ronika cyclopedia a second descending from the earth region from batalha a lot of his brothers have their city as soon as I know no one knows this guy he's trying okay but not the people yeah even Parvati reside there she say
 where in the store is there right now
 interesting demons as well they're under the name okay and Arenas of sacrifice we were accustomed to great we were accustomed to great respect from everyone
 this demon however usurp that position now to our great Fortune you have killed this great demon
actually has one cures a chronic disease and someone's got a chronic disease and all the sudden they're cuter than must be like oh my God you've given me life again so if I said who is just squashing their rituals you know it's so interesting it so that just how they express ourselves right because we were chatting your spotless glories
 ingrate assemblies in arenas a sacrifice I can get in public in the public Arena we were accustomed to great respect from everyone
 like
 in one sense they're saying because we're connected to you we received a lot of respect in society we were seeing his high-level people sure and then
 and then her any cash poop kind of ruins that whole thing and thank you
restoring everything back to the way it was it's it's a glorification
 of Vishnu
 but it's not that of the purevolume I'm not making any judgments on the bird people these aren't people there speak and other people are coming out of the box have again cuz it's always speaking to the essence of showing us that they were moving towards yes but they hadn't boil it down to the full license yet because that's how the way for lies going okay. Another one
 now the bird people to canaras the kanara said those Supreme controller we are ever existing Servants of your lordship but instead of rendering service to you we were engaged by this demon in his service constantly and without renumeration when it connected for
play tight like maybe with where they getting something financially from the Lord
 you are ever existing Servants of your lordship but instead of rendering a service to you we were engaged by this demon in his service and constantly and without any remuneration this simple man has now been killed by you therefore oh Lord to string a Dave our Master we offer a respectable obeisances unto you please continue to be our patreon member sign up for a patreon account my lover's part Patron
 okay that was the bird people whose bird people they have their own police it was with sages.com patreon for a day and now we're going to the last verse it actually is going to go to people on a whole different level of spiritual awareness we're going to hear from residents if I quit the who apparently came.
into the material around to witness this event I understand everybody looks like Lord Vishnu in by Kunta yeah so that we can picture them as four-armed kind of bluish skinned
 crown jewels all the beautiful personalities to details that you can know that these aren't load Misha
 take us to Belgium nice little silvery talkative of swirl of a haircut of thing on the chest where the Lakshmi resides it's almost like trying to find the queen bee in a hive if you know what I mean it's like they all of this
 does one of them that's that's Center this whole thing here right by all look the same but you look close
is bigger
 okay and they usually mark them like that the people who will they put a put a little like a little Mark on them so you can tell them put their little bigger than the other piece what do the associates of Lord Vishnu and vaikunta have to say will they say this the associates of Lord Vishnu by current offer this prayer oh Lord our Supreme give her a shelter today we have seen your wonderful form is Lourdes string a Dave Meant For the Good Fortune of the world the lord we can understand that to run your cashew Pooh was the same Jaya who engaged in your service but was cursed by the brahmins and who Dost received the body of a demon
 we understand that his having now been killed we understand that his having now been killed is your special mercy upon him it was pretty amazing plastic demon even of this material world like her any cash
I mean her any cash you pull according to all these other even very exalted beings even the bird beings you know what the speak of like learning humans humanoids be called them they just met this guy is great demon he's he's ruining everything but the vaikunta people actually saw the backstory
 they saw the Baxter-Birney koshy Putin said it was great to voting and he was cursed we don't even know that if these if there's great demons on Earth if they're actually demon or if they're taking some roll just to stir stuff up out of our control and all we have to do is see how are we going to react to this and we act with with personal Integrity with devotion or we going to get overwhelmed with hate
 look up whole pot
 Pol Pot yeah who knows I'm just the things he did were demonic
it always comes back to Pol Pot doesn't have another again another pair we hear here we hear another person there's another perspective this is the perspective of people without any without the burden of the mind without the burden of the programming of the material might show her these are ready and so they're not caught yet like they're not caught up in the friends and enemies like we had an enemy you just killed him thank you for restoring everything the way it was before they don't think I'm that love what they see when they see a run across who kill killed by loader showing a what they see look at how Lord Vishnu just gave Mercy
 look at how we benefited him look at how even though he was so demoniac
everything that he does is a benediction they could say they're seeing what others aren't seeing
 you know
 and so is there with a mind unburdened by material considerations of material attachments they're able to see the glory of Lord Vishnu and the way that the bird people didn't say
 and they can fly to so they got it all ends
 Schumann Vaga Tom Cantor 7 chapter 8 lord of rings a slave the king of the demons that was a long time with that chapter and I think we missed been a long time for the next 12 is a lot of fascinating information and it shall We Begin it let's do it the next chapter and it's entitled chapter 9 chapter 9 prolonged pacifier is Lord

bring you closer to God right you could have anger at the devotees are getting punished hurt and I'm furious about it that type of anger brings you closer to God righteous whereas someone cut me off I was this guy can't drive that's another try unless you have a devotee in the car with you and you felt that their life was being threatened yeah then even road rage
 enters the level of spiritual domain you're justifying everything I know it's truth but these emotions that seem dark when they're connected with Lord Vishnu and they bring us closer to God they have yet our our anger is the Warped reflection of it right is Warped by our self esteem by are there away so they're all standing there like two hot or it wasn't
