well we wish them love they're in Transit Avenue Vermont right now and no gauge to the bright light of Vermont it's like
 what can you say what can I say
 a good couple arrested like you want to do is think in the you should punish a child you have to pray please remove your glaring a falchion so that I can see your face and see your face on a marriage I can't hear you
 here we go this is for Marcus Aurelius or nugget for the day I love this Marcus Aurelius Roman a stoic philosopher I like a lot the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts at this really resonates with me there for guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no Notions unsuitable to virtue
and reasonable nature unsuitable for to Virtue and reasonable nature I love this yeah that is sort of our whole Quest I think I'm going to share how I deal with that you want to start yeah I mentioned a couple things I'm going to ask you some questions house that's a sure so I mean first of all I like you know, you people save all your happiness depends on blank
 and generally it a point to external things but I like that he goes to the internal thing that happened in Sri Lanka depends on the quality of your thoughts I think we live in a day and age where we've become captivated by external things and distractions and it would do us a whole lot of good if
he said if if we were raised I think we got to start raising people like this sure like in schools and stuff always say hey we got to think about the quality of our thoughts that's what they do and and how how can we improve the quality of our thoughts to imagine if everyone were thinking higher-level thoughts you know and and what does it take to get there so I thought of three ways that a spot to Yogi's we address to Quality birth thoughts and I want to ask you robbing us how on The Daily you work towards improving your thoughts in these ways so that cuz I know that you're a serious talk to yoga practitioner so here's a few things content that we can swim in the mind that's going to factor I thought for sure
 rituals that we used to direct the mind
 okay and also meditations different things that we meditate so in your daily
let's start with contact consumed in the mind how how does how do you like it like that I think I personally really work on one one key thing I do is I make sure I'm at peace with everybody in my mind like I Harbor hope I work really hard not to hate and not to resent and although that sounds like big deal everybody that's at now people don't do that people sometimes people look to be hurt they look to be offended or even had a situation recently where
 there was some misunderstanding with someone and you know I apologize say I'm sorry that might be a misunderstanding or they wanted me to do something on a particular day that I couldn't do it and I was a misunderstanding and the person wanted to not accept the apology they want to be sore like a Tony Soprano you like once you cross me it's over something like that you know and in the problem is there's like an
yeah there's like an ego associated with these archetypes that we want to be like without you it's it's not even the victim is sort of like you want to be like this archetype this mafia boss who there is no forgiveness it's just it's over and it's the one that that strength like that type of strike I'll teach him that you know you're out of my life you mean nothing to me gently with someone says you mean nothing to me you mean a lot to them and you feel like you're under their skin if you really meant nothing you let it go to the so one thing I really think is important is you let stuff go on a regular basis you clear if you clear your head and your heart of resentment of Anger of bitterness and work on being happy when somebody walks into the room instead of being like I can't believe they're here
 and I do find that once I feel like I'm good at this the universe always sends me some
are there other situation that I got to work on so I think yeah I think it's that is an ongoing practice and I think you get better at it and it makes them on Peaceful
 pregnant so that's water quality thoughts better quality thoughts and then another thing is like we do what would we do in six pillars is we don't criticize and the converse is we see the good in others so we're not sure if you started get what you're looking for if I if I'm looking at an aquarium until cuz to find the redfish you'll be looking for that red fish so you know or if you're a gold in the red car experiment aren't you
 you know about that yeah I bet you that you write you but you shall look for the red car you find every car that's rad right see you later other words if you just talked to someone on an average day just say how many red cards did you see on your way here they're going to have absolutely no idea
 but if you say so I'm not going to give you $20 tomorrow for every red car that you see then they're going to
either going to see after looking right car exactly how people are so people are looking for certain things in this world sometimes you looking for sex or for money or four different types of flavors of fun whenever they consider fun you know where sports or they're getting their egos stroked or their into some type of hobby but if you're looking
 the problems with other people to enforce your ego experiment that relates to this I think we mentioned it once on the show before
 what but they had this experiment where they had people they're doing a test where people were supposed to go and
 and submit the resumes and apply for jobs
 before they went they painted a scar on their face like a really realistic Scar and then they showed in the scar in the mirror and they could see it
 and so they were going there
now with his pain is gone the face but right as they're about to walk out the door so let us just touch up that scar a little bit and then they would actually race this car
 and then they would go and apply for the job and then come back and Report how it went and it was very common that the people were reporting oh yeah they were looking right at my scar and they were judging me based on this car and did that you know they're rejecting me because of this car but there was no car there and so yeah you know our minds do play these games where we
 see see ourselves as victims or see ourselves as being mistreated or when actually not even happening
 yeah and yeah I know I was thinking of just that the nature of our own personal insecurities which comes from an ovarian cyst you know filters that we wear from her past relationships or broken past relationships will see the world where the owner
I can feel solid about myself is if I see problems in other people so I go out in the world to find fault with people and if I can find enough fault in them then it makes me feel a whole or make me feel better so that's a problematic thinking and it never keeps my mind at peace that's one of the that's one of the things I'm going to be another thing that goes with that is lewd conversation lewd conversation lewd conversation with the mind is always addicted to sexual thoughts that sexual talk it keeps them what it what both those things does is it keeps them it keeps the Consciousness in body Consciousness you have a society based on bodies judging body sizing a bodies and to keep you on a very very external platform and as you know is about the time I say of friends or enemies do people be like people who don't dislike it keeps us out of spiritual vision so the back what time is with the Bible time teacher
this really had actually have a peaceful mind that's one of the symptoms of being God conscious of my just becomes peaceful but it has to go to this subtle level see people as Spiritual Beings people see people as beings instead of just things are objects of that we like or dislike so that's one way and that's the way in and we work at it when we working out of just presently just by reading the bog of time everyday that's one of those are horrible things that I use and also training yourself to see good in people and appreciating people and finding a people's good qualities that's a different directive but it's a different you searching for gold instead of looking for iron
 all right you ignored my questions though
 no it wasn't that I wanted you to answer my question okay that was your first question right or rituals
the spiritual rituals the spiritual rituals
 I'm asking about guy who invented life asking for a general thing
 it's okay that will this is part of our spiritual practice chanting is a ritual we used to direct the mind it's it's actually the Mantra is to check ryu's that Morrison meditation but okay you know all these things all three of these things lap over with each other but I didn't Montrose hold the mind the worship of the DD this to hold the Mind these rituals but they're to hold the mind in place and so the meditation is now in God and God's form and then are singing This is used to hold the Mind practically speaking everything would doing yoga is to hold the mind on that form of God and so our whole life is to try to get our minds back and and not have it sneaked away wherever the mind wanders due to its unsteady and flicker nature one was catch it and bring it back
are you the control the South but the 6 chapter the Gita and that's what we're doing with everything that we do whether it's kirtan whether it's Pooja Weather Channel the holy name or whether we were reading and imbibing this stuff or if her mind is other places so those are rituals which the third one probably meditations
 well interesting Lee enough if the mind is clean but you probably want me to say like what will you remember how are you chanting japa but I'm not going to say that cuz you I'm not going to give you what you want I really thought that too and said well that's meditation now I think meditation I think things like money sex food intoxicants you know whatever these can be meditations for people you know are there medications that you do to improve the quality
your thoughts
 he froze out on me
 hey are you okay people come back every show is is a challenge but you know I was when I was thinking about running as mentions you know rituals direct the mind and him he mentioned you know the rituals that we do in the temple like the DD worship
 and I was I was just thinking about this today is that I think it's coming from people that are not coming from an Eastern Traditions people are coming from Western Traditions judeo Christian or Islamic Traditions when they see a temple
 it must be very difficult to understand what's going on and it must seem like a primitive act wherein people Cinco this piece of wood or the stone is God and if we don't appease the
God and bad things will happen to us
 you know people there may be some people that actually approach it that way but really what it has to do with is is this improving the quality of your thoughts and otherwise the ideas that
 by seeing the form and by performing ritual that is meant to that wreck the mind in a particular direction is it's really all about cultivating a mood of selflessness cultivating a mood of devotion cultivating a mood of kindness cultivating a mood of seeing people equally elevator in the mood of seeing God in everyone it's really about directing the Mind through ritual to higher levels of thought and so really if you look at my what is a temple a temple is like a place where the people are supposed to come and spend a little time of every day to uplift their thoughts so that when you
while you're in there your thoughts are on a very high level and when you walk out of there your thoughts remain higher and by doing that everyday actually begin to develop these at the thoughts of a person who embodies kindness the thoughts of a person who has Peace of Mind in other thoughts of a person who can see God in every living being and so I'd like Marcus Aurelius has approach to finding happiness that he's saying has to do with the quality of your thoughts and I love how the old traditions in it's best she has about teacher edition walk to yoga tradition has so many so many well-designed meditations so many well-designed rituals that that are provided as practical ways to improve the quality of our thought
 and so that's what I was taking from that
I'm hoping recognizes going to pop in any minute but honestly it's very difficult to say I go ahead and get assessed started with our opening shlokas hoping Montrose every chance on the road even sort of swept in the awesome bag with time which is the very means of Conquest when should offer respectful obeisance is under the person of the Garden on to Nara nor I nor is she the super most human being ever go see what being the author wants her last appraised for Barbara Sue Mitcham back to you tomorrow okay back there baby can I sticky but regular tennis classes in the Bog of Tom and the render a service to the pier to vote is all that is troublesome
heart will become a Raticate in and let me service to the Supreme Lord whose Praises Transit of the songs will be established as in a revocable fact will magana to let on this sad Jana Jana shalabiya scheudle me to tell me another space we go to bed I was born in the darkness of ignorance in the teachers in my life have been opening my eyes at the door side of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their world of speed
 yeah let's see what it the same thing cuz scuba all that is troublesome to the heart will become a Raticate it that's what happens in bhakti yoga the heart we mean the mind is now at peace the minds of Peace when the mines at peace then you can then you can start to connect with the soul
 otherwise the soldiers gets covered over everything that was Julius about peace of mind but then inbox you just take it to the next level I'm sorry I missed you or inside story and your magic formula and recipes for how to deal with the mind but we had a blackout here at the Sun
the cafe and we're back we're back you were ready to get a shin upon a time I thought I'd just let me know.
 Go ahead
 read who should my body bag with Tom Canto 7 chapter 4 text 35
 yeah I was thinking that we might be due for a bit of a recap and Wild
 you okay there right now
 yeah used to recapture just try to get them to turn the music down we can't hear you have to do to keep it podcast going okay it's so loud right now so in chapter one you know we started the 7th can't though I think we started it at the unit towards the beginning of January so we're about a little over a month in any chapter 1 the question of ensuring Bob tomorrow lunch break it is asking sugar labels
is Krishna partial right it seems like cuz from the previous canto
 we saw you don't seem like he's favoring the day was over the Azores right and yes it is God partial doesn't play favorites
 it should be able swap meet spoke about
 he this interesting idea that even the asuras even when they're killed even when they're killed by Krishna
 due to their absorption in him
 they receive liberation
 answer this this was shown to a conversation between Narda and can you just here at the register you sacrifice just after Krishna killed the demon oxygen-poor and everyone saw the soul of such people enter into the body of Krishna so then darted you know following that thread nardis spoke about how to rent a car cheap
how John Vijay The Gatekeepers vaikunta were cursed by the four Kumaris he's grade boys sages have to take birth in the material world 3 X in the families of the Soros family of the demons and among them is hiranyakashipu
 and you wished you was asked about how is it that you run your car shampoo this Universal powerful demon had such animosity for his son provide cuz Charlie father's you know they held their kids and let their kids they're sympathetic to the kids and so chapter 2 began with her Renny koshy Pooh speaking to his relatives
 about not lamenting
 about the death of his brother who was killed by Lord Vishnu and in telling in his speaking to his relatives he share the story
how y'all Mirage the god of death took the form of a young boy and went right up to the wives of King suyog know who just been killed on the battlefield in Spoke such clear you know at maguana knowledge of the nature of himself our Eternal in Taiwan
 and in chapter 3 we had to run your car should be doing severe austerities to receive Boons from Lorimar essentially he thought were essentially making him immortal
 and we saw how he took over then Universe he's tormenting the day of us and everyone else
 and it was mentioned
 that although he had everything he still was dissatisfied because his senses run uncontrolled right
 so what's her education who tormenting everyone the Dave is approached Lord Vishnu in Lord Vishnu Shores them
 I want to run across Caputo
his son provide the pure devotee that will put it into her on your coochie poo and that brings us pretty much up to where are now just what we began to hear is now the description of Sri Prasad who is he what are his qualities and so this chapter kind of where where we started where we ended before and in the rest of it really has to do with the the qualities of provide we heard and text 31 and 32 that his senses were perfectly controlled his mind was perfectly at peace he was very kind is very respectful he gave shelter to others he has very deep friendships and he was free for my pride even though we had so many
 wonderful qualities and so we're kind of picking up after that right now I will text you later on today 2:35
in any assembly where there are discourses about Saints and devotees okay unisteer even the enemies of the Demons name of the demigods with the speak of you with Skype prologue Maharaj as an example of a great devotee who is the innumerable Transit the qualities of prolonged Mirage he had unflinching faith in Buster Dave & Buster Buster Dave and unavoidable ocean to him
 his attachment to Lord Krishna was natural because of his previous devotional service although his good qualities cannot be enumerated they prove that he was a great Soul Mahatma text 37 from the very beginning of his childhood prolonged Mirage was uninterested in childish playthings indeed he gave them up all together remain silent and all being fully absorbed in Krishna Consciousness since his mind was always affected by Krishna conscious
you cannot understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification
 Charlotte Mirage with this thumb
 this is an interesting person and interesting commentary but she'll probably but you know I think you will find this interesting
 emergency that his mind
 he was fully absorbed in Krishna Consciousness since his mind was always affected by Krishna consciousness
 and the other the language that used to describe that his mind always being affected by Krishna Consciousness the term use here's Krishna graha Griffith hot mama
 krishnaraja what is Gras mean
 planet yeah Planet surprise myself
it's actually the definition of Gras
 is in the in the Sanskrit dictionary says seizing laying hold of her holding
 or it can be used to describe it to refer to a planet because in Vedic astrology sign instead of the planets have the seasoning or influence you know they sees us where they influence our destiny in a supernatural manner so when it says Krishna Krishna Gras means his mind was it was being influenced by Krishna Krishna was in his life like this planetary influence and grit in and Greta at Mommy's whose mind was fully attracted so I thought a lot about this actually you know because you know what planets that you know they have their own accord if your I believe in astrology and it's a fascinating science you know people will you
we're not talking about like when you and I were growing up you know I suppose it's a lady sitting at a window with like a bandana crystal ball or I was just thinking of you get the newspaper and everyday would have like a little oh yeah you know astrological thing that really had it was almost like it had had about the accuracy in the the sophistication of like a fortune cookie fortune cookies were really do believe worksheet
 a good friend in my life who was suffering in
 their moon was in rahu and they couldn't understand why they were so depressed and then went to astrologer and see how you got the moon and rahu of course you got to be depressed it's going to last for a while because the moon and rahu or enemies and going to go on till this day and then it's going to it's going to relieve you but sometimes you think there's some external they have
but it's actually he's our Celestial things that are happening within and call them within the body or you can give him we give them so tight we give them names of things we can understand where you at you got a chemical imbalance but there's higher forces that work with us and work against us in the same way the moon affects the tides of the ocean the moon affects a woman's menstrual cycle of the moon affects the mind so these other planets are also affecting us a deeper way
 that sometimes they seem like this seems so far-fetched but it's true and so as you're saying like sometimes someone's gone through just a difficult period in life and it seems like no matter what they try to do they just can't shake it it's like I got this Cloud hanging over me you know and and as you're saying that you know a good astrologer some that actually knows how to do and can identify the reasons why that might be and they can also even identify when it's going to ease up you know but you know to understand
how how to apply this astrology prickly for a box of Yogi you know it's not it's not that we get too caught up in a but we might
 we might consult it in a way
 but sometimes their influences are a life that we can't like you can't change
 the moment that you were born in the place that you're born so the stars that you were born under and that and that's going to play out in your life in a particular way and that's something that you can't change
 sometimes like let's say now another interesting Vedic Sciences bus to write which is you know it's the same kind of thing like an astrologer would study the science of space and house using a particularly in architecture right and see if you see that thing I posted on my Instagram stories with at Revenge from Temple and every different time the sun goes through
son goes to the different holes in a pyramid-shaped temple throughout the course of the day amazing yeah yeah was quite a bit was quite amazing yeah you can tell they were greatest you know they were great astrologer see no going back yuno many many many many sensor on a yes and Australian world strongest Rogers and astrologers and so we can't we when you when you design a building the way that's in the me to call today to design a building would be Consulting his boss to and they have this the bus to Perugia was it called of us to Peru to push
 you're the best approach but that that that kind of the diagram that they make what is it called the bus to purusha I think this was called the bastard purush cannot be in the Northeast
 but your kitchen cannot be facing
I think that's what it is or they'll be firing the household you'll always be fighting in the household they have different picture picture of grid Square Grill and the proof she means the person so it's the bus to person and he's in this position like
 picture someone with they're squatting with her hands like you know like prayer like in a position of against her chest
 and there and his head is leaning into the northeastern corner of that grid and his toes you know his palms are his legs are bent in his soles of his feet are together and pointing towards those I got to look up last year's trapped in a little box then yeah and and and so then all around that and each one of the squares on the on the outer edges of that grid
 the different day Bazaar
and so there's a whole science of like according to the different Davis what you place in your home like you're saying the kitchen should be in a certain area the bathrooms are being a certain area the bedroom that all of that is only in your house according to it right deal you're building your house now days we find it anywhere, I'll take it you know or we move it to a Housing Development it's not like those guys were building Levittown Long Island are using vastu to build their houses they're saying okay here's our land we're going to set up the house is like this and he was going to be the little Woody call the turnaround
 what they call us
 call the cul-de-sac cul-de-sac yeah it's just like they're just in and out in a grid however they can many houses they can shove in there but anytime there's a great piece of architecture actually throughout the world be at the pyramids or the the pyramids from Central America or
they're all done with the celestial bodies in mines and so as you're saying we may not have have the the luxury of the privileged user the ability to have a house is designed according built according to vastu other certain things about that house we won't be able to change but there are ways to bring an influence is that you can customize right so Frances well I was thinking princess like if your home like let's say your home isn't designed according to but what you can do is you can play deandra's right and your answers are like these it is almost like placing planets in your home you know but you can choose where you were out with them you know it's a whole thing people to get into this thing to the craziest things with their houses have you ever done anything like that
 what I once had a good. Harper will stay in my home so he's just here and he was really into the science of us or so
play me some youngsters and tell me where to place them I really did you like lift the table up off the floor a little bit to give her some people do that too that's a whole thing but here's the point is the idea there's certain things that we can't change we can't change the time and the place that we were born you might not be able to change your house but you can you can play C on chores in your house in different places and you might not be able to change the time that you're born you might not be able to change certain astrological influences in your life but what you can do is you can make Krishna that Krishna graha in your life right Krishna planet yes yeah like in other words this was this was prolonged mirages life is that he was Krishna grogger he thought that he was being influenced by this by this Krishna Gras it was like it was like one big huge auspicious planet that his life was centered around
you know and so we all have the ability to do that and and and that is you know going back to Marcus Aurelius that is how we can improve the quality of our thoughts let me get this very powerful what what a true regardless we may consult astrology to some degree or Sunday I've generally we're not going to get too caught up in it as fun to Yogi's what we do get caught up in his the main thing right the main thing is I want the Krishna Gras the main thing is that I want is that I want to have my mind
 be moving in the direction be influenced by that planted in my life in that and I need to make that plan at Central and I cannot lie put it right in the center of the house and it brings all auspicious this to every facet of our life whether we're going through great times travel times we have family were single whatever it is adding that Krishna planet to your life it has a tangible effect on your York
Consciousness and people see it in you people see that but like you bring Good Fortune to other people and that's exactly what we're hearing about Pearl odd that you know he had that planet you know that was his that was it his what do you call it like your guiding star you know that was sending you no influence in his life was that his mind was it was his mind was strongly influenced by being drawn towards Christian maybe for me the commentary room
 this preliminary is the Vivid example of a of a great person fully absorbing Krishna Consciousness is 78 on a charge of Rita a fully Krishna conscious person I will situated in this material world is not see anything but Krishna anywhere and everywhere this is the sign of my huggabug about the man that sees Christian it everywhere because of his attitude of pure love for Krishna
like you're seeing Krishna everywhere how do you understand that
 well as you add and Christian to your life and everything becomes Krishna centered in the same way you can see that in your life by the same way people see other things as the center people think people are very focused on how can I get make money you know I should be making more money than everything they do every person they meet their always decision to critique this is just a medication in the mind works you think okay how could this relationship lead to me making money how could this there's some land for sale there how can I make money out of that lands you know someone selling that I would if I could buy that cheap and then sell it to everything and the same as if you're looking at you know you know when I was young skateboarding I could skate on that I can grind on that or whatever whatever your mind is focused on you going to be putting that there so if you really start developing your mind and Krishna then you'll start to see see if
all that flowers for Krishna your work out of Sri Krishna make some money how can I use it to store Krishna everything becomes Krishna conscious it's actually in such a great phrase Krishna conscious instead of sex conscious money-conscious you know enemy conscious drug conscious people into drugs that's a meditation to they're always looking for that drug or alcohol and whatever it is that's the focus give it to us we just yeah give me a give me a husband and a wife you know I want kids and now we need kids I can't have kids you know all these things they're not going to say good or bad sometimes a very bad but it's sort of like they consume our Consciousness so we're in the process of trying to make ourselves Krishna conscious and I will say this you know me and Mara whenever we eat
 we've been eating very nicely here light but nice and then every time we eat we read the sheet on your body with Bhagavad together and it's just be when you add something like
we're going to read together first of all makes the relationship for a sweet but then you always give people coming up to you like what are you reading I'll tell us about what you're reading and if it puts auspiciousness at the center of your life so work I'm just trying to get by reading every day while we're here it's not just affecting me but and it is it is it is affecting me it's also affecting everybody around me and it's making you know if you if you're feeling like you're having a tough day at all add some hearing and chanting at some reading to your life just even this Christian I didn't bring that crashed into your life and you're going to change your day and you're going to have fond memories of that day even if things aren't like working out well matter fact it wipes away your anxiety if you feel like it and I'm hoping to get a raise I'm hoping this is going to happen I hope this person calls me back just add Krishna make that the first deepest connection
 and the Crystal take care and that sir
the melt your anxiety and put your faith back in Krishna your trust back and Krishna instead of my great you know design I have for myself I have some puny design for myself but Chris has got so much greater plan has got my back Krishna knows what I need and when I need it don't sweat it Rock enough Chris is going to take care of it so by investing that trust and Krishna it makes everything it makes all your anxiety melt as well makes everything auspicious
 and you know we can we can look too in so many people like the princess you look into the Gita like 15 chapter Christian says on the Splendor of the Sun
 on the Splendor of the Moon I enter into each planted in by my energy they stay in orbit I become the moon and thereby Supply that used to like to all vegetables on the fire digestion in the bodies of all the entities and I join with the air of Life outgoing and incoming to the jest four kinds of food
and everyone's heart even so this is the way it's saying a lot more so we're going to Mahabharata great to voting they're seeing Christian everywhere is nothing that they see disconnected because it's all Chris his energy and he's directing it all on on multi-levels you know so they're moving through the world with that awareness and that's called Krishna consciousness
 and they also see Krishna within their own Hearts which is what's surely about your next asking for an umbrella samita
 okay I was thinking about something you know like all the planets a whole other the planets are beings challenges of being in Saturday Sean he's being there all beings but there's also a Vishnu connected with each planet as well and I was sitting in our life to we become
 to the planets will have an effect but also God
behind those Planet something in our own life we have some Karma that were dealing with but when we invite God into our life even the inauspicious things
 become deeply connected to God and they become all that that's why they come all auspicious it become quite wonderful even things that appear like tragedies which we hear about about tragedies that make a person completely you know shed their false ego
 where's our paint our pain is in my broken ego I got school all that that's where the whole thing is my pain isn't my pain doesn't come from me getting rid of my ego and door strengthening my Eagle in feeding my ego okay now I have money now as soon as that
 it's just like realizing that that's not even me anyway and sometimes it takes some something tragic to read you know to go through that so I can have this beautiful question by Tomas from Germany
going through some Medical in a bodily issue where he's like man I might have something of serious cancer or something like that and he was calling up with how should I look at this how how can I get rid of bad anxiety and our answer is quite simple and I talked a lot after the words by the way we were each other but it was like we do what we do on a normal basis is we add more Krishna to our life we add more Krishna and we stopped relying on our Good Karma to to make us happy and a lot of us listening to the show right now we're born in the Western World were born affluent perhaps we born with you know we could go anywhere we want we're not destitute without running for a life for the most part so when we have a lot of good karma we don't like lean into Christian that much I just leaned into my credit score my bank account or my American Express card
 but when things get tough
then I feel like my whole life is falling apart and that's when I took my point to him yesterday was we leaned into Krishna in times like this and what it does it sheds the false me if it sheds that like that's right I'm not he's a tall good-looking German Surfer yoga teacher we're not any of those things we are tiny Spirit soul with a very breakable body
 very fragile body and our only connection is to get to this point of destitution where we can With all sincerity reach out to Krishna Krishna you're my Lord I'm Yours what would you like for me
 they start practice
 I love you Thomas
