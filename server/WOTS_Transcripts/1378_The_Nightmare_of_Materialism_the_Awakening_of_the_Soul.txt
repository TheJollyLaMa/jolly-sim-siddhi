 Wassily Kandinsky
 is that how you say it was silly
 Wassily
kandinsky's is a painter abstract recognizes
 here's what he says
 are you pronounce the V you pronounce the W as a v a silly silly silly silly
 thank you Marty the nightmare of materialism which has turned the life of the universe into an evil useless game
 is not yet past it holds the Awakening Soul still in its grip
 let me say that again that nightmare of materialism
 witches turn the life of the universe into an useless game is not yet past it holds the Awakening soul and its grip still and it's gray
yeah she got off at like it was I read this you read it that was a dramatic read like I rock out like it was like you know the soapbox guy standing on the corner light going off John the Baptist style that and that's a fine way to read it again thank you I read it all different okay how did you read the stupid. Stupid speak there a certain Clues here that made me think this guy was like reading Vedic stuff bug of agita marrying a nightmare is not real but like we might throw night we throw the word nightmare out that light just saying like this is just like a terrible situation but I think when he said nightmare
 him he was indicating something still more that a nightmarish yeah it's it's horrifying but it's it's an illusion of The Nightmare material is a material is
means that were an illusion but is painful and then he says it's turned the life of the universe into an evil I'm not sure how he's using evil but it seems like if you go back a century or so people can use evil to indicate like pain you know suffering rather than let me see the problem of evil we're talkin about the problem of suffering right as opposed to like satanic or something like that right so the nightmare materialism this illusion that were in which is turn the life of the universe into an evil use this game is too painful game that we're playing it's not real replace you know
 is not yet past I don't know what he means what in what context you speaking like if you means like it as a as a global kind of thing you know is it's social thing we where we haven't gone past it or as an individual he's reflecting on his own life maybe journaling or something I don't know
 hasn't it passed it holds the Awakening soul in his grip
that's what we want to do or mental to awaken but it's materialism
 the illusion of materialism that's causing us to Spain in this has a stuck in this game that's that's that's not preventing this Awakening
 but I want to hear more from you on this some more things I want to say about this time you say that interesting Lee enough although a nightmare is temporary
 so is a great dream ever have like ever have wonderful dreams like oh man I was such a good dream I want to go back to bed those are also temporary they are right so the great dream materialism sometimes we're on the downside of materialism like I have no good matter I'm trying to collect matter I've lost all my matter right and sometimes we see very successful people lose everything and it's like a nightmare and then sometimes you're on the top
call Raghu
 navigate brother froze up on us 40 hey there's some more Chu to share more of that another with us has his the nightmare materialism which has turned the life the universe into an evil uses game is not yet past that holds to awaken soul and its grip only a feeble like glimmers like a tiny star in the vast Gulf Of Darkness sometimes you just need to hold on to that glimmer of light hey brother hey did you hear about it up into that higher pitch for all the good stuff came out
 I don't know if you want to go back to it now I can't remember who it was all God wasn't spot God was talking through me I can ask him to come back at this point when we say materialism recognized
find it
 I would say
 Charlotte keeping myself as a center in trying to gratify my senses in my mind with with stuff or or with things that endorse my ego okay
 I have the definition here and there's two definitions I think they're both important one of the first one is more like where you're going a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values
 that's one
 and then the second one is like philosophically right the doctrine that nothing exists except matter and its movements and modifications that's called material isn't too and one feeds the other I think that that Doctrine or that ideology you could say right I think the word ideology is because
connotations nowadays although I'm not sure exactly why you don't see like that system of thought
 that there is nothing in my mind is just the most bizarre ideology
 you know it seems like it requires such a leap of faith is just like crazy to think that there's nothing but matter that life and Consciousness are product of matter I just don't see how those how you connect those dots you know but
 it it it really comes down to this that this is what you're saying that the material is not you're saying is like I look for happiness
 through external things through matter right I'm looking for happiness through matter that that becomes my my way of moving through life this this
spiritual texts that come by and they just present something very different it just a very different idea right that actually your happens you don't need to look for it anywhere but within yourself and that's why and then he's like he's using terms like awaken it right it's not like you got to go out and find something you don't have yet to wake up another another facet is that when things are going a little tough
 what are you leaning into
 to make the pain go away are you leading into more sadder but sometimes people really try to solve their Pain by consumption by consuming I'll get it I'll get wet rid of my Sadness by but by purchasing things and then I'll go in to sort of like titillating sense gratification like but my sexing my feeling is by drinking my feelings by smoking or taking some pills it'll make my pain go away and will numb my pain
but they never solved the problem they generally those ways complicate the problem even more they add layers of problems to my problem so I was just talking to someone who's going through problem right now and I was just saying
 it's the problems are okay and they're in the problems are actually a type of medicine like sometimes a medicine is a stringent or bitter but if you lean into the bog of a time that everything is happening the material world will actually heal you it's the very thing that actually is torturing you will actually heal you you'll realize like I needed this I really needed this to get closer to Krishna so that's one way that we can just maybe an aphorism to remember when you're feeling that pain when you're feeling that loss when you're feeling that sadness try to lean more towards the bottom but I'm more towards Krishna more towards the light more towards love more towards truth and then watch the pain of this world something magic happen
paying that pain becomes almost like a necessary food for us to brush to a super food for us to grow that you do you know what else is kind of its Accord that it struck with him me
 just cuz it got me thinking in these terms of materialism spiritualism or spirituality
 I see that like a I don't know if I'm more tune to it now but I see amongst like within Christianity course you have a wide range of people and how they approach it right you have these deep Christian Mystics and you have like incredibly sincere Christians then you got those guys with the snakes I want to meet some my babe you got to go to Lake Tennessee I think of you get the church is like the butt.
how late is Prosperity Gospel ya want you to be wealthy yeah I pulled that up here on Earth this is so we can put definition of prosperity Prosperity theology he presently that's where it's going so hold on that hold on to that Prosperity theology sometimes referred to as the Prosperity Gospel the health and wealth gospel the gospel of success Seed Faith gospel Faith movement it's a religious belief among some charismatic Christians that in here we go right that Financial blessings and physical well-being are always the will of God for them and that face positive speech and donations to religious causes will increase once material wealth material and especially financial success is seen as a sign of divine favor
 and the way that I understand that is
 you get people that are going to be prone
are like I'm I'm approaching Christianity but I'm not tasting some you know I read about great Saints and experiences that they have but I'm not having that and but this so so that I began to slide back towards materialism that rather than rather than go for the Deep spiritual experience in life I reach for the material you know that the the Tennessee decanter material possessions of physical Comfort is the most important is more important spiritual values I'm practicing materialism in the guise of spirituality and there's going to be a huckster there that's cuz I'm at Meijer
 there are there people that I see whether sorry Christian Movement or broader circles or Spirit spiritual circles with people that were connected with that I've seen
more clearly now that they they they have stomach they come to bhakti they get some experience they don't go too deep into it and then they begin to monetize it
 by saying hey you you want spirituality just like I do but I discovered something
 I discovered that I need to let go and be free
 of all of the religious kind of ideas but they're not the religion this is a spiritual idea that you're having trouble with his right right but but but you know and you are meant to have a life of material abundance to when you tune into the universe it's just naturally what you have but your way down by all of this religious stuff you got to let go of all of that and I can show you how to do it
 pay me some money and I'll show you how to do it I'm not even I'm not even upset of people are business coaches like that
here's how to keep your accounting your setting to do some marketing it's when they say hi to merge the two like God will give you God gives you favor for those who surrender to God that is so true Shredder the god that are destitute but they're still incredibly connected and there's great kings that are incredibly connected that's right. Trying to merge the two like if you're its successful God favors you got some good karma perhaps and you got any of endeavor dwell in business but once you merge the two just keep it separate cuz I'm leaving tell us that when you're especially favored got takes everything right and I think we've all been there when you're specially favored we've had these times in our destitution deepest realizations came out of the people who are successful business who all of a sudden go
to nothing and they're very deeply connected at that point and it's not because God didn't favor them
 right and there's people come on we know people who are grossly materialistic and have lots of stuff and they're so disconnected you know spiritually so that's different our connection is different from our stuff and our collection of stuff we're not even saying we're not even anti stuff we're saying take whatever you got and use it for God and you'll feel connected or in your destitution reach for God and you'll be connected stuck trying to merge business with spirituality and you know there is the restrictions and the regulations that come with in religious or spiritual traditions
 it's a question of how you apply them it's a question of really understanding their purpose and is question
fine tuning it so that you're applying them in a way that is healthy so definitely can be misapplied no doubt nobody's questioning that but when someone comes along and tells you just let go of all of these innovations that you did that you have there they're no good for you you're naturally meant to be enjoying materially and I can show you how to do it just pay me some money and that that's the big red flag right there and historically we can look and say you know
 on the side of self-control you know on the side of regulating your senses and so you're going to find Jesus you're going to find Krishna you're going to find Boudoir you're going to find Saint Francis you're going to let you know like all these incredibly switch and on the other side you going to find a big get a load of hucksters you know what greed is greed yeah
greed is greed and he have to be careful because you might get into this for all the right reasons and then get tricked back into greet again it's and I was always wonder I was like isn't that why we got into this in the first place cuz it it hurt our heart we are almost disgusted by what greed can do to the soul or what lust can do to the soul or Envy in competition could do for the song it's almost like we have to check in on a regular basis with these with these energies that we knew can corrupt our our Purity Purity it's one thing about trying to just you know make a good looks like a good honest living then a good honest living out there and then there's just like
 on harnessed greed and try to mask it with spirituality and it gets ugly
 when you think you're going to
all right brother.
 Red harness Creed your little bit about materialism and the futility of it from our friend
 the python man is he actually called the python man I don't think so
 Krishna all right
 we should we are just at the Bobby's having to retreat today I was outside picking flowers for my worship and the dog was there and the cat was there and there was a frog there and all three of them are like in a line together and ladies were like oh my God there's a look at these three items I've got a photo of all three of these together they're all living here in harmony super so far I was like I got a feeling that nothing but kill that dog was feeling I got a feeling the cat just released the frog from his grips
rock is like in shock right now it's not like the then the mice are embracing the cats here Super Soul it's still the material got to get there though Spirit to our life
 pics of lion it makes the material world almost magical and we can do these experiments like a retreat weekend at a picnic at the park at a Rafi otra Gathering which were doing next week in La at a retreat a pilgrimage you can actually create a bubble where you're not of this world anymore and you really feel like this is what the spiritual world must be like but it has to reach the animals to Rugrats I want to see it work on that low that can I can Embrace I just don't think that broad was embracing the cat this morning and is a big frog to be there you don't even know it
 okay ready
 rain in the Musketeer

 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with at the porch light of knowledge I offer a basins he's at their Lotus feet
 refinishing Maybach the time can do 7 chapter 13 text 28 python man
2828 yes
 God is favoring you young man God wants you you just need to claim your you need to write play in the Lord's inheritance
 you got claimed it yet cuz scuba that's why you're sitting your apartment without any air condition I have an abundant life
 not as abundant as God wants you to be God wants you to have all the all the tools of the heavens you sitting there in a one-bedroom apartment without AC friend cuz you haven't given your heart to the Lord I can help you with that don't care whether I will text you do you say we're on text 28 casula okay so the python man is speaking he's just lying there
nobody coming asking the questions yet right
 A La Carte on there's something special about this man he's a lying on the ground but I think there's something I think he's on to something so began the present question to ask tell me about yourself you're lying on the ground you just seem welfare but you don't work or anything like that
 what's going on unapologetically Crave Your wealth
 okay text when you're in this way the condition Soul living within the body forgets his self-interest because he identifies himself with the body
 that's it right there yes it's just his forgetfulness at least our misery in this way the condition Soul living within the body forgets his self-interest because he identifies himself with
body just like you know what's interesting to waking up a dream ever have ever get woken from a dream of your start thinking
 like I was having a great dream this morning that we have peas like we have these psycho alarm clock Birds they don't even act upon like Sunrise their cockadoodledoo in like any hour after 4 a.m.
 whatever they want. And they are like they're not following anything from the Sun or the moon or anything but my point is this
 when you're coming out of a dream sometimes you're like the dream like I'm giving up my identity in the dream world it could even be you rescued me from a horrible dream you know I thank God that was just a dream but the interesting thing is when we start you think matter is
everything and if we we we developed this philosophy like my abundance in my might might my things in my but when we invest our identity in our stuff as are worth
 then when it's time to leave the body
 the attachment is there attachments strongly there there was a devotee I knew and I heard the story that he was he was like you know he was a you know a businessman as sincere devotee but it is a business man and he shared the story of how he was getting swept down the river ganga to die like somehow you found the ganga engagement swept away and everyone it was asking what we'll reach hanting were you thinking of the ganga or he's like as I was getting swept away I calculated my entire bank balance of all my thinking of
briefing like an ass facts as you don't even think that you would think a materialistic person would be thinking about I don't know they're the family or something like that or is it say anything about the accident bank balance your actual bank balance
 we get so invested in this as an extension of your I think about what you think about right at the bird I can tell him about what you think about everything shifted and upon that's your meditation
 you got it that's what you got so we got to change oil
you know what do you think about money when you're done I would body do that
 I don't know I mean it depends on your karma it depends on your karma right how it's going to manifest you might if you have good karma
 we might take birth is a very wealthy person but I suppose in other ways you know it's manifested so many ways but you know we really have to make a strategy if we if you think about what you think about and other stuff at the time of death what determines your next birth is what you're thinking if you think about at that time what you've been thinking about during your life then you need to create a strategy for your thinking the highest thoughts and here's what I'm doing my latest part of the strategy right now
 you know I get up very early
 and I go all day and then it about 5 or so I'm wiped out you know like I'm tired it's like five 5:30 I can't do any more concentration you know I just don't have it in me
what are you doing in so that's a point where the Run vulnerable when we should reach out to him and this is where I want to take over the podcast I don't know not vulnerable that but at the same time like I'm at the place where I can't go running around the city like to get in late at night cuz then I don't wake up early in the morning I need people to come to me at this stage of life I'm almost 60 people you come to me know what I feel the same way it's hard for me to even bow down offer a base and season the more it is bound down every time you come on man I don't make me do burpees just to say good morning here so it's so you know I have these shaming I'm going to offer obeisance these to you and you're going to have to just stand there cuz you're old you're all right so you know I had to boil over
last week you know you will roll on in here about 5 we spent a couple hours just
 reading together talking together that's the that's what I need I need human interaction in my house with good people reading good stuff and that way you know that I can make the whole day like
 thinking good thoughts you know yeah I got it I got to get the other wise YouTube is there you know I'm saying it's like oh yeah oh yeah we were doing job walks in the evening lately. It walks in the evening
 I suppose that's another way to do to I could go out to the park move the body and Chance some more rounds extra you know we haven't even finished his first first hit
 okay
 because the body's material is natural tendency is to be attracted to the varieties of the material world variety
does the living Edge City suffers the miseries of material existence okay so there's a level of materialism being discussed here where we're seeing herself as the body where identifying with matter that's materialism brings us back to yesterday or the day before yesterday that they're evil it's that such Pleasures have a beginning and an end and after you've had enough of this material world you get to intelligent point where you go you know what I want another type of pleasure I don't want pleasure with a beginning and an end you know they say the wise person they're satisfied just with their knowledge
 right it's like it's like I used to think I need this to be satisfied but just my knowing the truth I feel fine
and so the other is that ignorance that I did materialism here's one materialism is ignorance either one of those definitions
 you like that one or not you think about what we keep the main thing the main thing you like these kind of double up one how about this for materialism is materialism has been bugging but he's he's he's kind of pointed out that this is forgetfulness that leaves her mistress's forgetfulness of the truth is I didn't and that manifest is identifying with the body identified with matter okay. We're going to go in as few verses soon as next week vs29 there next to verse 29 and 30 the futility for the search
for happiness through materialism or through external so we could say right just as the deer as big as a deer because of ignorance cannot see the water within a well covered by grass and runs after water elsewhere it's right there in front of the living entity covered by the material body is not see the happiness within himself but runs after happiness in this world you know when I Prop Hunt goes and interesting place in this, so I think we need to read the entire commentary I used to do when I was a kid trying to give a regular analogy now we used to get the what was that catalog there was some catalog we had a perfectly good in the old days when you used to get catalogs for Christmas
and they just have any catalog out like a Sears catalog it was the can't remember what it was but there's a section of toys do I look at that toy look at that toy and if you were like a lady and have ladies clothes and pajamas best winter vest in a man that I met and they're all a man models from and look at those toys battle axes Circle them I want that till I don't want that till I don't want that toy you would actually circling just circle. Yeah I just hopefully my mom would see them not that I've ever get any of them that it was like a subtle message you first I don't know who to call to the god of the universe and Bud Hilton vacation for my desires but anyway it's like it was unbridled desire 11 your desires Bill Dwyer Wild
 like a child walking through the toils I want to I want that
 where you going with this
that's it was just like what it was like to be have unlimited desires you just living in this world of hope that next time I ever satisfied often times when you did get one of those things it was just like short-lived was like okay that was fun but that in the closet with all the other Toys R Us, turbo. He's going to he's going to deal with materialism on two different eyes when I when I heard this well covered with grass what did you picture in your mind
 why picture well
 and like brown grass growing over it or you're asking why is the grass Brown because it's dead and when it dies it falls and when it falls it covers a whole always going straight up always like around the edges of it then it flops from last season by grass
covers over that falls through the waters right there and you can walk it appears I can walk right on it and then hit it and then it was assumed that the grass was growing due to the water of the well right that's what was feeding it
 then think that well I'm just taking to the next logical thing in other words words again that's what it's going it's right there it's it that do all the ground around that well is moist
 because the well is there
 I wasn't thinking that but that could be something that either until the water is deep deep in the ground
 if you go deep enough like extremely deep hate to kill your analogy LS we would pay
this is an accurate example depicting a pair of a living entity because of lack of knowledge runs after happiness outside his own self when one understands his real identity as a spiritual being you can understand the Supreme spiritual being Krishna in the real happiness exchange between Christian and oneself
 that's there there's real happiness the real there's no really says he real he means as opposed to illusory happiness
 okay it is very interesting to note how this verse points to the body's growth from the spirit Soul see I didn't pick that up when I read it first thing this is this is a a
 what do you call it like a counter argument to the materialism the second definition that we discussed that there's only matter
 that matter
the doctrine material isn't the doctrine that nothing exists except matter and it's moving some modifications so a materialist believes that the body is just a movement of matter and there's no spiritual cause behind it
 those innocent Consciousness which we recognize as a symptom of spirit they say no consciousness is just nothing but the modifications of matter
 a proper saying that no actually matter develops out of spirit
 without Spirit there's no matter and the shapes that it takes and so on have to do with spirit so he wrote it again he said it is very interesting to note how this verse points to the body's growth from the spirits all okay continue please see what he says here is the Hope for water out there
you know I ran into this guy yesterday who is why are you changing the second not what smart it's real life examples of what of the deer running for water in the water trial in front of them but that was said another point that was supposed to come back to his car to like 30 Years Ago by devoting at said there's nothing of this material world 2 actually satisfy you you maddest person yesterday you did too but anyway picnic at the film editor and so he was filled with you don't desire is if you're new in the film seems like no one of the big things with my wife I want to do big film editing I don't want to just edit some little YouTube Tik Tok video whatever I want your big editing
so who's who sang so I heard this and it stayed in my heart that this world there's nothing satisfying of this material world and he said he started climbing up ladder and then he goes to the then I did it I was editing a Steven Spielberg movie we're going to be over I was at the top of it and that I remember that quote there's and I thought you had a big deal I'm doing this I'm at the top of it some people never even get here and I think about only could get there it's right in front of them
 and so that's when you actually have to say okay I'm still doing my duties in this world but I have to direct a connection to my spiritual nature as well the well is here cuz you about the well is the well is here but you're a filmmaker it doesn't matter. He's always in here.
he's like taking happy pills I think why you so happy he's like that when he's like weeding the garden
 he's always Blissful not now you see what we're going to do jump back to the first definition of materialism I was working on the second one to go and complain about the one probably stay with your progress, it is very interesting to note
 to know how old is Bruce points to the body's growth from the spirit Soul the modern materialistic scientists think that life grows from matter but actually the fact is that matter grows from life this is a big one that I know you would like the life or the
she also is compared hearing to water from which clumps of matter grow in the forms of grass seed at the grass is grown because of the water but then the grass covered up the water just as the body grows because of the soul and then it covers up the soul is ignorant of scientific knowledge of the spirit Soul does not look inside the body to find happiness in the soul instead he goes outside the search for happiness just as a deer without knowledge of the water beneath the grass goes out to the desert to find water the well is here the well is here the water the nourishment is here
 the Krishna Consciousness movement I love when he says that it's like it makes you want to be like the Krishna consciousness
the others out there you're all part of the movement and so you guys are thinking well I'm not really part of the movement of your sort of gazing into your part of it now okay I'm looking at faces Martin your part of the movement Timothy your part of the movement David hauswirth your part of the movement the Krishna Consciousness movement is trying to remove the ignorance of misled human beings were trying to find water outside the jurisdiction of life okay I'll try to find it to matter through to a job or through a possession or through sex or whatever it is that Abundant Life that abundance at who's stupid wants so bad
 Russell Vice ceraso him up so you can take the taste of water is Krishna is Krishna to quench one's first one must taste Water by association with Krishna
this is the beta conjunction somebody says this is the very conjunction he means Russell bicycle that's when they'll punish shots. That's the type to really punish Assad to send this is Aveda conjunction like even go back to these original books it says it right there Russell by Saha which literally means like indeed he and he in this case means the ultimate the supreme god indeed he is Russia
 and that's like a like an infinitely deep you know aphorism but he'll probably say another has Russia in Russian means water recipes juice recipes flavor recipes taste and so say we're searching for tastes outside
 when actually the real taste is within cuz God is within your own heart you can connect with God within yourself when you look out set you do Russell lies to her indeed he is
water that was looking for he is a taste of looking for Russel him up to counter your Krishna says to to Arjuna beta taste order I am that taste of water so yeah it's it's so again he's playing with this idea that material list
 think that consciousness
 it's something that is nothing but the modifications of matter say no no no actually Consciousness or life
 only comes from life is a symptom of life itself which is irreducible which can be modified its Eternal you know it's irreducible
 in the body that we get has to do with the content of the state of consciousness of the spirit and the you know what you think about is what you think about so tell me what you think about is what you think about it when you would ever even think about your life to think about the time of
is that your State of Consciousness and then you got the form of a body built around that
