Cy gems we can perhaps uncover in the coming out that sounds great happened but the really great to have you here why do we just start with your life story like just tell us you know how you grew up and how this eventually led to your life is as a the bacta and is a Swami yeah I do know I mean you're a veteran at this so like we do podcast and people ask us this question every time and I think that's how the story differently every time depending on how I'm feeling on the particular day
 but yeah I guess I grew up as we know I was spiritual Jenny doesn't begin in this life we kind of carrying on from wherever we were in previous chapters of existence and yeah when I was very young I was always interested in kind of
attracted to Wood minimalism Simplicity and age I learned about monks people and kind of turned away from the road and proceed something different and I guess from a young age that was speaking to my hot family yeah I grew up in a Hindu family in Northwest London so I was kind of going to the temple and kind of having some kind of religious observance but nothing too involved or philosophical yes substantial but yeah I was growing up and I guess the things that people pursuing that life as success when reading moving me in the same way and so I began searching I guess I read the Bhagavad Gita first when I was 15
 and and then yeah I'm at the monks soon after I started conversing with them and when I was 18 I went to University
and I guess that was so so life-changing time I was living in London living away from home for the first time and I guess ya away from the normal opinions narratives and having some freedom to explore life a bit more the dark side and the good side I was living just behind our temple in central London so I was also a frequent thing that Temple and also live in my university life so it was yeah comparing lots of different approaches to life I guess I'm going to be studying computer science and management I wanted to actually study philosophy Because by the time I Was Eighteen I was already interested and inquisitive but yeah my parents convinced me to do something practical that would get me a proper job so I study computer science in management and yet
City yes I just began delving a little deeper into Krishna Krishna Consciousness the Bhagavad Gita and then when I was 21 I just yeah I knew that I couldn't just going to a job and a career I really needed more time to figure out my trajectory and so I decided I'm going to go India I didn't have any money cuz I just like spend whatever it was thousands of pounds on the University education so I ended up becoming a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport you know those guys that wreck your luggage on the tarmac like throwing the bags into the yeah I was doing that for like 3 months ago enough money card ticket to India and that I went to stay Asha Mumbai chowpatty
 many of you know his Holiness radhanath Mara age
that was kind of his base and so we stayed there for 6 months travelling is that what year was 2002 lifted for six months in 2002 and then came back to the UK and then decided to do another year as a monk in a monastery in London
 area one year turned into 2510 Chinese I lived at the Manor for like 20 years and then a few couple years ago I accepted his daughter of life's and yes I'm sorry I'm traveling more than Man in The Manor London is still my base but yeah so I guess the general picture I'm wondering so so when you say you and their nouns to order and once since you've been living renounce to already but that men like a lifelong vow when you do when you take that thousand yes yeah it
find a lie, so these two stages of renounce life when is known in Sanskrit brahmacharya is like student renounce life and and then there's a b n e r switches lifelong Ronaldo's life and sometimes people go from student Reynolds live to lifelong they kind of just make that transition on money will live student renounce life and then make the transition to marriage and then eventually retire and then perhaps go to was renunciation and so yeah there are different different courses for different horses as they say and yes I took that vow and what is essentially means is that we make a vow to live renounce life for the rest of our lives in one sense is kind of like closing all the doors like you you walk through the door and then you
close it behind you and then there's no going back and you just kind of try to like now just focus on on the way full with two to Eternity so
 but I'm curious to hear from you about one thing I'm curious to hear from you about is so you had a particular plan or that your parents had a plan that you would kind of pursued in a successful career and life and I usually that would include you know a wife and a home and kids and money and it's on but you started getting an inspiration from Bhagavad Gita and from monk said you had met then you enter that life and then just stayed with it and you stayed with it and stayed with it there must be something in that in that renunciation or in that closing of the doors that has a taste that is satisfying or so satisfying
that you're ready to leave behind all the other Pursuits that pretty much everybody else in the world is pursuing could you describe what it is that you went when you wake up in the morning or when you lie down to go to sleep at night or as you move throughout your day what is it that's satisfying to or driving you or or inspiring you what is that you feel or experience that makes you say this is what I want to stay with this is what I want to I just I want to live
 I guess there could be many things but two things which come to my mind which are kind of interlinked and I would say the two word Simplicity and Folk
 for me the idea of simplifying things and not having your mind in 100 places
 rings of Saturn Focus I'm living a life where every part of your life
kind of aiming towards the very same thing now of course the bug of agita says that you can also achieve that when you're living in the world you know you connect your family life to your spiritual Pursuits you connect your career to spiritual Pursuits part as one of our view as I'm sure I have experience is not always easy you know because you're dealing with the world and wasted so much complexity and it's difficult to bring everything in line and synergizer in that way but monastic life is a great blessing because you almost like say no to everything else which has he mentioned is a bit you know that takes something but the gray Advantage you get is that you get this life to lead we're practically everything you're doing from morning to evening every waking and even sleeping hour is kind of aiming towards one thing
 and I think that level
focus is actually really beautiful just to kind of be totally immersed in one goal and I think that that for me is like really satisfying kind of mine is different you know where even were born with a certain background of mine coming from previous life and then it gets more shaped again through our childhood some Minds may I suppose some Minds May connect in Buck tea in a in a sense of narrow path or simpler path or let's say our path that sound strip down and some you look around and I thought he's got a huge house he's got lots of kids whose God you know all kinds of stuff going on but it's all good but it's also all
 focus in a way so you grew up in Hindu family it seems like maybe your interest kind of
exceeded your ear your interest in spiritual to your quote-unquote Hinduism come may be exceeded that of your parents I'm sure you must have been exposed to different teachers in different lineages a different ideas the personal approach to understanding the absolute truth and personal approach what was it that made you think of Krishna bacta that's what that's my path that's what I meant to follow
 yes surprisingly enough actual but I grew up in a Hindu family it's not that we were so philosophically exposed to different things we are going to a bunch of different tempos we doing a bunch of different rituals we were introduced to a bunch of different types of worship but it was very kind of ritualistic it was very much just a cultural thing more than something which was deeply
Delilah and and so I guess my first philosophical Explorations were with the bug of agita I remember when I was fifteen I really wanted to read the Gita so I went to the library and I got three versions of the Gita I'm all from people who are kind of yazz passing different philosophies different schools of thought but none of them really resonated with me because I felt as though they were very heavy they like they they were just very much in the mind they're almost like philosophical gymnastics and I think What attracted to me what attracted me to the Krishna parts to Sheila prophet's teachings to should have brought up his Gita was that it was very practical it was kind of like this is the philosophy and this is what you do tomorrow to live it
 and for me that was like beautiful like I don't want to read an undermined was giving a class and of course he was at Harvard and
I'm studying so much philosophy and he said that what he appreciated was that he came to the temple I think it might be Buckley Temple and he said I heard a class and they told me your seven of Krishna and it was an amazing class and at the end they gave me a mop and they said now the temple and he said I love that because it was the first time where I could kind of take something and really live it and really experienced it and really do something with it
 so yeah I think for me that was it what attracted me to Krishna bhakti was how transformational and applicable and into Gribble if that's what it was in our daily life so then your first kind of full immersion would have been in the temple got to go pee. Temple in Mumbai
Volkswagen Austin I spend a lot of time it's kind of a home away from home for us as well and as when we were when we were monks we also spent a good amount of time that at least I did maybe not so much could you describe life there like what that was like what the training was like what you learn who you met it how what was special about that time
 yeah few things stand out about my time there I think the first thing was family and friendship like I was coming to monastic life and you know like
 as for example I was reading a Buddhist book of monastic life when I was kind of getting interested in this kind of stuff and it said Perfection for a monk is if you die and nobody knows and Nobody Cries and I was like wow that's amazing I was kind of like I had this kind of concept of monastic life a disconnect
Solitude and being in Mumbai was like a real kind of hard time shift cuz it was such family there was such community that was such friendship and I realized for the first time that without relationship there's no deep emotion in spirituality I'm sorry the openness and the kindness and the bonus of the other monks there in the whole Community Open My Heart in the different way I think the deepest spiritual experiences and it shifted my conception of all of you know how to actually live my spiritual journey going forward and now if anyone asked me like what it what is your what's the most valuable thing you have in your life
 then I tell them like hands down is my relationships and send my friendships with other
loving family and friendship was definitely a big kind of
 yeah something I really done there I think another thing I learned was just an intensity of spiritual practice like I was chanting on beads kind of before you sleep I had gone to Mumbai and I remember coming for the first day that I have the kind of morning program at the temple and sitting down to Chun with everyone else there and it was like the first time in my life I was like wow this is like serious these guys take this really serious and like everyone would just sit down cross-legged close their eyes and they just me and it was like it was like it was intense and all right it was like for the first time I realized that spiritual practice is really serious business
are the fortune I got time right now Swami video so comment and Sean with everyone and so not everyone will be you know it's like vying to fill that spot where you can shine in front of him as being in that kind of company of someone who is very absorbed and individuals are very absorbed that was very powerful for me so we are like deep spiritual practice was also and I hang the final thing amongst many other things for maybe I can share some
 study of the scripture
 intro para TI I kind of we would have all these classes every day that I'd like a Brahma Cherry class a class with all the monks and and it was just amazing to see how how they would drawing all these amazing lessons all these amazing kind of
 yeah life hacks you know from scripture and it was my fault
biodiversity of scriptures very otherworldly you know something that would help you definitely in your journey and Eternity and here they were like really discussing scripture in a way which was transformational to us like now and I was like wow these books are really like multi-dimensional day they really so you really inspired me to look deeper into like wisdom and scripture that says you know the the monks there are so many of them are coming from the top universities in Mumbai which are really top universities in the world like i t
 and the you see something so Dynamic and what they're doing is that you're here young men in most cases born and raised in Hindu families
 Maybe not maybe a maybe a circumstance similar to yours where the family is kind of following it but not with
 Apple
standing of its significance
 maybe some of it is just tradition and you just following it for the sake of tradition of to be Pious to cultivate some good karma has in life and then they would go into these universities and taking from like the way that she'll probably is presented bug of agita unpresented trim Ababa time presenting it in a way that was much more like hey we can transform ourselves and transform the world through this knowledge this isn't knowledge that's just some traditional thing to cultivate some piety in life but this is actually has answers and it has answers for the individual has the answers for society and when you're when you have these like super brilliant young monks going into the universities and presenting this is like boom you see all these people lighting up is where you watching that happen or was that happening to you while you're there
 yeah I was just amazed at how like the first lie it was incredible to see people
we were so intelligent who would like the top of their kind of generation academically and they were just like being stimulated by this knowledge of scripture on being able to present it in in a way that address people's needs interests and concerns and
 yeah it was like it was powerful I never I never threw of wisdom in that way what are the tracted me to monastic life was not so much the wisdom of it but it was more just I guess the lifestyle of it the idea of solitude and you know just complete focus on something otherworldly higher spiritual Dimension but it really connected me to like wisdom as one of the greatest treasures that we have so yeah and they were like engineering students and kind of
mathematically minded which I guess is kind of like a little bit who I am as well so like they would look for like patterns they would look for structured they would look for a flow like church on a chair on the spiritual side has already had one like it he'll just categorize and systematized anything you say as you're saying it in his mind and then applying it to the to the philosophy of the spiritual philosophy so. Kind of like just breaking it down was like was beautiful I have bit of a mathematical brain as well as I do also try to do that of course over the years those are moose I realize that. Can have his limitations as well cuz like everything doesn't have to be the five stages of this or the full aspects of this or you know the sequence of this song sometimes life is just a little more than that you know but but it helps in the beginning just to kind of get a picture and just to immediately
yeah kind of gross things so yeah that was that was impressive and I find it interesting that you said as I mentioned I was sober I'm a cherry
 14 years and I started visiting the Radha gopinath Temple and spending time there I start to get to know the Romney charge when the other monks from their maybe as early as 94-95 and I started visiting there around that time and so then I got to know them very well that would stay in that a strong for a few weeks or so for the time and I would also get to know that entire community and so when I asked you what you found what what what was important about that time for you you mentioned that the family not just through the monks there but like the entire community
 and you know Rhonda Swami's
the depths of what he did there. I just kind of found it to be for there's no stone unturned here some like that like he really thoroughly brought in at a depth of spiritual understanding into the
 the the forms that we used as a form of what it means to be among the form of what an ashram is meant to be the form of what it's meant to be a married person the for all the different
 forms that we create to give some stability
 but that can also become problematic if you're not careful and I remembered like for instance the life of a monk and that life of letting go of everything and simplify your entire life the wisdom that leads one to that it is a beautiful thing and there is something beautiful that minimalism in that Simplicity that Focus but when we're new to it
 is it
maybe almost inevitable north of that arises from that has some pride in that you know there's like four we're better than those that don't follow this path of those it apparently need these things of the world
 and I remembered and of course as a monk I'm sure I invited that to some degree hopefully I was gradually maturing out of that and I and I witnessed it you know it in so many different ways and I remember the monks there telling me that Radha soami established the rule for all the months and that was
 the moment that the monks begin to criticize the householders is the moment that they're asked to leave it was like that strict it was like really drawing a hard line and an n and with that you know he was training the the householders to really admire
and and hear from it and support the monks and he was training the mom's to really admire and then didn't see the depth of the Krishna Consciousness in the householders and and he created a kind of beautiful
 hello codependent is right where but a beautiful Union there that just manifest in a way where you step into that world in your like it's all here and it's all happening in a beautiful way there's I'm hearing the same wisdom the same knowledge the same culture from from different angles from different angles and it's being manifested so many different beautiful ways to Beautiful People that it was really something special there
 yeah I know for sure he really created this community of appreciation this community of respect you know that
 open on Sirius would look at the household is in
they're so busy we've got so many responsibilities that got so many demands to attend to but still just see how dedicated they are and then that the monks would go back and think like we need to do more we need to be more dedicated you just look at them they're doing so much even though they have so many well did you tease and then the household is would look at the monks and say like just look at them they're young they're intelligent they could have done anything but they've given their whole life for service and we should do more we should you know also stretch ourselves and like that they learn to see the good in each other and that's the beauty of community that we are able to see the diversity celebrate the diversity and also draw and
 yeah kind of loan from that diversity and
and I think it was so by Nature the the household life develops certain qualities within you and the renowned Sly. Develop certain qualities within you and we can share with each other like the renounce life develops the quality of definitely wisdom renunciation that kind of Simplicity because mission of sharing Ibiza kind of qualities that you naturally as a renunciate would develop as a household sacrifice selflessness compromise learning to
 yeah kind of empathize with others these are qualities you have to learn as a household and actually all of these qualities on both sides need to be cultivated by both individuals
oh yeah my guess it's a it's a beautiful thing when we have that Community I remember they also had a real there that when you're asked to do something if you say no that's also when they asked you to lie it was that in one sense was that Bridget it for the for the monks like it was like it was like you come here
 in a sense you give up everything even even your own freedom to just you know you you're in the military and in that sense you know you hear your servant your full on Cervantes unit 24 hours a day but you see what it would create the you know the young the really beautiful characters that grew out of that ashtray so then you spent how much time there
 so I was there for 6 months in 2002 and then I came back to London and I was kind of like I don't think I can just go back into doing a job now like I have to explain
this weather so we have the manner which is the money Street donated by The Beatles which which was kind of a place I was going to form a young age sorry yes I decided to commit to like living there for a year as a monk
 yeah and that was the beginning of my end so I'm assuming since you've developed over 50 courses at that point you started developing courses or shortly thereafter developing ways to present this to a particular and universities
 yeah I think one of the great blessings of my life was that I think from practically the first day in living in the morning stream London the ashram I was showing from the faith Fest day I was learning I was hearing and then I was explaining and I was expressing and then I was learning I was hearing and I was explaining and expressing and that kind of rhythm of breathing in Brie
breathing in breathing out I just feel like it was one of the most beautiful ways to go kind of deeper into the knowledge to go out and to try to think like how does this affect people like what does this mean for people's lives and and then hearing how people receive the knowledge and and what doubts they have and what obstacles they have and what difficulties are there to accept it and apply at learning all of these things made me go back and study deeper to think like okay how do we figure this out and then come back again so yeah we were going to universities
 of course I study that you see also was the very first place I went back to I was like I'm going to go back to my university and teach them something so I used to go to UCLA on Waze to the events there and it was beautiful and enter this Barracks yeah I like II
I love going to the University's just the other day we were Illinois Institute and down this trip will be going to a lot of different universities such a beautiful place intelligent young people who are questioning and I was really good for me yeah
 and so you could in one sense you're doing the same thing now I think it's just kind of grown and matured and certain ways bringing bringing knowledge and in different forms you have the sound Line Pizza Pipeline could you speak a little bit about that
 yeah we started this kind of a platform but first we started the school about tea at the Mana education at the Manor was going on for many years but we kind of r e c r e a m bigger right today you could say so he started teaching a lot of courses that are systematically like you know
which are sometimes lost which are you know multi-layered and trying to just make them more accessible for people and trying to teach them in such a way that you had like we said people can apply those knowledge that those insights yeah and then we thought why not do something online that way the world is now so we began a couple years ago teaching courses on the Bhagavad Gita online survey gun laws different courses recently we did something cool life hacks from the Bhagavad Gita so we talked about the secret of manifestation the science of communication facility in a friendship the yeah I'm forgetting that the signs of letting go so we we talked about all these things and you'll be really develop the beautiful Community now so we have big courses every year where anyone can kind of just connect and then we have like what we call Geeta Circle
yeah like we have about 40-50 groups now where people just kind of connect similar to The Sage groups and it's beautiful as a community on it
 yes I'm a place where people can go and learn things and in a place like in the space where they won't be charged and and and where you know we really try to yeah I have a very open for them so people can really Express themselves yeah
 and where do people go to find out more like a package of course has a website. Org have an online kind of ugly on the social media platforms and yeah I think this this month we might be beginning something you can log on on the website and yeah kind of connect
 no
I thought maybe we just throw a few kind of random questions at you about life and it just throw out a topic and hear what you might have to say about it but even before we just before we get there and I'm curious as a person that's British
 but raised in an Indian family and a Hindu family spent time in India when you come to America can you take a look at us you can be honest with us ok Google Shoot Straight what do you make of this place like from your I'm interested to hear from you through your eyes will you know if you threw your eyes as a person from another part of the world as well as a person that has Through The Eyes of a monk as well how do you look at either New York City or Merrick has a hole or both you can be honest I think even less of America very different actually like being on the east coast and being on the rest cuz it's like your New York news that differ
Pace you know the first thing is that I think will Americans what-you-see-is-what-you-get
 Bridgeton to be a bit more diplomatic tend to be a little more kind of don't open up immediately that kind of test the world to see how things are going and then and then so that openness I think is
 he can be beautiful it can be misunderstood as well and it can it can maybe cause a little bit of yeah exactly but I think that openness is it is beautiful it is that Curiosity that Honesty you know it's interesting that in the scriptures we say that the Lost leg
on which society stands now is truthfulness and is it there's a beauty to just being able to be open being genuine being kind of revealing what I have is in your heart and I think that has great benefits for someone's Jenny obviously temperature in Sunway so yeah I bet that's one I definitely have one observation I have some of America and Americans another observation I have is
 motivation I feel like
 at least in one of the parts of America is being and whoever Ivan to face there's a sense of Minnie having drive to do something maybe you know America has always being a country which has influence the world
and so I find America and very driven people generally which I think is very beautiful thing you know it is it really has their potential and and allows them to make contributions to the world in America Through The Eyes of a monk
 I just I don't know I think
 should have brought our founder came to India came from India to America I'm he really love for America because he just found
 found it to yeah I guess be very welcoming to new ideas
 and I guess I guess that Still Remains here and I'm there for Wherever I Go
see that people are very welcoming and yeah even yeah I think it was written in profits biography that in America even a saffron monk coming from India like nobody really even in New York City yeah yeah I was like nothing amazes anyone hear you know the temperature in New York Casa. That just welcoming kind of spirit as soon as she says a few questions in a week sometimes you call it like a prophet style interview where we just throw out a theme and you just share some thoughts so as a monk who was like oh so many things including money
 what advice would you share with us about money what to think of it how to deal with it any any thoughts about that
 yeah
who sings
 done with integrity and spend with generosity
 Austin the money in and of itself is not bad it's interesting the biblical statement says money is the root of all evil but I think the actual statement is the love of money is the root of all evil and so I think we've money but we encourage people to do is first-lien it with Integrity sometimes what happens is in the process of pursuing wealth we lose our balance belews relationships renews our principles and therefore like in the pursuance of gaining this money you actually lose something much more valuable and so I think the first thing is to end with integrity
 I need The Vedic system is kind of like Dharma harta, and
Moksha and and and and you know everything begins with principled living and until I think that's the first thing and with integrity and I think once you have the money it's like spend with generosity like how can you utilize that money to benefit
 you know more than you're just immediate circle and you're a media interest and so when we do that and when we utilize money in that selfless way then it actually connects us to our spiritual Essence and and I'm really satisfies the hall in the Deep Way and so is beautiful like an Ava in a movement in our communities we see individuals who have become incredibly successful and fabulously wealthy
but they aren't it with integrity and they spend it with generosity and and I guess that's the spirituality of money
 you know is there was such an interesting answer I think I'm going to take a little bit more into this because a lot of people nowadays
 if we say earn with integrity and if I had my own business then I might begin to think okay how do I apply those principles you know I'm not going to do anything unethical but if I don't direct my business if I work for a large corporation and the corporation I have no influence expand exactly how it makes its decisions in and what it does and it seems like I may be kind of locked into this is there a mi on a horrible path if I'm working for a corporation that whose ethics may be questionable is it something that I need to think about getting out of right away is it something that I can work with any thoughts is there a way that
what I'm doing here can be purified or Sanctified in some way or is it hopeless
 yeah it's um
 Christmas is in the bhagavad-gita every Endeavour in this world is covered by some fault and those are ultimately wherever we function in this world there's it is likely that we're going to be connected to some level of corruption exploitation kind of yeah. Kind of thing
 why would say is two things I would say the first thing is definitely we should always be open to trying to evolve towards a career and a and a way of working that's in line with our principles as much as possible and so you know the tendency is once we have security once we have a kind of job that pays the bills and which is comfortable I kind of just like I do
Disturb This let me just like carrion but it would be beneficial to always be open and make an Endeavor to evolve to Woods not just a career that lends you money by Korea which really is in line with your principles and and Anna and a company which is having that the ethics that you would want to ascribe to the thing I think is that even if you are in a company a kind of you know Global corporate which you know definitely has questionable policies I think that end with Integrity can still be implied in the sense of how you conduct yourself with in that environment everyday you walk into the office every day you kind of conduct your interaction and then Affairs and how do you do that what kind of character do you and Jen. How do you relate to people you know I think I love that Integrity is
in your control and so we can always do that and maybe spending with Integrity helps with that spending with generosity so we may not be able to affect the company itself but from what we get from that company in terms of whether it be wealth or influence or power and knowledge or ability we can take all of that from a company that has questionable at 6 and then utilize it in a good way so
 it's interesting like if we look a bug of agita Christian matches this every every Endeavour in this was going to cover by some kind of false it's it's actually a very
 flexible forgiving kind of mood he's asking Arjuna to fight a war he's asking Virginia to kill people on the other side even though people on the other side would like some really special people
and it almost feels like our tenancy
 particularly when we get into like to start speaking about spirituality is to begin to demand of others
 I don't know what level of Purity I suppose that we feel is the proper ethic
 and we may be become unforgiving in terms of recognizing the difficult circumstances that a person may be in that this world creates but it seems that perhaps Krishna is his approach is a bit more forgiving a bit more tolerant a bit more a bit more otherworldly as well maybe a bit more like yeah the life in this world is always going to be difficult I want you to get yourself a line with the spiritual type of thing I want to do the best you can on the spiritual level here but also I want you to recognize in recognizing that on
 things in this world are
hard to be as hard for things to remain perfectly pure in this world let's let's align with that as well as we can
 do the best that we can with a difficult circumstances that were in and make the most of it and it's still kind of find a way to purify ourselves as we move through it
 yeah I think if we can go to bed at night and say like I'm making my best effort here I'm making my best and ever I'm I'm I'm trying to work with my situation and sincerely go to bed at night and say I'm trying my best
 then I think that is what Krishna looks for
 this is famous story where Prophet was going out for a morning walk and anyway they were driving towards the park and they got stuck in the traffic jam so they look
by the window and there was a sign and it said roadworks temporary inconvenience permanent improvements have driver looked at it and he started laughing and he said the material world means temporary improvements permanent inconvenience so it's kind of like that you know like whatever you do the world is a kind of worms if you solve one thing another thing opens up you can never really quite get it all under control but it's almost like in that endeavor to get it under control and I'm just doing the best you can you actually develop what you actually trying to develop internally and so it's kind of like the other story of the guru we talk gave his disciple I don't know if it's the Buddha sometimes I subscribe to the Buddha I gave his disciple like a kind of bucket which had holes in it and he told him like go to the river and get some
what time you ran over and got filled it out but by the time he came back all the boat escaped and then he went back again and he tried fast and then escaped to gain and he went back at the time he came back and he's such a degree as useless and the girl said well I didn't actually want water I just wanted you to clean the bucket so it's almost like that in in the Indian devotee to try to be as pure as you can you just get purified an an an an an internal. Tikhon's even if X 2nd everything is not as you'd want it thank you very much maybe we can in there but I am really appreciated that you came here and I'm really hope that we can you was going to say just community in and you and your in all the work that you do in the semi we can maybe find a way to connect it together yeah definitely is spinning on a thank you everyone for Cheating in
