 oh you know we know the saying I just heard today that
our dear friend by you
 I just feel like he's okay but he got it you know what I think was a surfing accident
 Penny I dislocated his arm something to the vertebrae there's like a whole thing he had to cancel he's had to cancel his age group and sending prayers
 waves in Australia are tough great Sylvia
 okay alright already William Blake Blake super level
write like next to Shakespeare psych him anyone's in history some of that
 I really hope it's with a lot of things going through my brain right now
 he was O'Mara says He was largely unrecognized during his lifetime but after his
 after after his last weird, that's weird, to get isn't it like in this life piping Vincent van Gogh is like that too
 marinade as although Blake was considered by contemporaries considered mad by his contemporaries for the idiosyncratic views he came to be highly regarded by later critics and readers where's expressiveness and creativity and for the philosophical and Mystikal undercurrent within his work is painting some poetry have been characterized as part of the Romantic Movement and that's pre-romantic
I was little bit before ahead of my time to bastila get if you think about it in other words you're saying that everyone perceives you as being crazy perhaps you understand that okay okay
 if the doors of perception were cleansed
 everything would appear to man as it is infinite doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is infinite infinite infinite
 there is an interesting thing this concept of the doors of perception and they can be cleansed in a sometimes people say people say I and I want a boyfriend I want a girlfriend and me that's what you think I should do you know anybody I always give the recommendation give it to somebody Heroes list on the show today right now
Whittier wait a year and be alone with you and God
 and work on yourself there's no more urgent time then when you're done more better time than when you're alone
 because when you can work on your wasn't no better time for what there's no better time to work when you're in a relationship with somebody and you're working on yourself it's always a little problematic cuz a lot of times your shortcomings you tend to blame on the partner so when you're alone it's there's no urgency to do but it's the best time to do it when you're single you can really work on your time and it's the most valuable thing you can contribute to a relationship and I use the gross example of suppose you're addicted to alcohol
 in that state of consciousness in that perception of the world who are you going to choose for a mate when you really start to work on yourself and raise the bar of your consciousness of who you want to become and start working on
controlling the Mind Control in the sense of being the best you you're going to pick a completely different person even in 3 months or 3 months 3 months guess what the universe is going to send somebody to it's not that person wait wait and then how does it have this turn it to add a podcast to help you find your soulmate he's out there
 are 1999 a month that gets you into the club
 no I know well it is because our choices have to do with our how clean the mind is I started thinking of the goodness and then I start thinking of how we can change how can we change the gunas if I am steeped in Thomas and Rogers how do I change that how do you cleanse the doors of perception how do I how do I what you do when I hear doors I think
you don't like bug of agita all this piece of like the gates right like the senses sooner the eyes to ears yeah I better and you know in the in the third chapter of Bhagavad Gita Krishna tells Arjuna how, you know how how desire material desire how it clouds our perception and then he says
 he says the census the mind in the in the intelligence are the sitting places of, of material desire through them, covers real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders them and what is the real knowledge of living under the real knowledge is I am infinite right like I'm Eternal right there's like there's no end to me I'm made of Amber Moss me I am spirit that potential to understand that
 you know what it's there it's but it is just that we're not we're not understanding Who We Are
because our senses and are impulsive mind and our intellect have all been programmed kind of hacked and program with false ideas of what I need to be happy and and so and so and so the practice of yoga and in the practice of Bach to you how to cleanse those Gates how to cleanse the mind how to cleanse the intelligence how to cleanse the senses so that it's the soul is kind of shining through them ride rather than being distorted through them it's good mood good mood food for the Consciousness and tells me a second a second so there's ways to up our game up our gunas
 matter fact when you living in an ashram you sure that you can't help but do them for the most part cuz it's your living in it like a collective
 but do you remember living in the Brooklyn Temple at any time in back then
Brooklyn Temple now it's in the best neighborhood ever back then it was like a total ghetto neighborhood ever but it was really bad pretty good neighborhood right now. Have you been giving me a Marriott hotel across the street to walk around the block at night time it's not exactly like the best neighborhood ever knew you can't afford that so you can a lantic Avenue and State Street anymore cuz they price my man I live on West 71st
 you can't afford that either we know it's called an insane asylum they were just saying enough for you then let the the people that with some there was definitely some you know mental what's the word I'm looking for
 mental health issues and
and everybody there's always someone like we're just walking around like losing their mind on the street remember that building across the street caddy corner is still there is still there but I don't think they're there in the best neighborhood anyway my point was I went in there once I went in there once I was like when I walked in there with a pink robe in a little ponytail and I just realized no one is going to get better here no one is going to get better they're going to medicate these people and they're just going to keep the system going cuz to really change and to really change your perceptions that the doors to perception you got to change your goodness and there's ways to do it there's a whole system of how to do it and one of them is you have very clean food one another is you rise early you go to bed early another thing is sacred sound in your mind
Outlet that's playing in the atmosphere or the literature that you read or the media that you consume if any also connection of nature there was like no plants was completely sterile you need plants you need nature in your lives
 then you need some reason to wake up something to do everyday then you need wisdom literature on a regular basis so you tell this to them they're all City cleanliness wake up and you need to bathe immediately when you wake up if you're not doing that I'ma show you better do what you going to bed as soon as you wake up babe that should be sure that this will work for people with serious mental issues know then you need boots a video that and then you need an exorcist okay I guess I can help with that as well cuz there are spirits that inhabit bodies but the thing is you are making them you're making your body a host
who are The Spirits by keeping yourself how to paint we keep a little bit in the background right now if you don't just lead with that okay it's not waiting on you brought this up I was just saying he has to rise early take a shower and you said serious mental illness and I said yeah I didn't bring that up you brought that up and I couldn't help serious mental illness I said cuz that's the context in which you were speaking about it it well they were it wasn't there so it there's always a okay maybe you did to their lifestyle can change their Consciousness and there's other people you have to take them to an exorcist okay and they do food and they do monsters and they do rituals that part of your culture man
 it was part of our culture
floor it you know what I did
 the shoe my body was, yes I know that that's basically you shoving a cork in my nana no no no no you misinterpreted where it's going you put you put me in a little box right there and assume you know where I was going but I was going to say okay what else what else is part of our culture
 the respective mother cow
 all right I think house cuz we should have brought us the cow no cuz the reason why I thought of this as you were speaking today in the courtyard of the punch of touch with temple they had like they set up like a little lamb it's a big area and they set up like a little fenced-in area and they brought a beautiful cow in there
 only hinders to appetite
only Hindus at do this type of thing and they did a little Pooch over the cow you know and and people are there it was really done
 really nicely and I could tell it was me and
 and I was watching it and I was thinking how
 so many Western Minds would witness what's going on here in just say this is ridiculous this is crazy worshiping account you know that was so crazy but what I thought was this
 how to explain this it's like it's like you're thinking you're coming from such an advanced Society
 I do see if I say I'm like a western skeptic to this kind of thing and and what what they're doing is they're recognizing just what a special
gift in our lives this cow is right that's nice way to put it and they're honoring that rather than they consciously are like it I love how I let how you may have become expert at normalizing the bizarre sorry I have something in my throat but the point is that the Western world is the Bizarro world because the Western world is entirely Cow Palace to this beautiful gift and I say let's kill it and eat it
 this this is a magical being given to us by God if we just honor this this beautiful creature
 look what it provides for us
let us do a do a ritual that will help us enshrine it in in our minds appreciation
 for this gift for this weekend that's not which society is more more advanced the one that recognizes that gift and not only recognizes it but I kind of like standardized has a way of relating to it with appreciation or the one that uses his killer needed
 did you see what Meredith feel a message board you see that
 I just checking I'm going to I was eating I was eating lunch America's look behind you there's a giant standing in the doorway
 and she's like it's part of this part of the culture here also I was just watching Instagram which I do occasionally and there was just this Shiva Temple and it was the same thing it was there's a Shiva Temple and a cow just walked in
like someone walking to the temple with a video camera to film Lord Shiva cow like licking the idle and licking licking The Langham and if I touched his head to the deity and just walked away and was just for like business as usual
 yeah that's what I'm talking about bands it's all welcome here it's all welcome here come as you are your cowl you come come with the couch we will talk about the alligator the holy alligator in South India the recently passed another thing but there's also a religious elephants people have dogs people are very religious dogs
 you don't have another nugget I kind of went with this one regular you want a double nugget me today this is from the Stark Munro Letters by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
 you're familiar with Sir Arthur hero
Sherlock Holmes have no idea Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the Stark Munro letters
 and I are you connected with this cuz I'll come at throat is just like I was going to slip on marble floors thank you Henry looking out for the cows Henry thank you okay thank you for that honey cuz they're thinking of this thing about the doors perception it when the cleanse everything would appear to men as it is infinite and I'm thinking about what we're reading now involved with time with baladna Rush Collide Mirage doesn't see in terms of friends and enemies you can't see that way because he has has been a vision of of infinity you know like I don't have I'm not competing with anyone over limited resources I am Brahmin I'm Eternal I don't have a competitor I don't I just can't
scene from this other level you know his doors of perception were cleansed right now you look like on the platform of Brahman I don't accept and end
 and so but it's not in the in the gap between our understanding that and are realizing that between the gun and the beginning between the knowledge and the realization of that knowledge that's that's where we exist in our practice of box your head like that that's the the feel that we're navigating and so this is what Arthur Conan Doyle rug he said and I think this is like in his novel or whatever this is the Stark Munro level letters that made perhaps at the novel I'm not sure so it says I can come what may I am bound to think that all things are ordered for the best even the bad
is it happen to us in life are good and they know for sure though when going the when the good is a furlong off what's a furlong Mary what's a furlong so that metal off please distance of how many hands
 how many hands it's like one not
 prolonged 120 yards of Fairlawn good and couldn't do no good so so come what may I'm bound to think that all things are ordered for the best the one the good is a furlong off and we with our Beetle eyes
 evil little B Thalia little bug eyes
 can only see three in its it takes some confidence in general principles to pull us through
 confidence in a principal like a monster
we have to hear these texts we have to hear these Concepts we have to reflect on this concept have faith in those Concepts confidence in those concerts to pull us through this this feel that we have to navigate between knowledge and realization
 and we do that by you don't share this with each other on the daily basis write thank God thank God for this stuff
 okay you okay you choke on your own throat is gone crazy and water and I like an incident that's so free check out now if you share that a couple times so sure he don't know when you drop it in water it business and instead I just drank it down and it just lodged itself as like a perfect did you actually use water.
or did you think Auto just busy out in my stomach I just I put a little in because I don't want to just make the sort of like a a bathtub plug in my throat

Haha yeah that guy she was trying to kill you I'm going to gargle for second to that doesn't have a good luck but I spoke about the path of self-realization in devotional service
 Gus Bell baseball to the to the camp of his father's enemies
 Veronica choopu the king of the Demons heard provides words and he laughingly said thus is the intelligence of children spoiled by the words of the enemy
any parent knows this when the kid comes back and start saying some bad words it's like oh my God who you been hanging out with
 Whitakers is Jenny's house yeah there's he had to be here to get this from somewhere that that becomes part of the team here that the enemies are infiltrating some now cuz it's kids here in this somewhere yeah but this is the first I've never heard my mom curse
 okay she talked crap
 so I was just going to mention you know there's four questions that are going to be ice in this chapter of
applied in the first one and each time he comes through with these super mature
 deeply spiritually realized answers you answer the first question was what you know what's what was your favorite thing you learn in school today and they came across with this verse about how materialistic life is like falling in a deep well that I should leave it all behind and go to print David father's expecting something like volleyball now he's going to get ask the next question cuz the teachers are so concerned about where did you get this text Kevin Honeycutt shih-poo advised his assistance my dear demons
 you must not call them demons asaurus I mean that that's that's their lineage you know that my dear Esther has give complete protection
gurukul where he is instructed so that is intelligence will not be further influenced by by snobs who made go there in in yeah you know that Christian guy coming into the campus and hey guys
 when he ready cuz you put his servants brought the boy prahlad back to the gurukul the place where the brahmins talk to boys the priests of the Demons Sunda and a markup pacified him with very mild voices and affectionate words inquired from him as follows so that you know he is like the yeah it's like you have the king of the Demons child you know and you know you don't want to anger him so there's like oh dear provide them all peace and good fortune to you
kindly do not speak lies just reply with the truth these boys I could tell that to a kid right like just tell the truth through you're not going to be in trouble you're not in trouble everything's going to be fine these boys you see you're not like you or they do not speak in a deviant way I'll have you learned these instructions how is your intelligence been spoiled in this way right yeah it's going to sound like if you if your advice Nava Especial like a teenager your vaishnav teenager and your father has short like a big businessman in your store if you want to become a Saudia it's like now
 Larry Hartwig shared his story you know who's really interesting you retired
 it was on the Shelf
 okay, back to
he didn't follow in the footsteps of his father who was who was his father a lawyer I forget what his father was I had a big business or something and in the end and family to head up that's not the life I wanted one of the natural life on a build a cob house in live in nature and grow my own food in his father's I can come for it
 oh yeah his father said he wouldn't wish this business on his worst enemy right now it's nice of your family has this pollution of your intelligence been brought about by you or by the enemies we are all your teachers and are very eager to hear about this please it's going to be good who told you this stuff you can't approach the hunger Hunger by the shirt
Tamara I want a name she's like well you know how do you feel in pain names talk to you like that I could name a name I want to name names names another Seinfeld on right now that was this was the second question right where did you hear this from what is it from the enemy's right the device numbers the demigods to devote vote is vishna now I wanted to we're about to hear perlas response and this response next few verses this is life-changing stuff coming from out of the mouths of this little boy and it's the kind of stuff that can that can help a person an aspiring Yogi or bout to Yogi
 progressed from just like
 I'm attracted to this stuff and I'm into it on a wanna do it to like really understanding the change the internal change that's going to proceed their deep spiritual realization but where they really need to address their own
internal perspective as if we were talking with respect is bent but I want to preface it by going back in the bottom time a bid Rugrat back to the third Canta if you remember her run your coochie poo
 is the Sun
 is she a and b t i c a n t t r i t t e r and so does she was giving there was this an auspicious time that they could see the child and he said this is easier this is going to be in an office in one sense it in our special spot at this tile they were giving birth to this interesting we conceived and we don't even know what we're doing you know what I mean now that that's how it's done there's a spot.
but it happens there's a whole science of conception of calling a soul into the womb and I don't know anything was very aware
 and this is what he said to his to DT he said the learning catch up this is Truman Bob with Tom third Canto chapter 14 text 44 through 46
 he said the learning cacioppo said and catch up but he was like this real Yogi right like deeply realized Mystic
 and he said because of your lamentation penitence and proper deliberation and also because of your unflinching okay so this is coming after you already said everything is this some real espitias kids coming down the pike you know but then to kind of like his
say there's a bright side to this he said this but because of your lamentation penitence and proper deliberation and also because of your unflinching faith in the Supreme personality guided and your adoration for Lord Shiva and in myself one of the sons
 of your son
 and right now we're talking about Claude the sound of here on your coochie poo one of the sons of your son will be an approved volume of the Lord in his Fame will be broadcast equally with that of the Supreme personality about it like when we speak of a baby speak a lot it's like we speaking them both together and then he said this and this is something that we can all take to harden did think about meditate on it in order to follow in his footsteps a lot of footsteps saintly persons will try to emulate his character by practicing freedom from animosity just as the purified processes rectified gold of inferior quality
interesting right there even any sort of God I pulled over at the mother of a demon and I stayed there while you were talking I was burning with should I read it again it was very good but I'm thinking like wow this is it dialogue from what I say for this to work time for for my own benefit
 he's saying that for centuries to come really right
 in order to follow in the footsteps of prolonged saintly persons will try to emulate his character how specifically by practicing freedom from animosity towards any living being I don't have any enemies that we're trying to do this I'm telling you that practice that.
process that is the process and in the end the the metaphor being used is the purifying practice processes that Rectify gold of an inferior quality write their processes of heating and in it with heat and other ingredients to purify gold to remove all of them all of the impurities in it are process for doing that in the heart is hearing about prolonged hearing his instructions hearing about his character meditating on them following them ourselves trying to imply that our cells that is the heat that purifies the heart you don't allow us to
 come like him become deeply deeply relax but to you that that blessing of kush APA is still happening right now we're all looking up to make sure
okay so the question was this is because this is a dialog imagine being the parent of a demon
 I was talking about imagine how tough that was for DT right how do you say Clayton's how do you think Leslie Stalin felt or you know Michelle Dahmer whatever the mother of the mother of these horrible like I still love their kids that's still love the kids but anyway it's interesting it's very okay now answer the question has been asked where did you get this stuff this this
 devotional kind of rhetoric that you've been speaking did you get it from the enemies it has your has this pollution of your intelligence Veronica it with you have been brought about by
the enemy is now just hearing that that phrase that here in this question a lot so they're living in the world so please read text 11-12-13 these this is his answer was good stuff here ready at 11 for La Mirage replied so young prince
 let me offer my special obeisance he's the Supreme personality of God had already that's not the answer they wanted to hear that energy was going to say he's six and Powerful intellectual teachers super powerful intellectuals and he's kind of just like entirely
 intimidated right
 sweet sweet
courage in such anyway please cancel yeah yeah basically so the Supreme personality godhead whose external energy has created the distinctions of my friend and my enemy by diluting the intelligence of men that's what about backhanded slap by diluting the intelligence of men like you guys indeed I am now actually experiencing this although I have previously heard of it from authoritative sources I've never seen anybody as stupid as you look real stupid people but you really number one in your category I've heard about stupid people like you before this is a good day for me I guess that's 12 when is spring person out of godhead is pleased with the living entity because of his devotional service one becomes a pundit it does not make the
oceans between enemies friends and himself intelligently he thinks every one of us is an eternal servant of God and therefore we are not different from each other. We just solve all world problems here text 12 to give the credit to this is the treasure chest that the whole world is digging for the mysteries of the universe
 how come here they are we're going to give him let's call the world Summit come together the world leaders and I can come in there listen everyone listen to me that's something for you text watch watch me the commentary to text 12
okay we're going to eat careful because you are seeing that so so well it might actually YouTube May pick that up and there might be complicating issues know I am kidding I have a kitty it's so well I can't remember one of the words it was Toto by the way and I y i
 all right when is spring present of God had his please with a living entity because of his devotional is the purported and demoniac father asked him how his intelligence have been polluted a lot more I said as far as I'm concerned my intelligence has not been polluted right what is the actual default the default is is everyone is in my brother writes rather by the grace of my spiritual Master by the grace of Lord Krishna I have now learned that no one is my enemy and no one is my friend that is the default of the living
now we are all actually Eternal Servants of Krishna but under the influence of the external energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme personality of godhead as friends and enemies one another this mistaken idea has now been corrected and therefore unlike ordinary human beings I no longer think that I am God and that others are my friends and enemies now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eternal servant of God and that our duty is to serve the Supreme Master then we shall stand on the platform of Oneness as servants you know just
 did this is bringing up certain thoughts in my head running shoes with you baba ghanouj in Africa
bring up certain issues, I love you. Okay love me know when poor lad was asked a question he said the first thing he says I offer my respectful basis is unto onto Krishna
 Hobart Welders people it's his diluting energy says external energy energy that creates the distinctions of my friend of my enemy so he's saying it's krishna's energy that puts one into delusion when someone wants it right and then in the next verse he said that when he becomes pleased with someone you don't want it anymore then one becomes a pundit and does not make distinctions between friends and enemies and so he's saying that our delusion or are clear perception
 is granted through the energies of Krishna
you say to the Parma into God in the heart
 and in this commentary words it's mentioning
 a couple different things that screw up that perception one is the idea I am God
 and another was the idea of these are my friends these are my enemies because sometimes when people rise above the friends and enemies thing
 is it took to rise above the idea that this person is my friend this person is my enemy you have to realize the Oneness right that were all made of the same spiritual energy in and changing bodies in the changing circumstances are superficial and that looks right so exactly when one so when one Embraces this idea of one this they may think actually is all one and I am part of that one and I am God and so promising both of these delutis
and you know it is something that I've been studying in the bug of agita bit lately is this idea of how Christmas speaks of confident I'm going to now I must feed you knowledge more confidential or I'm now I'm going to share what I just shared with you is the most confidential secret of all the Vedic literature and whenever he's seeing matches about four times in the bug of agita or so that that kind of message would that hear some special more confident more confidential and what you read in the Punisher odds and end in The Vedas and so I'm going to share with you now
 and he doesn't only share that information which has to do with understanding that there's a supreme person is in the heart of every living being is behind that the the moving's of this world and that can delude us or remove the delusion that there's a person that you connect with that does that
and that's the confidential not so when he says what when he speaks of what it takes to receive that most confidential Guiana right he said he says he doesn't say the qualification you you might think okay what are the qualifications for that you might think it's the self-discipline and concentration of the you stronger Yoda or you know that the renunciation Detachment of the Guiana Yogi but it's not these things he says what it is is is the devotion of the body of year I bought those same a psychology 84 husham hate to do tomorrow because you're my devoting my friend Arjuna
 therefore you can understand this for hot this this deepest secret you know or or he'll say because you are non envious are because you're not full of the desire to be the
Central enjoy your to be God yourself right there for you can understand this now therefore I'm revealing to this Raja video Rodger guyoung this is greatest knowledge this great his secret and so
 that's the same kind of messages here being it is is a realization provide already has a six-year-old according to our inner desire we become bewildered or if we'd like all those in our selfish controlling desires we become a pundit don't you see that there are no friends and enemies okay would you like to continue the time to beat the summer darshana there you go using by by saying thank you everyone has a natural connection is made there to that purse you
please cancel demons think of everyone as a friend or an enemy rights with that statement that is a dropped pin like it I'm not feeling this person my friend this person might you should understand you you're off the road you're driving your car is driving off the road you haven't even though we need an exorcist Renee P99 I will get you next year says I will be your Exorcist I will do a photograph of yourself and him to hit a hundred eight times table say that since everyone is a servant of the Lord everyone is on the same platform
 thereformation of treats other living at the bees neither as friends nor enemies but instead tries to spread Krishna Consciousness Consciousness teaching everyone that we are all one Servants of the Supreme Lord but are you still asleep wasting our Bell
who lives by creating Nations communities and other groups of friends and enemies what do you think the perfect world would happen to have Nations
 I suppose it would not rather not to be interested in the stupid Loca what will it be like
