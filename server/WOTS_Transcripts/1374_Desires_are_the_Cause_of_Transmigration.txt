 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the sages a daily spiritual podcast that makes ancient wisdom relevant today I'm your host rocking out with co-host and Senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York this stupid ass welcome to the show welcome to the show everybody this is episode 1374 here live with me or spend in the dials cuz dude was in New York City and we just got back late last night from Vermont what a great trip a lot of bright lights in Vermont cuz scuba lot of great peace out if you had a good time up there oh yeah and then
Ashton Kutcher go pee and show me a price went for 22 Mi bike ride around Lake Champlain hold it hold it all the way around took such a long bike ride it wore you down a little bit you seemed totally ever. I think I got a little stronger I feel great from it
 that was baby it was too hot last time I think this is every weather may be dehydrating my first sort of my first day out on a long bike ride so
 so do I feel good feeling good and get a sociation and makes all the difference you know it's just like we say it's like you become like who you hang out with and that's why having a bacta community wherever you go is so important because you need people you can check in with on a regular basis and we're saying that you know it's why we did the podcast originally more than anybody else I needed to check
I am a regular basis we need some accountability it's good and healthy to have positive spiritual accountability on a regular basis that's why I'm starting that's how we grow right bye-bye checking in with wisdom literature on a regular basis brands that are want to lift you higher friends when I lift you up instead of dragging you down I think we saved the baby off a couple of those friends and drag us down to learn who to friend and who to unfriend and who'd follow it would unfollow in this world but you had a just a handful five or six people some of that Mara was one of them I believe right for the starter just like conversational you know what gives us together every 5 a.m. a.m.
 and then we started getting bigger with some of the yoga students who started going to the bog of a time the Super Soul s son got before Zoom was a thing and then we have that up to 80 people every morning just from yoga
Benson hardcore people and then the stupid jumped in that we started doing it and then 2020 January 1st we said let's just turn this whole darn thing into a podcast and that was the birth of Christmas ages history
 you know how else we used to get people to get into it you stop Mara prop your phone up she would hold the phone up this is before we even had Suma think you just hold back. Phone up on Instagram live baby were also on Zoom but she'd hold up the phone on Instagram live in Hollywood prop it up against like a coffee mug and then it is it was so awesome proud but it doesn't matter people join that's how sean acaricia the vegan trucker joined

Bakke Center board meetings full day things and so I wasn't able to have my rounds to past days until like 5 p.m. 5:30 p.m. and I just go to the parking
 and I bumped into this I feel really bad cuz I'm forgetting your name that was a wonderful propolis I believe lady from New Bern David and I always bump into her mind for when I'm walking around and she says I listen was with sages I love with him stay out of the hole that she leads tours around my poor you know like toys
and I was just walking through the park and I bumped into her and sent you a text just like we always bump into each other when we walk around my poor as I call this is great my crazy story was and I'm going to tell her I might have told it a long time ago but I was when I was just stop being a Brahma Cherry they needed someone to live at 26 2nd Avenue so I was like all right I'm going to move into 26 S I got to live there for like 7 months you then and I gave class every day programs every day and then I and I have one brahmacharya I was training and there was no shower so we have to stand in a person says like one of those black buckets called that uses a bus tub or a jug of water over had I take a shower and then every morning morning program was to do hard on that means just walking through streets and chanting Hari Krishna me and this young Brahma cherry and we'd go to Tompkins Square Park
sit under the tree we read the Bhagavad Gita and then we can't hurry now I'm all the way back that was our morning rituals and
 one day it was out here we go and buy one of these big stacks of garbage and I heard the garbage rustling and sometimes you do cuz there's a rat in the garbage or something but all of a sudden a man jumps out
 the garbage pile and he's scared the heck out of us and he heard us chanting and he goes Hey where's the Swami it was like this homeless man living just sleeping on this garbage probably cuz I was like
 who you mean bhaktivedanta Swami you got the Indian Swami cuz we are right around from 26 2nd Avenue goes
 ecosia do I use icing with the Swami he died many years ago he goes
stop and he said you know I used to know the Swami I used to go with him all the way down this road to the park I used to help him carry big pots and feed people in the park that was really out of this world and then he said to me one day I was this is happening that you don't 5 a.m. in the morning and goes one day I was carrying this big I don't know what it was it was like syrup with these balls floating balls in it balls and when I got to the park and I put it down and you know what the Swami took one of those balls and put it right in my mouth
 incredible story and Swami just said here you go to problem I put a glove these people are still all around New York City a lot of interesting stories all right all right here's a
for today everybody is it from o by the way congratulations to Kelly Becker winner of the merch Monday oat bag are you all right
 when you realize there is no other things that I don't like Braum's from Lao Tzu to slow or not it's really short what do you do when you realize there is nothing lacking
 the whole world belongs to you the world could be yours
 you just have to realize that nothing is lacking and what we make of that make it the same thing like the Buddhist said his heart desires that caused our suffering in this world and inbox we get that desires cause our suffering but we refine it even more we say our material desires we distinguish because the the soul itself desires you can't just like you do
you know sometimes you try to catch a bug in the house without killing us you back up over it you just give it a couple more your desires because the salt wants to desire we just refine the desire so we say it's okay to desire Krishna desire I want to go to bring David I want to serve the devotees I want good Association I want to you can just say okay I'm not going to eat now cuz I desire food I want to eat food that's been offered to Christian there for all our desires are connected with our body and with our love you can't it's nice to think we could just snuffed them out you can't you can minimize him that's for sure but we still have desire so we say perfect our desire that shelter record Perfection of desire desire but nothing is lacking
 nothing is well because when the idea is that
we think by getting I'll be fulfilled but one with uncontrolled desires there's nothing you could give them that will fulfill them so desires are like a fire you blow on it it goes away right trying to fulfill your desires you blowing the fire goes down and then if flame is back up if Boy Scouts know this and I'm still lacking buyers but it seems like I'm still lacking you'll always be lacking if your desires are out of control
 you're always does so so what once you control your desires you realize there's nothing like that what I've got what I need here yeah
 who is allowed to by the way
 is a cording to Wikipedia is a semi legendary ancient Chinese pots with set volume is semi-legendary semi-electric PD has got an attitude
I need a music that we start a semi Legend like his Legend is kind of like half fictional and half of real or something
 oh maybe that's what I think it means but it's but the way it sounds like he's semi-literate like he's not quite a legendary status but he's almost there right but he's a semi legendary ancient Chinese philosopher who's the author of The Tao Te Ching
 it was just the foundational text 1000
 always been wise people very well actually I'm the cultures that lousy is a Chinese honorific typically translate is the old master that name doesn't translate well wowzee. See says he'll different but you know
 of
 the invitation to the issue punish a dome poornamadah up or not be done that you know
that's this the personality got it is perfect and complete and because he's completely perfect all emanations from him such as this phenomenal world the world that we live in is perfectly equipped as a complete hole
 and whatever is produced of the complete all is also complete in itself in others we think you don't like someone may be sitting in a prison saying all there's a lot lacking here you know like this
 there's no Freedom here now it is actually perfectly designed ideally it would be it's perfectly is not lacking anything it's designed exactly for where you're at you know and once you kind of realize it you realize that this is an asset right look. I think that's kind of the point is when we realized nothing is lacking when we realize that there's no external things that I need to be happy to be satisfied that all within me at that
everything in the world why do we have a lot or a little of external things it becomes our asset even the problematic Things become our ass head like and what's that the prison is an asset for the prisoner if it's reforming him
 and so when we realize that nothing's like and that realization is something that comes only like in a particular State of Mind in the bug of agita so clear on this ride like that
 if you go to the 14 chapter and we read about the different modes of nature the different influences three different influences that this world primarily, is throwing at us and we have to choose carefully like what we connect with because it influences us but if we can connect with that sucked faguna the motor goodness yeah and in the in the buggy to the 14th chapter the 6th text it says
 being sure the motor goodness disciple gonna
being pure than the others is Illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions from all your bad, those situated in that mode they become conditioned by sense of happiness and knowledge are they because Suka Suka Musik happiness Ease comfort
 you know contentment like that and knowledge it at the end when you're in that state when you're not hankering for something external
 then you can see things as they are and come the fever goes down and suddenly you know that sometimes seems like all hyped up and see if they take a few deep breaths and then they could be going to see okay there's a way out of this are okay it's not that bad in a but when you're all hyped up
 then you're confused it and in the next text 14-7 says it speaks of
 the rajakaruna the motor passion the motor passion is born unlimited desires
and longings of Arjuna and because of this the embody living entity is bound to fruitive actions it means we get we get caught up in the system with him and we actually in at least a misery you know your actions even activities or sports or hobbies that are in the mode of passion may not be evil or something but you know like the bright light the bright light was telling me you know she was like a Downhill Racing and I don't know what she did was his Prestige crazy skiing stuff I can see her ski jumping and you got to go you got to really hit the big one the big the big one
 yeah and nothing alike in the way big thigh bone but
you're like you never hear somebody will somebody will like you know I got a really bad gardening injury you know if those aren't coming up from the motor goodness you don't get some type of distress generally to the degree that they are passionate activities like I said not evil but if you see all these kids doing like BMX mountain biking really fast through the mountains up on curves
 it's fun in the more passion and therefore the payoff is there some distress there you break bones and what the speak of the mud pleasure in the mode of ignorance there's a even a bigger a bigger down and turn and it's not just like
 external like that but it's just like your Interstate right like when you when you are hankering for something that you don't suffer going to means I'm content everything's okay sure how would I win
the more passionate means like I'm not satisfied there's something that I don't have is something I got to get I'm not going to be satisfied until I get it and you never get satisfied you just keep need a rush to rush cuz that's the kind of thing that is nonstop reels about like people doing this that and I'm like and what sense is impressive in another sense what the hell you could have use that energy in such a better way you know how much time did you did you spend learning how to do that dumb trick I'm glad they did it I'm just way for you but when you're an adult it's kind of like that energy is meant to be engaged in some higher way now you know we were at this
 beautiful waterfalls and there was one like 10 years old I jumped off me and she jumped off into the beautiful clear River the the Mad River Creek
this one like 10 year old kid just climbed a cliff just a climate itself as like he's going to kill himself and he jumped off like barely escaping death bear in any tragedy happened it would have ruined everybody's day that I would have been traumatized watching I get traumatized and that's just like that's the game in the motor passion there's some there's some
 there's some results from the happiness in the world of passion and where is it it's often times in the mind often times that all the time it's for Annie go pay off like it would you do it if nobody was watching or maybe not
 okay
 what's a good what's a good pleasure in the motivator it's cuz diva
 well intoxication is if he wants to leave toxicants great pleasure sleep very pleasurable
dismantle your life okay thank you for that you think you can move on to the north when you get north of 50 Pleasures become different to buy tree identification bird identification let's go for a walk I just sleep last night I slept good goodness is pretty damn boring I will say but it's nice morning only if you're in the mode of passion let's go for another walk I was like okay I'm bored but I know this is good for me
 okay pull together and let's keep this moving forward
 good morning Rocco you're up early today and keep it going cuz here okay alright
the right on the musket Tienda Rancho Bernardo tell Mom David Watson. But I'm witches are very mean to Conquest when should I respectfully Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Rishi the super most human being on to mother's house party the goddess of learning and just real heavy ass today the author not step racial botheration hm. Okay talk to you about what a nice turkey but regular to Tom and Jerry service Lapeer devotees all that is troublesome the heart will become erratic hated and loving service the Supreme Lord he was raised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh My Gana done this year has been arranged my teachers are opening my eyes to the torch light of knowledge I got probation fees at their Lotus feet read it from the shoe and bag of times can 27 chapter 13 text 23 it's the story of the Python man
prolonged maharajpur lot is all grown up he's a king walking through the forest meets this side and then if I went out a particular side and here's to be sort of like this on home to man laying in the Lang on the grounds that disheveled than any inquires from him and he realizes that he could tell but the man starts speaking words of wisdom but you know what he does first is it a lot like tell me about yourself what are you all about you've got something I want to hear from you
 and yeah although it appears like
 like he wouldn't have anything to offer him merely because they speak in a very cultured way and it the first three verses he's just praising for lied again saying because you're engaged and cable abbate like analog devotion without any selfish desires whatsoever I can tell that's where you're at and because you're like that
you see everything you understand exactly what most people walk right past me they don't have a clue what I'm all about you cute you know right that you just going right in on me and and and he's going to have one more groceries prison for life and then he's going to start to drop the knowledge or not and drop it's yours puth on Manchester here's here's going to glorify prologue my dear King although you know everything you have to post some questions which I shall try to answer according to what I have learned by hearing from authorities there's always as idea that knowledge is descending it's not just like I'm very smart this way we haven't called her today we're very deep were very smart and we just speculating about the universe here he is a wise man but he's hearing this is what's coming down now it descends actually you know run was actually the word that its users Utah shooting
 which means like in this is something we've been talking about lately right it's like the shoot it shoot it means but you here but it also refer
to that which has been heard about the shooting and it means in contrast to like that's what it's been created she don't bite people is is that there's this vibration moving throughout the Universe and the Veda this knowledge and he's saying what I what I'm going to share with you is connected to that it's like it's not something I'm making up it's not something I wrote my own self-help book about these are my own my own commentary on the yoga sutras it's not that property rights this he says the words you taught shoot them refer to Vedic knowledge right that vibration that that Eternal virus The Vedas are known as trucchi
 because this knowledge is received from authorities the statements of The Vedas are the statements of The Vedas are known as Shruti pramana
 their proof themselves right there they're like Flawless knowledge one should quote evidence from the Shruti
The Vedas
 or Vedic literature and then once statements will be correct otherwise one's words will proceed from mental concoction so there's a just a different value placed on them you know part of this culture you can't just make the philosophical statement if you do someone has the right to say it will where'd you hear that front where you got that from. Where'd you get that from you can't well I just thought about it it's my own realization we do even the great Masters they'll speak but they'll reference it to well you know who spoke of this is also a commentary Prop Hunt Road
 I typically get to 7:15 which is the verse about the austerity of speech
 my people wise people are very careful about how they speak with words that use the affected it has where come from austerity speech consists in speaking truthfully and then officially ending in a
speech that offends the one should also recite The Vedas The Vedas regularly but here in the concert supposed to pick up the book a chance of Montrose and hit and that's there for sure but probably also takes it a step further in the come to resent to to recite The Vedas regular means what do you say should be connected to that which is to be the very truth right so this is what he writes he says one should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others that's one thing
 of course when a teacher speaks he can speak the truth for the instruction of the students in other words a guru may speak to her disciple in a way like hey we got a problem here you got to straighten up
 but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds this Penance as far as talking is cuz this is penance as far as talking he says it's broke
besides that one should not talk nonsense when speaking and spiritual circles 1 statements must be upheld by scripture
 one should at once quote from the Spiritual Authority to back up or you sang so this is that's that's the tradition that's what it means to speak in the yoga tradition did not just like you know people just throwing out any kind of new-age mumbo-jumbo you have to learn this stuff and if you say something with confidence when you have understood clearly from these sacred texts which are a vibration on a whole different level in this regard for the personality like you is just fit to be spoken to by one who desires self-purification
 another idea
where can I find the subtle body because of insatiable material desires isn't it the next the next 10 verse 11 versus these are all about the futility of trying to find happiness to external things been there done that check because of insatiable material desires
 I was being Carried Away by the waves of material nature's laws and dust I was engaged in different activities struggling for existence and various forms of life Sperrys for until I said this is a zoomed-out desire leads to another desire leads to another desire leads to transmigration into different bodies yeah well that's ultimately but even in this life even if you don't believe in you get another body and I mean if that sounds too lofty for you come on we could suggest what he saying here
I do understand what I'm saying that some people might drop into the show and like I don't believe in that oh yeah well unlimited desires causes pain anyway it's exhaustion its attacks resources time energy and and for what is it actually fulfilling or is it a hope to have some Joy it's not actually Joy necessarily it's a hope to enjoy
 you know I was just telling Mara this movie on a ranch but usually when I'm driving I start ranting about things but he's talking about getting sick of these like you need going to bike store to fix a flat or something and are trying to sell you you can take out this helmet is that thousands of different helmet thousands of different biking shirts thousands of different biking shorts that was different back of it I have to dress like a clown just a ride
my bike down the road give me a break and I'm sick of it and they try to sell you going to have this right boob hugging shirt I have to wear how did you say to him when he's like this. Okay. Me up
 now you're just like out here goes with the bicycling bicycling consumerism Elvis parsley to buy anything it's okay it'll grips at least have a gloves it's just to come give me a just let's ride a bike damn it still by give me the whole if I have this and I look cooler in their business
what's a business it's just like just lettuce
 I can't breathe I do buy some gloves but you could fall that's why I got them bicycling shorts I do but they pack my but I just I don't really helmet for your helmet of theirs okay practical bicycle shoes
 Uvalde and that's why you're so upset anyway it's a it's a thing all I'm saying is
 let's just work it out right here right now you feeling better I feel better
 so it doesn't even become about the bike ride anymore it's just the stuff that goes with it and then you never use it you know what it's true or not because when I came back and some people are moms and I need lots of stuff I don't know but listen to this when I came back
spent 5 months in India came back was mid-march still cold out
 and I said I need some gloves when I'm riding a bike not forget it that's a whole thing I just walked in the hardware store hardware for like three and a half bucks I got a great pair of gloves for it you know the only suitable everything's tak-tak you need and want to go hiking okay great you need these pants if you needed pants zippers on zip up the legs and people with their sweat sweat takes the sweat out of your body and puts them to come on man it's licking it off right now. But even people would look at those gloves that I'm wearing is a wild where to get those cool biking but they could have charged $45 for these gloves and you know it's not like that in the bike shop they had any kind of special expensive ingredients that they're using you know
 it's just
 if I can use it to paint the house you know
guess you were riding around the city bike with gardening gloves I wish I found that picture it works it works okay now so this point again was that he was saying what you saying but he was also saying from the zoomed out level who sent beforehand before you before I was in the condition I'm in now your people looking at me like I'm unfortunate actually I finally figured life out right I was transmigrating from one body to another it was desires that were causing the transmigration move me from one by each other over the course of Life times has the big zoom out it's not just like you're getting pulled around by your desires are coming to this hobby that hobby this guy this girl this apartment that home that long that car that's this lifetime then there's a bigger picture where you're actually your desires are creating
 weird to think of it like that but you know it's like your body a God or you don't like how
you chose right remember that right is that interesting to think you chose it. You chose this body by your choices that some people say all know I didn't why would I choose this body oh come on that's what you wanted but you only got you up to that level sometimes people overeat and they don't want to be heavy but you're overheating so you were choosing in a lot of ways the body that we get is some people want to choose a healthy body so they make choices that gives a healthy body so we're Choosing by our choices and so the body of a time is about redefining your choices for tomorrow and the next week the Seinfeld
 Kramer was I kind of posing as like a acting teacher
 in any case, the whole crowd around him if they're convinced I think I just connect the emotions to
I don't have to think of the emotional blue red who are you what are you doing because it's like this we're shifting right it's like I couldn't look at these desires that will ship ship ship ship so we're going like dog treat cow-itch platypus man want me to put the same as this in that cycle then you finally hit human and when you have to hit that humans staged that's the junction that the opportunity and that's what's going to talk about now the train station in the train can go in so many different directions that's the human birth you yeah you can really you got the opportunity to the best opportunity you're going to have to start to direct this yourself to break the cycle you know the interesting thing is in this lifetime whatever hobby you get into it's generally
like like for example bicycling it's generally a whole thing it's like going into a junk that has so many other doors or something cuz the ramp packing or dance or whatever you're into but you got to be careful about that initial first choice because there's a whole culture that comes with that Hobby and sometimes that culture won't necessarily sure your sattva Google is always a big choice that leads down to many more many more choices that's why it's so important this is one lesson I learned in life or Leon from good to help me a lesson Buddha particularly when it comes you can either call me loud see if you
 there are certain decisions you make in life that are the big junctures marriage obviously is one of them it's a big one you've with your dear.
patient the biggest yeah I'm going to choose them to work out and be here for the next 10-15 years this is a big decision right yeah sometimes you work then just can't get out of there sometime soon move locations we move from one place in the country to another only people come to changing locations where you going to look some people come to me is like you know what I've been working in the bar for 10 years and I got to get out of here. But I can I need the tips you know what to get a copy to get used to that standard of living but they don't like the environment and hear that a lot the workplace is a big one goes to buy like we're done with this whole thing and of course but keep Unity, you just you just keep up that rant I'm going to set you up for it okay to take a deep breath I'll take it for a second
 so when it comes to decisions in life particularly important Forks in the road that's where you want to get the blessings of the vice numbers that you
those people that are deeply spiritual that you say these are these are level-headed people with good Insight that I know care about me that I know have my best interest in mind that I know or seen this from the higher perspective than I can see it through their wisdom and due to their remove you know they were from being a step out of it my own vision of the decision may be clouded by my circumstances my desires they're going to be able to view this from Through The Eyes of shastra better than I am let me get their blessings let me see what they think about it very important big choices seek the blessings he was yes sorry I was such a reasonable excuse the chicken in the Hat was sitting on the chair
he left to get out of here for real came into your house to lay the egg laid an egg was just like sort of like just keeping it warm cuz I can't check the tide lifts them up and threw him out if you hear anything I said not really watching device not that Forks in the road big Forks are over there yes that's important whenever there's a Big Fork I said I'd call the cops who I respect that I trust and I say this is what I think what do you think I thought that was you just the other day did nairo going to
 call me off your blessings you said I need your blessings and I was like no I cannot do that it's illegal to do I don't know what you think it's joking he asked me deep philosophical I want to
showered blessings upon you and I synced it from others to I went around and you know people that were important this on the spot okay so human life is the junk unless you're with a python may have to say about this
 in the course of the evolutionary process which is caused by fruit of activities that statement alone we just ran is so thick and heavy listen again in the corner you translate fruit of activities first what is the meaning of The evolutionary process like where the soul is going in this world like some of you guys are gone play your up higher in the workplace okay in the course of evolutionary process your growing your your thinking different with sometimes we go down and are thinking process and then at the time of death were either going down or we're going up in the course of our evolutionary process where our Consciousness is that just cost you get that way it's caused by your fruit of activities
I'm working for this okay when you work for something that's called a fruit of a Christian thing external material pleasure in life in prison life with a fruit at the end of it
 due to and what it is due to undesirable
 material sense gratification I think I need something external satisfy my senses I've received this human form of life which was he saying he got had bad desires and he saying that I got stuck in the system because of my fruit of desires and then that's system is sending you through a human body so I went down and then the system gradually evolves you back up to human okay that's where he is now
 hello
yeah okay you're like a notorious now that's what he said was that tell you going to continue the first I have received the form of life which can lead to have any planets to Liberation to the lower species or to rebirth among human beings okay so when he was in the dog body those options when opening he's just going to evolve to the next level when he was in the tree body he can't he can't choose go to Hanley play at The Liberation he's just going to go up the next step is like a automatic system but when you get to the human or that's the junk sure that's where you can that's where you've got the power in your hands to decide where you're going to go now just to pop the bubble of those who are new to the show and new to this understanding of reincarnation don't start thinking while I want to be a bird I want to be a swan I want to be I want to be a dub you do not want to be a dove what do you have to turn
people on too so that this will be very clear one simple Instagram account yard and it sometimes you'll see a hawk hunting birds you want to be a bird or just study they live in a constant state of fear even if let me tell you I love you I don't know if you saw this nature is metal clip the other day brother

 sitting in a tree there's a hole in the tree and the snake going into the hole that bird is watching that snake go right into the hole where its eggs are or its children yeah and starts packing up a snake it's too late the snake's head is in there and it's eating the snake was a hole in the hole then the snake comes out of the hole it's already too late it he's packed packed the snake out of
then the Beast dragged the snake to the bottom and then the snake kills him everybody dies
 what happened was that snake wrapped around that bird and held it on the ground
 I like was going to eat it but it was already so full from eating that snake from that Bird's children

Going on with the pipe yeah he's lying is exactly he's fine at they come in they just kind of dropped them stay in here I please hear don't even use the microphone unless you give them the microphone for next week or we don't know his name is Colin the python guy and then I was going through species after species in this you know chain of birth and death based on my previous choice is my fruit of activities have been going up and down and then I reached the human form of life where I had the choice
 to determine whether I'd be born next has an animal or whether I go to the Heavenly planets or
whether it be liberated or take birth as a human again I reach that stage and what is the end that now tomorrow we'll go he's asleep then I begin to preserve begin to look at humans get a look at how they live see where it goes see what they strive for to find happiness see if it actually delivers it and I look closely at it
