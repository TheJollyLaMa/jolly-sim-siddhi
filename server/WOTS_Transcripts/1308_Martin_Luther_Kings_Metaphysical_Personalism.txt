 yep we have back to Recovery Group meetings today at 1 to 9 p.m. eastern time we also meetings in person in my apartment Alachua Nashville and New York City we're doing it at 7 a.m.
 it's good all right we're going to start off a little nugget today and this is an interesting nugget from get you to do
 American reacts to the King dr. Martin Luther King
 I got more than this nugget Burger not that I can you got more than the snuggle up there and I'm more than just a Luther King so so shall we do a little nugget a little piece of philosophy this would have has to do with the verse we're going to
in the course of the day in the course of our reading but we just show how sword of truth is universal and comes from different sources and sometimes those truth there's a Venn diagram with troops slime if it's true that will line up perfectly
 with bated teachings so here's Dr Martin Luther King he says I studied personalistic philosophy the theory that the clue to the meaning of Ultimate Reality is found in personality this personal idealism remains today my basic philosophical position personalism insistence that only personality finite and infinite is Ultimate real it is ultimately real strengthen me into convictions one it gave me metaphysical and philosophical grounding for the idea of a personal God
 and they gave me a metaphysical Bass
are the dignity and worth of all human personality is pretty pretty powerful yeah I read more days but it just right here that I think you know what a lot of us will find it most significant
 is this last line where you know is it's gave him a metaphysical and philosophical grounded for an idea of a personal God okay that's your theological belief your face whatever you want to call her
 but then he says how that Faith plays out in the world and he says he gave me a metaphysical basis not not a not dumb that this is grounded in something that you know his his idea his basis for his idea that every human being
 has inherent dignity and inherent worth is grounded in this metaphysical idea that there's a person
and everything and the end in that we are all persons in relation to that person this quote goes over further this is from I suppose a speech or an essay that he wrote called where do we go from here
 he says the image of God is universally shared in equal portions by all men
 every human being has reached into his personality the indelible stamp of the Creator every man must be respected because God loves him the worth of an individual does not lie in the measure of his intellect is racial origin or his social position
 these are what we call the party's decision of the yoga terminology right false designates temporary designation temporary designations ultimate real real in the early quote where he said
he said that I study the person listed philosophy philosophy
 the theory that the clue to the meaning of the Ultimate Reality is found in personality right like with the real these temporary things are in a sense unreal
 but the Ultimate Reality is found in the person behind everything the person behind everybody is a soul that's animating and make it come alive and then if you go further back you find that there's an original person that as he's he's referring to nearest that needs to create a right every man must be respected because God loves him
 the worth of an individual does not lie in the measure of his intellect is racial origin or social position human worth lies in relatedness to God and it thrown it down on the bottom of the data, that there are many Eternal beings are many conscious beings but they are all dependent they're all connected
all intrinsically connected to that one
 whenever this is recognized we're at this kind of thing that we're all connected to one Divine Source whenever this is recognized whiteness and Blackness pass away as determinants in a relationship and son and brother are substituted nicer when we recognize our connection and everyone's connection to that one then we recognize that we're all connected to each other
 it's amazing how in in bhakti philosophy and lifestyle we raise that bar even a little higher cuz we're seeing personality in plants and trees and animals and it's not just the pigment of our skin which was like everything he was facing and and working towards smoothing out but now the snow
where the world is turning now that there's all these other living beings have dignity and we should give dignity cuz they have some worth and this is the vision of the yogis that everything is a living being struggling to survive and therefore we treated with dignity and love and not only the skin color or pigment in pigment Etc is secondary
 but the species itself as secondary and this is this is how it why the Yogi's tread lightly in this world because we realize we don't want to cause pain to any living being and just and then did we get to this point of accepting that just to exist were causing pain so we realize you can't be an absolutist about this to there is we want to travel as lightly as we can't leave the smallest footprint as possible on this planet and it's sort of
our philosophy is not that just got is a person and I'm a person or that guy's a person I'm a person another human beings are persons but that personalities behind everything and that's a very beautiful thing because that way we get to smash away any differences because how do we find connection or Unity it's got to be in a more subtle level than our body our skin color are species are race or gender or gender preference it's got to be more and more more subtle it's not mental it's not intelligence those things will never be equal right Mara smarter than me
 you know
 but it's got to be on something much more subtle Unity can't unity and connection can't be done on any other material platform we're just not that there are are unity or equality no one's equal winds are not equal but at the same time the spirits that's where we find our commonality and that's where we find
next when you find commonality is you treat each other with in a special way with a type of dignity that type of respect and we realize that because we're all Cut From the Same Cloth wrap Heart Of God therefore we actually have a lot in common with everybody everybody's going through the same things that we're going through we're going through gain and loss or going through betrayal heartbreak Falling in Love Gaining wealth losing well we're getting old or getting some disease from chronic disease are as different as we are we're so similar in so many ways and we learn to live with people it and instead of breaking into different tribes that are repulsed by each other and try to find where I tribe is better we learn to find that we learn to find some commonality in it in the living beings
 and that's why I think it's important to work with plants and animals
 you start to see their personhood
 behind
furry face
 Abacus tuba looking at the person who behind your furry face it don't judge me for my furry face now that that is you know
 he's Martin Luther King is he saying that
 my beliefs that are playing out in in his work
 and his relationships where they had a metaphysical basis okay so then let's let you know what what was Bhagavad Gita and she was Bob and Tom and the punishers excetera laying out as a metaphysical basis for understanding how we can relate to the source of every living being and relate to every living being and when we in the deeper you go into that like the the tighter the focus gets it away, is the kind of thing that you can focus in tight and then you expand the view as well right so so you
Jason from Braman realization that God is everything to power Mama realization that behind all the workings of the universe there's there's this extension of the Divine in every living being right conscious and arranging and in the end you know 13 chapter the buggy to get sent all this right witnessing but also the permit the overseer you know that that that there's an that creating the network that moves is incredibly intricate universe
 and then if you tighten the focus still more you find that that poor mama is an expansion of one being that that manifested unlimited ways but it all goes back all to lie to a person it's still and so Christian them in the bag of kitties going to say that tightening of the focus that is what we call the confidential aspects of a Down To The Greatest Secret and all of the shysters and all of the sacred text has to do with under
find all there's that person and Martin Luther King of saying when I understood that it may be understanding them then he can wide and then you can kind of again wide scope how that helps me see everything and everyone and and how should that work not in the sectarian why not I've understood God you don't understand. God is in my church not in your temple whatever know it did that you begin to see them the presents in the energy of that God in everyone and then it and everywhere
 and it should be a healing thing it should be it should be something that that heals conflict rather than creates conflict would love to see Christians take this seriously about animals
 you know I'd like to see personhood in his just questions I think everyone right but now I will I'd like to see Christians because are already believe in God
and then be like oh well that's the point they're actually every so often times that I've I find with Christians and somebody something we have some Christians on the show I find that they have this person putting God at a person Hood in and humans but everything else and in a person hunting Christ but everything else is just sort of
 mechanical mundane rent an n n n n n n n n a a weeping willow tree that would be considered paganistic are you believe in all these other gods or the polytheistic but it's not it's at that everything is Spirit but there is one Divine spirit is one source of all spiritual entities that this metaphysical basis
 what is going to show is that actually the entire universe is one big body right than the universe itself is a is a living body and it has a soul and that's it and that's all
the same part of Mama did the Same Soul within my heart and in your heart and within the heart of the dog and within the heart of the tree
 did you get the tree had a heart attack if I would have ran over to the church with in the tree nets is the same Universal Soul represented in unlimited ways just as an example sometimes giving us if you have many parts of water and the sun is shining down than the sun is represented within every pot is so that universal soul is represented within is there is present within the heart of everyone and every living being and not so you know we should ideally see that this there's an evolution that's meant to take place as one goes into deeper spirituality and it's a situation right of like I don't you see. Just in my church or just in my set
 but as one mature as one really becomes in the contacts with the true substance the true spiritual substance or the true person behind it
then it's meant through the practices the meditations the rituals that the teachings of the text the example of those who practice it is meant to was meant to open myself up to to the transformative contact of that and mature from the sectarian view that send it on like external religious symbols which we call kanishka Eddie Cartwright like that the neophyte spiritualist of the mosque but we see these other people as different from me yes what one is instructed that as quickly as possible when it's meant to mature from that immature spiritual vision and and try to come to the intermediate level where you begin to have the ability to recognize Divinity more broadly
 unimpeded by sectarian judgments
right okay I see that the same Divine force behind everything that I recognized in my temple is also there in that church
 and in the heart of every living being and actually goes beyond species write it so it's also in the other species II but I can recognize that energy it it's will get into the versus because I'm there's a lot of
 there's a lot of what food colitis he's going to give for versus here right his father asks us ask him one fundamental question where do you get your strength right I'm so powerful everyone's afraid of me you're you're a little kid and you're speaking to me and in such a disability at way where do you get your strength at it as my friend I've been trying to kill you I hope you're having trouble doing it where do you get your strength from he's Furious but he's demanding to try to understand this and provide speaks for
verses to the minutes just such a wealth of of information and end
 and I'm
 wisdom in what he says
 okay where did he run texted I didn't do the prayers are morning prayers as I told you before he started to shoot my Bobbitt on witches are burning means a conquest when should offer is back to the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan on turn on Rishi mother saraswathi the goddess of learning and she will be off today if the author messed up right now by regular Tennessee classes in the baggage, by rendering service De Pere devotees all that is troublesome of the heart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transcendental songs will be established as an
look up a fact oh my God that's a teacher's open my eyes of the torch light of knowledge offer obeisance he's after Lotus feet reading from the shoe cobbler times can 27 chapter 8 txstate he opened up with text someone we just read that quickly again just to get the flow the question was by whose power has a rascal like you become some so impudent that you appear fearless and overstep my power to rule you that's what is just a lot of him how's it going so powerful her know he's speaking to his father my dear King the source of my strength I wish you were asking is also the source of yours indeed the original source of all kinds of strength is one
 he's not he's not only your strength or mine
but the only strength for everyone without him without him and then we can get any strength weather moving or not moving Superior or inferior everyone including Lord Vermont is controlled by the strength of the Supreme personality of godhead okay all these Shakti is all these powers are ultimately coming from God and they walked in and it's not that I have a power source and you have a separate power source that someone else they've got their own power that they developed on their own he's saying you know proper to use this to help explain as used in the comments are the example of the Sun that the same heat you know that the fire the heat that you find within a log and the heat that you find within a piece of coal in the heat that you find Whitney and all these different sources of Fire
 that they're all coming from one common source the sun here you know not that I you know
 understand Sanskrit in Poetic so well but you can see that
the power of the Poetry in this Percy says nikhila me about estrogen survival evolved aberration not only no cable or may not only in me
 right Bob attached garage on but also in you okay survival mbali now that did the the the bomb the strength it's in me
 is also he says balam balam the strength of the strong the strength of anyone that has strength to powder eashum going to strengthen our lockers is coming from that one source okay so it's it's it's a type of thinking that's just dumb
 elusive to his father he's a serious he's going to go
continue with this message
 You're such as the strength is its the strength but with the individual does with that string
 like anybody everybody has some type of gift from the personality of godhead we're born with some quote god-given gifts how we use them that's where our Free Will and if we're taking our gifts and not giving back with those gifts
 this is a big problem and you could say the whole round me on is on this principle which is Hanuman the pure devotee is taking the gifts he's taking Sita who is Shakti herself and giving her back to ROM taking that taking taking seats and giving back to Rob Rob and who's also powerful Mystic Yogi's taking Sita for himself whenever we take our gift and use it for our ego we create Havoc we create hell and whatever we take our gift and use it in service
that's when everything becomes quite perfect in this world when you deny it see what would Martin Luther King was saying is he saying I've got this metaphysical basis
 and it's affecting how I relate every living being how understanding how I see them
 when you deny that Source when you didn't when you deny that that every living being is connected to One Source that energizes them all gives them all the life
 and then you deny that what I have my strength or as your same kind of like my gifts what I have to offer in this there's nothing from there's no one
 for me for in which I am I should feel gratitude so that whole element of gratitude is eliminated right Martin Luther King is saying I'm grateful for whatever I can do for my voice for my intelligence for my life for my ability I have a sense of gratitude to the purse
behind it all that gives me all of this when you say this is all just develop out of a random you know it's an explosion of chemicals that there is no then there's no one for which to feel grateful to
 and now your metaphysical basis is completely warped you know okay let's let's let's hear it
 Colossus the Supreme person of godhead who is the Supreme controller and time factor is the is the power of the senses the power of the Mind the power of the body and the vital force of the senses his influence is unlimited he is the best of all living entities the controller of the three loads of material Nature by his own power he craves his Cosmic manifestation maintains it and annihilates it also
okay so yeah so here it begins each photo write his image of these for now in the yoga sutras
 you know when it is it speaks of each for a right which literally means the controller
 what is commonly used to refer to God
 and when when do yoga sutras defines who is he for what is he trying to start by saying Peru Shiva Shay Shay a special person like it's a person but it's a special person why is special because it's the person that all the other persons are dependent on its the life that is a source of all of their life it is the energy that energizes and it's a personal energy that energizes every other person so here is saying that the old jaw strength of the senses is so hot the strength of the mind the bollocks the bodily strength the indria all of the senses of the body
just like you know you have a we have a microphone here or you have a speaker
 they can't do anything until you plug them in to the energy source right so simply our eyes our ears are aren't you know our our capacity to smell or to feel you know texture or to taste this have no ability to do what they do they have no power unless they're plugged into the power source a lot of saying my power source is the same as your power source there's one power source behind it always the East part of the special person behind it all
 Anakin kills continue text 9 so this is prologue speaking my dear father please give up your demonic mentality do not discriminate just means to discern in your heart between enemies and friends don't discriminate
and what, is it
 make your mind equipoise towards everyone
 powerful statement for the uncontrolled and misguided mind in this world everyone on the platform of equality one then comes to the position of worshiping the Lord perfectly it seems like that should be okay that's easy it's not easy that's why there's all these process we go through that's why we have like deity worship it's not so you just worship God in a in a stone or a carving you start to expand that to all living beings are process is a process to actually create this you can't artificially so yes I respect everybody the same we actually have a methodical systematic approach to actually getting
mine there and it's it's not that cheap it's a very very high high bar
 it is this versus so first of all let's put it all in context right there many of the back of a piranha is a collection of so many different stories are told and this is one of the most famous
 and were it's the tension is building up for chapters now right like chapters are go for launch started speaking on this watch you like I don't get this whole thing about friends and enemies I don't see the world that way I've heard that there people that think this way now I'm hearing people speak this way this is a very alien idea to me it's actually not philosophically sound I won't see that way now you know his father became upset by that at first he tried to have the teachers corrected the teachers tried
a lot came back with same message he tried to kill him
 I tried it all these different ways somehow mystically they they just couldn't pull it off then the teachers advise let's just so you know this project phase will pass through it it wasn't a face as a matter of fact I got worse cuz he started kind of convincing all of the other students in the school of the same kind of thinking now they brought him before his father again and he's saying the same exact stuff you know he's giving the same message
 and he's giving the the the as Martin Luther King was saying that the metaphysical basis for behind it all right I'm empowered by one person you're empowered by that same person the people that you consider your enemies like in draw and all the neighbors you know they're also empowered by that same where all the sons you know what that's what Martin Luther King said he was it again.
last line of that he said human worth lies in the relating it to God and individual has value because he has value to God whenever this is recognized whiteness and blackness in a friends and enemies it passes away as determinants in a relationship and what is it substituted by son and brother right we begin to see every living being is related so probably just saying since we all come from the same Source since you and I we are both blind our senses have no power without the same Source lighting up my eyes letting up your eyes the strength in our bodies all of this is coming from that one person so I can't see the way that you see I can't see that it is an end and this is so big that that line
 I would just so love to see a really high quality production of this you know
and to see the fury
 when polite says the statement it's such a powerful life-transforming statement but it must have just completely angered his father that except for the uncontrolled and misguided mind
 there's no enemy in this world right we only have one and it in other words
 the idea that there is any living being that I have a an intrinsically hostile
 relationship with
 that doesn't exist in reality it exists only in my mind
 right behind the workings of my mind and it when we go into the realm of reality there's nothing but Harmony because everything's connected to that one source it's only within this this back of him thinking that we have
does that concept you know it it's only to mine that's on controlled by the wisdom of the Sacred texts and misguided by external sources of information that one conceives that I have an enemy in this world it's a powerful powerful sentence
 you know there's something all so beautiful in people
 are grateful they're grateful for what they have their preciate what they've been given they let you know it and there's something very beautiful in that when people think like well I've got what I got because I burned it. Cuz I've worked hard for it I've got what I've got we've got what we've got by the mercy of other people and when we start to accept that everything is actually the mercy of another it changes everything and what a beautiful called and what a beautiful culture that is is something very very ugly about
not wanting to accept that your power your your source of opulence is coming from something else right now that I should get fired if we go into the free dip into the, turn your property rights as he says we create enemies and friends according to the dictation of the mind but actually there are no enemies and friends now we begin quotes to versus from Bhagavad Gita suspended to some of the show that the wise see with equal vision
 and he says some a survey shoe bootie shoe mud bog them levitate for them which is a
 8 what is it 1854
 being equally disposed towards every living being one comes to the pure state of buck t.i. blood buck 10 levitate for them this is all connected to you know cuz the birth of the verse he wrapped it up I say when one sees
everyone on the platform of equality when one has that metaphysical basis of how to see everyone
 he then ties it back into the religious thing one then comes to the position of worshiping the Lord perfectly right without that understanding there's the religious externals aren't the important thing is this clear metaphysical basis is clear understanding
 every living being right I just seen equally now you only then is one capable of you can say wash meat you can say pleasing of working hard relating harmoniously being in harmony with God so so so we put those two versus just so you don't like
 I really appreciate what you're saying it's always trying to understand it stepping back and understand what lies behind
I'd like what lies behind you know if there's a light bulb is lighting up a room
 is it weird if I come across from the light bulb is Goshen light bulb light bulb get the power light bulb you know a wiser person gets it you know there's got to be a generator behind it right and where does that generate like that to you have a generator and it's it's fueled by call
 well where did the call you do get its energy from I got it from the Sun you know a.m. to take it back and let you know this cat is a level you a lot of skipping some levels right cuz where do we get the power of the senses we say comes from the day but has the vision for vision comes from the god of the sun and selling but what are those damn is get their power they get the dog from Ultimate from this noon who is western expansion Christian Hinduism is to worship that Shakti that power to get some to get some power so I'm worship
the shocking worshipping the day bus and then Davies and I get some power and the Bhagavad Gita Krishna sort of crushes that idea so it's okay you can worship them but you should first understand it's all coming from me their powers are also coming from me and probably says here to to recognize that to recognize the quality of every living being based on that he said he writes to understand this is the preliminary condition
 for entering into the kingdom of devotional service for entering into the realm of bhakti that's it it's based on this
 metaphysical understanding but you know if we can say understanding but actually the realization right that that I not just understand it theoretically but that I really understand it
 sorry that that last line is when one sees everyone on the platform of equality one then comes to the position of worshipping the law
perfectly Thomas RV shoe bootie shoe wide bottom of a tapir
 it therefore you know there's no room for hate as well there's no room for hate and even like when we when we you and I are ministers or preachers of the holy name and when you go into a conversation with someone you meet we are we are searching out some common ground they might say a bunch of crazy things and we're overlooking it and going right for some common ground that we can hold on to and from that Common Ground then we can start expanding the teachings of the bug of agita but first there's got to be some common ground so we're against searching for the commonality the world gets hung up on our differences and creates hate and that becomes just like a damn in the in the river to flow there can't be it can't be any flow in life if we're always going after how we are different
nobody will look for the commonality and find something we have in common with someone and then start sharing the philosophy from that and if you believe in animal rights you believe in animals are living beings okay we got that all animals are Spirit Souls you know you believe in unity that you'd be leaving the other doesn't matter what race you are yes we have to because we're all Spiritual Beings you believe its source and higher power yeah we believe that same thing find what we have in common
 is it it's yeah he's saying that if you can't find that it sets your mind has been misguided you know and we see that of course that people influence others you know why do people take on hostile ideologies
 I think they become influenced by someone who generally has something to do with their own sense of identity right and then and then we become missguided and we get lost there for he called it he said these are monogatari Krishna in the
look at the causes mono gotten
 a metal concoction generated in the mind and there's there's a in the second chapter is this first 255
 a Christian says when a person gives up all varieties of of desire for such gratification when they realize that it's nothing externals going to give me happiness and it says that these desires he caused a moderate on which will rise out of mental concoction there's no truth in them it's just something that exists only in my mind you know he says when one's mind is less purified and one find satisfaction in the self alone right actually my nature is happiness my nature satisfaction then they're said to be a transcendental, to remind is concocting you need this to be happy and as soon as your thing like that you're thinking this person is my friend if they're satisfied that would this person is my enemies if there if there
anyway interfering with that external happiness but all of this just exist in the mind it has no true existential reality it's just thoughts passing through the mind not a good time so good price of this is text 10/10 in former times there were many fools like you would have his father took that one did not conquer the six enemies that steal away the wealth of the body these balls were very proud thinking I have conquered all the enemies in the 10 directions
 but if a person is Victorious over six and amazed at his equipoise towards all living entities for him there are no enemies enemies are merely imagined by one in endurance this reminds me of Richard Kipling how we must have just run into these sages in like wow this is recording and well you think they have
running at the sages and people are ascetics and detach and then like it must have blown his Western way of thinking like oh I get it there's another type of success we have this material metric of what successes what is actually genuine success this is all these verses can I get rid of the concept of friends and enemies and to see you and equipoise with everyone's part of God
 here is what a relief when you're walking around when you have no enemies no anger no people and no resentment in your mind what peace then you have the real wealth here it's just as we were just saying that it's a it's a loser e to think that my happiness will be derived from any external Source I must look within to find happiness which is my nature here again we're getting an indication the rather looking without look with an icy enemies without don't see the enemies without look within and find them
he's within a dimension 6 and their two groups of six that are spoken of when we speak of the six enemies and probably speaks of them both in the commentary you want to I want to read that
 when he read it
 Propst real of prepared rice in this material world everyone thinks that he has conquered his enemies
 just think of the enemy said I mean the person that he's saying this to
 current Akashi poo
 he was a person Imagine The Pride that he took in conquering external enemies right in jurong Island all the Davis
 as well as he thought himself is the most self discipline man you know like
 look at the deadly mantis Terry said he performed you know he say I am the man that knows how to conquer enemies nobody conquers enemies better than me
 okay so probably writes in this material. Everyone thinks that he has conquered his enemies not understanding that is ended
are his uncontrolled mind and five senses restaurant in three on a property Sonny Carson it's probably the quote that we're struggling with the six senses which include the mind
 in this matter so that's one group of six of the five senses the five knowledge acquiring senses in the in the mind which is the center of the mall
 and then it goes on in this material world everyone has become a servant of the senses originally everyone is a serving of Krishna but an ignorance one forgets this and this one is engaged in the service of Maya Evolution through Lusty desires and it hears the next 6 plus he desires angry delusion Madness and jealousy everyone is actually dependent on the reactions of the material laws but still want thinks himself independent and thinks he has conquered all directions in conclusion one who thinks he has many enemies
is an ignorant man or as one who's in Krishna Consciousness knows that there are no enemies but those within oneself the uncontrolled mind and senses if you really opt into this if you really feel like yeah that's me I don't I don't have any enemies yes what Christian if you're sincere Christian is going to start sending you
 enemies Chris is going to start having people do things to you in your life that would be like wait a second why would you do that to me who are you who do you think you are and he's going to put you in the situation where you're going to have to actually work these things out untie the knots of our mind we might be in a place right now we're like them got no enemies in my life well maybe you're not so once you get sincere in your bhakti the universe starts to throw people at you that I just hate you that you out that burn you down and take potshots at you then accuse you of things you're not even guilty of not
because they're bad people it's because Krishna wants us to really start to polish it's like we have this tarnished gold piece of silver and we want to just holla shit how about you to make it shine and that's what we're working on it that's why all of our work is internal work all of our work is how can I raise my standard even higher don't think that all these external things coming at me or against me they're actually completely for me there for my Evolution Krista is sending you things just happen to devotees when they become really sincere you start throwing them hurdles he starts throwing them glue traps to get stuck in and when I want to get frustrated everything we have internalized it off it sounds really great me saying this right now but the real test is when I get caught in a glue trap myself am I doing this in my MMI starting to shift my mind or my lashing out at others when I want to lash out at others
I know that I've been tricked I've been I know I'm off my spiritual trajectory and I'm starting my car is off the my tires are caught in the mud on the side of the road
 okay thank you for that so those are the four forces from colliding before yesterday just wanted to mention that yesterday great so passed on ever meet him I only one time only one time but he was a person that he met sure the profit in 1968 I believe in Montreal he was he was like you know like a student in Delhi and then went to school in in Montreal I guess he was attending to have a job in the advertising agency you know in an advertising agency in the early on you know as a married man he was
 very
damental in in the development of of the origin of Bucky spreading in the western world to know gave his life to show a profit by it eventually he took some your ass and he became one of the most influential spiritual leaders in India Modi just released a whole statement you know Noel praising him in and so on and do a truly a life-giving selflessly you know what area breast over 50 54 years ago something that 35 years ago in my Prop Hunt and Casey just gave everything you know beautiful beautiful example surrender you have a very impressive and our love goes out to all of the disciples had so many students all over the world with especially in India but
 very impressive this is this is going to be a powerful decade because a lot of these people really promoted Krishna Consciousness especially in the western world where there was a
there's nothing it was just like Baron you know they're all getting up into their late seventies and eighties and it's going to be a Whole Decade of Tears we're going to go through this great souls are departing this world good cuz it's a new week we need some good takeaways for the week
 are worth doesn't lie in our temporary designation lies in our intrinsic connection to God I like that quality happens on the spiritual platform that's real equality anyway everything else is false equality set the spiritual level
 we are meant to mature and transform to recognize Divinity without sectarianism
not quite the T-shirt but anyone t-shirt I would have I would have I would have read that how you use that god-given gifts are free will
 all right this is a good one we have no enemies except are uncontrolled misguided mind that's a baseball hat thing that we created baseball hats in America that's one thing we got go eat with credit baseball hats like no one had baseball hat before us did we create them personally didn't create them American I don't think they were anywhere else in the world
 good point. Thank you for that thank you everything everything we've got
 realize it's all coming from God to enter the spiritual Realm
before baseball hats
 why don't you worry a truck base balls around before trust and there's no room for hate
 once you're sincere Krishna sends you animes
 that have nothing to do with baseball what would they be wearing if it wasn't for the baseball cap
 I sure be some other kind of calf Mara and
 all the hurdles and glue traps are for our Evolution maybe we're like like like like I have a Kubota hat or a Ford hat what would that be a derby if it wasn't for baseball caps
Let It Go rather than other hat would I have warrant
 floppy disk people wear hats yeah they're all kind of hats rest I figure out if it wasn't visors weed where we were fishing hats we maybe we don't have like you know like that ACDC hat
