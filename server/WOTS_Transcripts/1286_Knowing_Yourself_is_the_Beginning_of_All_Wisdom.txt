 forgetting
submit American to some garden design and going to grow
 we're going to try to make a whole edible backyard that's the whole idea if I edible by human beings
 hey I hopefully not just the various rodents oh yeah it's crazy in this house because my daughter got like six little birds yesterday but I have my own Wildlife thing yesterday you just had wildlife in New York I heard it's getting New York in a little while lately and it was wild as you know I went out early in the morning at do Chapel walk sometimes in the park and there's that area called the ramble ramble yeah I know the ramble and we used to go to the ramble because it was just so seedy the Rambo people lived in the rainbow
there is all kind of stuff going on but I know it's good you're not at all nice and all along you were thickly wooded area but just like you do paved Trails through it but what did you see I saw coyote coyote mix with a regular dogs and they have there
 you sure like mangy scrawny old dogs
 this was like a powerful looking coyote and I just Roman loan you know it's like a lone wolf it was big as it was big I was telling you this story bigger and better that I actually like what it was like a lone wolf out there and we connect it
but it was nice it was it was it was we had a little connection or two of us alone out there just to look at each other all those all you are you safe are you going to hurt me you put up your pinky put up his paw
 I think I see a coyote in the middle of Manhattan like that. That is cool it's completely like what do I do with my life is like trying to get there how many block generation Generations
 I think so know they probably came down through the woods to Westchester and ended up there the whole way to the Ralston Road holy to Harlem in the whole way there was like a some strange animal in New York few years ago what was it that they're all trying to track down and catch
 remember that what was that private coyote or something
well you saw it I mean there was a great hike yesterday we hiked up by one of the Sacred Shaker mountains did you see any wild animals
 no didn't see any while I was ready to see a bear though cuz they're all coming out of hibernation now maybe feel a little bit like you know made me contemplate to the life of the the mendicant you know like you wander through the forest and there's animals there and you did makes you really have to come to terms with the philosophy that we talked about not being afraid that there's a part of Mama within this animal and
 you know I'm saying if you have to be so Fearless that have put your faith in God to wander alone in the four yellow a good that faith is when you see like an actual tiger that's the thing that's what I'm telling you, just cougar just killed somebody this week in California mountains
latest update on animal attacks are of wild animal wild elephants
 I'm not sure if I saw there now that I had a wonderful trip when I arrived in dehradun and took that ride I was it felt really good to be up in that area feels great until you see those signs

 the song the only one I've seen the songs which I have no choice a long time there so quick
the conscious they like super duper Krishna conscious they were meant to say explain Krishna Consciousness to people who don't know anything about Krishna Consciousness so it's sort of like reading you know introduction books on spirituality and you're taking him right out of the books yeah right out of the books and reflect where my mind was at when I wrote these things yeah it was actually a lot of reflection on your on your paths in this life lately right as writing the book doing the songs
 do you got any ended up right where I told you that
 I told you if I for the show I took it that microphone off to the side you're halfway off the camera and I'll bring it in in the middle and ideally back off a little from the cameras are not looking straight up your nose that you go back are you going to the Brooklyn Joe by the way

Just be there do you want to set up a wisdom of the sages table or something like that I work the table if you want we have a shelter table when you work that he does not want to watch the shelter table like I want to watch the wisdom of the ages table let me let me do my saver what are you going to do what are we working
don't we have stuff I don't think so we had some t-shirt so used to
 we don't have a ride together. Linda Linda Linda we got to figure that all that stuff that goes back to Recovery Group meetings today at 12 and 9 p.m. eastern time and then because we're traveling there's no show Tuesday and Wednesday and then Thursday and Friday we're going to be back on at 3 p.m. eastern time 3 p.m. screws everything up in bed by then I got to wake up early and 64 rounds Thursday and Friday I'll show tomorrow and the next day that's going to be hard crazy

 and that was that was good today before we went to India we did that podcast there like a couple fan shelter Fanboys I didn't know that why's that
you know he grew up a screw up in the New Jersey Oaks have Bowl community so it's like he's the only music they let the kids listen to go to shelter you know there are like a strict Sonic diet
 okay seriously though I have to mention Italy again Italy is happening and we want y'all to come if you look at it it's it's it's kid friendly my kids are coming other kids are coming we want you to come and there's some space left but we try to make it as excellent as possible if you want to get away for the summer and you think will might want to be in total Maya come with us it's Maya and it's also not, it's not my it's very quick but if you're in a beautiful backdrop of a place where people vacation to so check out our Italy a very reasonably priced good wisdom to stages.com and check that are Italy is it up there
yeah it's up there so it's got down in the Stream about the time we got another purse
 Monday come on run ask wake up
 get with it we're supposed to the show at 8 today yeah but you didn't tell me or the right time
 is there a little grumpy a little a little girl be a little tired see that
 it's hard to be in a band and nobody said you know It's a Long Way to the Top If you want to rock and roll rock and I know he said it's going to be easier okay
 all right there's a price from Aristotle knowing yourself
 is the beginning of all wisdom is knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom I think it's safe to say that a lot of people on this path
 they go through a
and initial purging it it's almost like it's excitement cuz there's knowledge and there's information in a culture so beautiful
 and then there's if they're sincere there's a virgin and the purging is Christian starts holding a mirror up in front of your face and shows you like you've been presenting yourself like this all these years for your ego
 but there's a real you this other thing is not you this is your pretentious self when you start getting that Glimpse it becomes ugly how much we're just put it on shows for people and so part of like self-realization we sound so beautiful and such a lovely is self-disgust self-hatred well it is discussed in how I've been living inside my whole life and I start to it real
this isn't me that's not me I can't believe I was showing off this part of myself and I thought this was so special about me it's not even me and so yeah so I think that the beginning of knowing yourself is the beginning of wisdom is true and the beginning of knowing your false self is also the beginning of wisdom because you stop leaning into your material self and presenting yourself at and I tell you
 there's something beautiful with a person's devotee of Krishna or not if people could just be like authentic and not pretty sometimes many people spiritual people especially in the oak that are so pretentious and especially in the butt
 you can't even just be a piece around them but there's people that are just
authentic with it with who they are and their shortcomings and it's an attractive thing authenticity is very attractive is what we work on in it in our spiritual life how can I get up then it got going to be sincere how can I be genuine you know how can I be vulnerable these are important things we don't want to hear about your connection to light and you know you don't get it gets old quick and an
 it's it it's like a performance for everybody you know I appreciate all that that's that's all that stuff is that's where it gets real
 I was thinking of Aristotle statement a little broader
 tell me the beginning of all knowledge
self in other words are so many questions about life there these deep existential questions you know
 and and we can we can try to figure them out you know it's like what am I doing here in this world what is the meaning of life you know within our bacta philosophy these questions get very deep like there is this is kind of more conventional they don't take teachings but as you get deeper into the into bhakti philosophy and its esoteric side
 if you can ask all these amazing questions you know like
 maybe my my nature has such it on under like Eternal full of knowledge and Bliss right but but what do we do we turn to lie. Like if I am Eternal like what how am I engaged eternally tangibly mean yeah you or oblivious you know like upon release from the bond
picture of Illusion what do I do with Charlie what is the nature of that the list can it can we describe that beliefs and greater Clarity in a with greater Clarity so that I can really understand what is the full blossoming of my spiritual potential or do you like if this world is reflection like confidential they not the same right like if it's like I'm sorry like conventional they don't just say you know this is an illusion of this is a reflection will then what's the source of the reflection you know what's that all about you know or if this world is kind of like a virtual reality how did I get stuck in it and what's the meaning of my existence within this world and why am I passing through these different bodies and experiencing joy and suffering you know up and down and what am I meant to learn from it and what is its purpose or like that's all that is such an important wisdom what does speak of like the full you know like like that question I mention early like the what do I do with terminal E
what is the nature of my Bliss how does that manifest and beautiful esoteric ways but the but the but to start
 you know those are all incredibly important wonderful questions that we should be exploring but the start of it is to know the self so this isn't like when we study about to flossing my study bug of agita when we study human bog with time
 it's not like a
 I guess I could say a religious approach but let's say let's qualify that a bit more like it's not like a simplistic religious approached I say okay here it is everybody just believe exactly just believe this and you're saved and don't believe it is and if you don't believe it you're really going to suffer like eternally that's a very simplistic approach it's a simplistic approach it's almost like they are mailing a person
Ematic kind of approach where is this says okay let's try to understand reality let's begin by looking at yourself right look at yourself first like the thing that you are most fully engaged with your own mind your own body let's try to understand you know that's that's that's that first question Who Am I who am I let's let's start right there and let's examine it by looking at a my my body and my mind
 or am I
 the person who's experiencing the body in mind and if that's the facts then what's the next step in my you know in my pursuing knowledge and so it all starts is Aristotle's saying it kind of knowing yourself
 is it beginning of always and that's where you have to start it it's it's a really it's kind of respecting
the person that you're talking to right but say okay we'll examine for yourself you know are you this body aren't you haven't you existed and other bodies even in this life what do you mean well like you were in a child's body one point right yeah well that's this body bullets not really you know because all the ingredients that make that out there not here anymore so you are in a different body back then than you are right now but but your awareness has been through both of those body so it's appears that you there where you know Observer has has been through more than one body so you're not dependent on the bar you not that body okay interesting but let's look at the mind is in the mind similar is in the mind that the thoughts that are programmed within the mind you know you you you go through many different mindsets
 throughout life you know they change is it so hard to believe that when you pass on from this body
that there's going to be a reprogramming you know that there's going to be a whole new set up maybe take some of that information but isn't there like updating and erasing and and so on from from the computer to mine this entire approach to God Consciousness is so refreshing its refresh its first instead of just just believe just believe it
 and then when you just believe and be good yes it's so it is yeah it's really respecting you know that the Inquirer and it's the phone Dennis a solid foundation to begin to go and pursue these really beautiful esoteric question and so that's what's happening what we're reading about time right now is as great as prolonged speaking to these kids that that's where he started you'd only starting right there let's try to understand who we are first
self will be the beginning of all wisdom and then we can go deeper deeper deeper and more beautiful than more esoteric get more answer more special far out questions that we thought were impossible to understand just because we didn't have a strong Foundation to begin with you know like it like if if if I if I don't first person to like I'm out my body
 well then how am I ever going to pursue those those do you know I'm a
 I may just get frustrated that these things could never be known you know these unfathomable kind of questions that they they sweet we made feel intimidated by them to intimidate even approach them and just settle into conviction that there's no way to understand all this stuff and no one ever has and nobody ever will you know like you hear those kind of statement or how the hell do you know that how do you know that nobody has discovered the answers to these
yeah it's like saying you can't figure out this computer no one no one can figure out this thing out and they can tell you how it all works how do you get a picture on the screen I can talk to you I can send you a message you can send it back how can I supposed to figure that out and there's people that do it
 I don't know how to do it yeah I do love this and it's almost but it is sort of like shit we get such an in all these teachings are such an incredible user's manual life and existence and understanding Spirit just just saying you are spirit and not a body that's just simple statement that everything is just open up everything starts to open up like oh wait a second that means I'm not a white American male that changes everything in culture today if you see a lot of white American male and not only that
I don't want anybody in this world I don't own anybody I don't I can't possess anything I'm not of this nation yeah by the way your nature is that your Eternal and your personal your phone always go for the Bliss you know that that that is such a refreshing weight approach to try and understand truth you know I mentioned this in my book pumped milk if you didn't get it get it if you did get it double it I said double it all the time now it with anything hey when you're at the store will you need a bag with this double it all right all right
 big ice cream cone I wrote this in my
but I was like one of these big spiritual epiphanies I had when I was a young man young man young man was
 that statement like are you doing this for you where you getting your happiness from are you doing it for your own personal are you getting your happiness what did you write in that where you getting your happiness is the happiness from the soul or happiness from the ego and I started to reflect on it every way I get happiness and I realize a lot of the ways that were so called Happiness was like really just to impress other people and where am I going to be a lot of it was from that and I was like man what and when I heard that statement are you trying to be God or serve God that was another one trying to be God I serve God I was like a lot of my Endeavors I'm trying to be the cool guy the center admired
adoration and distinction of Distinction adoration was it was prophet distinction and adoration adoration distinction is it called sex we want profit we want to do we want to be distinct matter fact I heard that one too I heard that in a shoe my baggage from class when I was really knew I just realize what I heard that when I heard that I was like my whole idea when I was a teenager about I'm a non-conformist I was like no I'm not going to settle sex I want to be distinct from other people to people that you're cool you're you're not like us your cool house like I just want to be noticed and get validated in the material realm it's got nothing to do with me being deep I am a deep unique person but it's got nothing to do with the way I'm cutting my hair or have you growing a beard or YouTube dying my hair or wearing uniqlo's to dye your hair back then
now I got my hair be very awkward just be hair on the side or likes the bleached it by their beards yeah that's why I listen to that it's orange it's bright I forgot I had a color that could be their color do you like Diet an orange color know what gray looks great Hill Drive people is it looks good if you're thinking well I got to stop dying you do just as beautiful yeah it is only only trying to be something you're not as Grande Problem
 knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom
 that's what all starts right now there's a plan that is a great a launching pad for our verse okay you know what we're going to be reading now recognize these versus every verse and every commentary it's like it's just chock-full of good stuff
that's good you resisted say chock full of nuts they're well. Are you kidding sing in the entire chocolate nut song I will say
 all right hit it not chocolate nuts and chocolate love that just weird that that's the only coffee people drank back then Mike Sanka and chock full o'nuts there wasn't Maxwell House is all kind of things
 four types of coffee and there weren't people don't know this but there were no coffee shops fancy coffee places in that Greek cups in a paper cup a paper cup interesting things have changed
 they sure have wronged us why do we change is in the coffee World Starbucks interesting
let's meet at the coffee shop for the word cafes and things like that right now as soon and Europeans had a whole thing going yet I'm going to rain in the musketeer West Wichita First Bank locations to the Supreme Lord and Ryan entrenar Andre to the super most human being into other saraswoti the goddess of learning
 the show the office today that the author non-stop reggae show about race Unity amaka by 2baba Tom and my rendering Services pure devotees all that is troublesome to the heartbeat of eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord of his praise with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fat on magana tomorrow unless y'all Gannon
Play Sherlock electric shooter that's why I should go to bed I was born the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes to the torch light of knowledge I offer my obeisance he's at their Lotus feet reading from a Schumer box for Tom Canto 7 chapter 7 text
 24 x 24 I think we had just heard this analogy over here and how we're not the body yet heard that allows, I'm sober and expert okay let's 324 again let's me the commentary cuz it's really worth getting into okay sober and expert persons
 should search for the spirit soul with mines. I threw analytical study in terms of the souls connection with and distinction from all things that undergo creation maintenance and destruction is pretty cool statement isn't it
read that again so we're not going to say it you hear that it may sound like all this to worry about none of it's actually quite simple make it slow and listen to it should search for the spirit soul with mine purified through analytical study in terms of 1 Souls connection with and distinction from all things that undergo creation maintenance destruction run-on sentence but yea use you actually said that you didn't read it precisely in the end even in in in in that deviation could have made it a little bit hard because you said in terms of once I think it said one soul of interest in terms of the souls connect us Souls connection right because it's not that I have a soul like I have a body and I have a mind but
I am the sole right to sober an extra person there's a good name for a band right that were sober an expert person that is more like a punk does sedation a post but they should search for the spirits all they should search for that spark of life for that identity who am I with mines purified
 that's a very interesting idea right now my mind is corrupted my mind is kind of polluted it it's not working efficiently because it's not in its pure State how do I purify to analytical study oh I have to start to analyze things you got to look at things line them up and compare them okay let's do that in to in terms of what in terms of the souls connection with and distinction from
 okay so my soul is connected to something but it's also just a something what's the what's the
 Criterion
 here that's
well it's at the soul if it is eternal whereas its separator distinct from everything that undergoes creation maintenance and destruction that concept that there's certain things that go through that those Cycles
 and we threw through analysis we can separate ourselves see ourselves as distinct from everything that goes to Creation maintenance destruction that's that's the initial process of understanding the self if it work if we do you know if Aristotle says knowing yourself begins is the beginning of all wisdom the beginning of knowing myself is this analytical study of how I am distinct from all that goes through the changes means
 I am not not only doesn't mean I'm not my body cuz my body is goes through creation maintenance and destruction it also means I'm not
mind it also means all the things that I identify with my family that goes to Creation maintenance and destruction my nation that goes to creation mean it's a distraction you know it is all did the extended identities we we we we distinguish ourselves from them and that's the Criterion some things are imposed by time and they go to the cycle create creation Mason destruction and I'm not I'm different from you
 how to report a sober person I love that word belittle Sober Sober up sober up getting all crazy talk about your coyotes sober up cuz scuba that was a sober conversation so beautiful creature out of
 I adopted it I went out all night look
for it is it hungry
 oh man hit it a sober person can study himself and distinguish the soul from the body by analytical study someone speaking to you like this right isn't it isn't it like we're talking about earlier so you saying like Okay use your own head figure it out I think about it
 his head his hands and so on one can certainly understand the difference between the spirit soul and the body no one says I had I think I read that for example part for example when one considers his body example when one considers his body is had his hands and so on one can certainly understand the difference between the spirit soul and the body no one says I had everyone says my head but there are two entities the head and I
 some people are like oh my God
you're the first time you've heard that it's like yeah of course they are not identical although they appear to be one conglomeration it's my body whose body mine who's me yeah who has the body of one that's experience in the body when we argue we find head and legs a belly blood bones urine stool and so on but after everything is considered where is the existence of the school you just set up all these ingredients and then you have you
 that's why we are where everything where conglomerates it when we break it down all these ingredients and we still haven't found a soul in there yeah the silver man however avails himself of this beta construction okay this is tutorial Punisher.
jobby Russian Tea. We got a spot. Okay and no he didn't give it to me that's okay then get a chance, didn't give it but I I want to know I found it right now so this is not the real passion I can guess okay let's hear what you think would be the spiritual is all-pervading it can't be broken down you have to have knowledge to understand it it's part of Vermont it can't be slain not exactly
 so the sage bhrigu approaches its father remind me not to translate any language that wasn't the part that was translator right there this is a little eye contacts that's are you punishing
third chapter it is is a conversation between the sage bhrigu and his father varuna and he opens it up with this question please teach me about Grumman please teach me about Spirit when you say please teach me about Brahman is saying please teach me about the spiritual energy and it's also like saying please teach me about myself cuz I made a spear and it's also the same please teach me about a Brahman kind of encompasses all that you tell me about Brahman
 I will understand it so then this is what was translate their food
 Prana the eyes the years the mind and speech this is a breakdown of the material ingredients right there's the food that we eat and all this made out of theirs that life are this is the equipment that were given to move through this world we're given eyes and senses eyes two years we got the mind we get this faculty for you know of cognition
like a computer to work with we get the power speech just like a speaker at one of those we got all this equipment all of that food Prana the eyes ears the mine speech that by which these are born
 and by which they continue to exist
 and that into which one departing they all enter that is Brahman
 so it's saying there's something that maintains there's something that stays the same and that is the cause of the development of the body and then the body is Born the body Grows All the body dies and it's all of those ingredients are withdrawing again
 that that is Brahmin so now we're keeping that in mind let's read with how proper explains that without directly translate and how he explains that in the commenter
 the secret understand that the head hands
flags and indeed the entire body have grown on the basis of the Soul okay see that's the idea here right it's not that like they are just growing that they put together then Consciousness develops because of the arrangement of the material ingredients right it's the opposite that they all come from Consciousness and they facilitate a state of consciousness and you know a particular body takes shape to facilitate someone state of consciousness
 it did it detected if the soul is within the body had hands and legs grow but otherwise they do not go either think of it the other way I could think of it this way but hear us out and try to apply this way to your thoughts a dead child does not grow up it's good example right there is that all the pieces why isn't growing any well just because the organs
stop working why do they stop working starting up again you just look at those things like this electric is Gaston shot them those are pretty a dead child would have because the defibrillator I have no idea. Child does not grow up for the soul is not present
 if I careful analysis of the body once still cannot find the existence of the Soul this is due to his ignorance Grossman fully engage materialistic activities understand the soul which is a small particle of spirit one here this math 1000 the size of the tip of a hair that's the size of it it it it it it it spreads and it would say it's an energy that spreads and animates the body
not yet so we're in a spreads it's such a person foolishly thinks that the material body has grown from a combination of chemicals other we cannot find that okay that's that's this is proper you see he would harp on this kind of stuff right he wasn't you know he gave us if we go deep into his books
 we're going to find the esoteric teachings of bhakti will find them in the Bog with time
 we'll find them in
 it isn't a tiny chart on Rita Road a Christmas love
 when David read the book theme for David in the the love of the residence for David for Krishna the love of the co-op's these kind of things going prop hats like when he's out in the world and he's trying to help people understand how to solve all the problems that we have in life he's coming right here on this
right at the beginning of all knowledge is starting with knowing oneself and he's he's very aggressively kind of countering the the popular scientific ideas are models that were being taught in universities you know and so with this statement such a person foolishly thinks he's got all his confidence that's based on this Foundation
 all of these ancient texts which he's studied
 contemplated use them to analyze the world that he's lived in and had his own direct spiritual experience with Andrew and with that confidence he's he's ready to say you know what that's a block I see through the block you know you were telling me that that Consciousness is a rising just by a combination of materials chemicals
 well then my question you would be then create life in your
so he says such a person. He thinks that the material body has grown from a combination of chemicals although he cannot find them he said I know I've experimented with this and I'll just come from the betas
 are you still at he would challenge right produce it produces an hour now or have a century down the road we will it but they have it just give us time just give us time we will that's what they say probably a post-dated check don't accept that he said was I don't accept a post-dated check except the post dated check we will in the future what it is at this point we got a pretty crazy idea at least say that cows had souls in a plum trees alligators they all came from stickle energetic force that you can't quantify you can't see you can't perceive you can't scientifically verified that you can't smell
that's a crazy idea this this energetic Force created everything there's only one crazy or very than that is that okay I'm nothing I'm just read it actually came from nothing that's crazy you know what nothing is nothing is nothing that's nothing that's that that's a creation myth if I've ever heard one here right right I can't believe people don't get down nothing
 if you know a bluff is powerful when it's
 when is couch within a lot of stuff that's not a bluff
 right in other words I can I can pass a block over when I've already convinced you of so many ways of what that what I'm speaking is true and you can practically receive that
 so the thing is the empiricist I don't want to say this scientist it's it's like
is all kind of scientist out there is a scientist who don't agree with the theory is that they put forth and teaching school there's a lot now more than ever and yes leasing ground and Times of quantum physics and there's multi-dimensions there's things we can proceed it's like a whole new era of science but even going to earlier eras when you take take like an Einstein and you know what I'll be honest it's not like I've studied his work and his writings all that much but enough from what I picked up, but I picked up what did you pick up remind Stanga still is that he kind of get on that eagle level like he didn't have you no one Christmas I was studying one phrase this morning we're going to
 the phrases found twice in the bug of agita Mahna Mahna by the Muppets
that is twice but it's not that Vita Vita Raga puriya crota being free from attachment fear and anger in the second chapter words describing the steps of your Mooney right that's one context like you know I'm let go of my attachments have let go of my fear let go of my anger and other living beings it's giving me this even mind that I passed you the world but then there's spoken of in a deeper context in text for 10 where it comes follows in the wake of the verse where two scribes if you understand Christmas birth in his activities John McCormack and they'd give you that they're transcendental
 that you don't take birth again in this world
 and then what is that at what is the attack
but that prevents us from understanding krishna's his his his Lila is activities what what kind of attachment what kind of fear what kind of anger prevents us from understanding Krishna understand even let's let's remove that one step what type of attachment what type of fear what type of anger or resentment
 blocks are prevents or even if I'm super intelligent and studied science and got a PhD and all the what kind of attachment for your anger prevents me from perceiving the personal Source behind all existence and when I look at Einstein what at what I pick up is he he was here he wasn't so burdened by attachment fear and anger that he could say I understand to my studies I've begun to understand a lot about how this world works but when it comes to understanding where it all comes from
that I don't know
 you know that I can all I can make a few inferences but I don't know if you understand that we'd have to have a whole another field of study
 you know and that's improper is always saying they're not there is no field of study for that in the universities where you know that we have Harvard and MIT but where are they studying that you would say just like this the difference between a living body in the dead body and that's what he's getting into in this commentary right let's just break it down to this fundamental question you cannot identify where the life comes from in the body and the proof of that is that you can create life in your laboratory
 so then what is it that distinct well we don't know we can't find it in our laboratory okay then we need to start to approach other sources of knowledge right you're you're saying that if it doesn't exist within the realm of my
direct perception direct perception extended through our to our instruments of science then then we rejected
 where is someone without attachment fear and anger someone without issues
 can say well what other sources are out there
 well here's a ear to hear some ancient books of testimony of people that that that that said that they experienced and understood what was beyond all this and this and end in their theories are still holding up after Millennia you can't prove them wrong why not give them a chance why not engage with them think about them that maybe just maybe these guys were right all along that the life that that that Consciousness that awareness is made of a completely different energy that you can't perceive through the material senses and
that's what gives life to the buy so therefore even if you have all the ingredients of body you don't necessarily have life
 my pain and you won't be in it no matter how how powerful your microscope is when you look into it you won't find it but if you if put it if you engage with this idea
 will it begins to open up this is the door to all kinds of knowledge about life the real deepest questions about life begin
 by understanding this distinction I'm not this body I am something completely different I made out of something completely different I have a completely different nature that doesn't go through creation maintenance and destruction that's who I am it's it's it's it's it again let me know just like where we started it's such a refreshing way to approach the deepest questions in life not with a big threat based on blind face but with an invitation to begin to examine
who am I I'm John Bossier
