 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages of daily yoga podcast with your host and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York this stupid ass welcome to Christmas Eve day before Christmas
 and I think you'll find that people get together people come together with her family sometimes you wouldn't have the best family so they're going through their stuff it says sometimes
extra special
 time to really take shelter to really get internal and sometimes it's good just to have fun with your family you're new to the show Welcome this is q and a day is what people right in their questions we try our best to answer it sometimes you don't answer their questions good sometimes you just try your best and sometimes it hits the nail right on the head and they're like that's exactly what I needed today so hopefully it's one of those Christina how are you cuz she was live in my poor holy city of Maya pour he's been there for a few months I had a great you do for us to judge and he was yesterday okay and
 great weekly Torah and myself in a couple others to the whole reading we did the whole Geeta you do the whole Geeta Mam and I tell you it was beautiful it was like a beautiful bath you know 3 + 3 and a half hour just
relishing the Gita finish up in your life that was great let's do it again you know you know what we are hosting a going away party for my son my nine-year-old so it was a house full of no 8 7 8 and 9 year olds and it was a little crazy but we should we try to read as much as possible we did five chapters and I will say that as I'm reading and I was like I got to read the Bhagavad Gita I got to do that if you don't take a bath if you're camping or something I got to take a bath and then you realize juxtaposition against not taking a bath how important bathing is in the same as you're going to get here like I kind of do this more this is so good for me
 Professor Snape he said they did the whole thing with skinergy was amazing nice
is it it is so nice
 yeah if you finish your like I could do this every day you know that's how you that's how I felt okay I meant to Krishna I should be doing this every day and I start to realize life is short it's like how many times am I going to read the Bhagavad Gita in this lifetime I got very inspired by doing that and I I love the fact that within the spirit culture there's always these things like okay it's either jayanti this is the day to read the okay it's ROMs appearance is identification Lord Bron okay it's called to see if there's a day to you know this isn't focused on devotion it's great how it's peppered throughout the throughout the month the week the years
 everyone that is a holiday event it in the Philadelphia Temple
 that's moving like the vets
it's moving south I'm noticing she's going south to North So Much Anymore she's moving more south than I thought we were going to get the South to come up here but the Everett know there's like sort of a retreat Philly steal her away from us
 anyway was great day was great being detailed and then I'm ready for today and I'm okay if I'm ready for today
 you know what I may be what chapters did you read where I'm at
 1 2 3 4 5 you didn't order you know I was really thinking that you know that we're going to be able to finish it all and it just like we just got overwhelmed with kids stuff then we got to this point like the whole body works like really this the party's going this long and I Outsource it to my 18 year old daughter to watch all the kids
read another chapter but you know of the Mahabharata reading that we've been doing from the new HD goswami when it's not quite out yet but that you and I have
 again that perspective it was it was even kind of opening up the gate 2 for me anyways you know what I do whenever I read the first chapter of the Gita it was always very clunky until I read them a Bart and then it's like oh yeah yeah yeah then the first chapter soda pops and comes alive see it was popping for me yesterday was the 11th chapter you know where are doing it turns to Krishna after seeing the universe for me like I don't know what your mission is that's what he says I don't know what your mission is
 and then when you're looking at in front of that Mahabharata perspective of like you know that the asaurus had very intentionally had a strategy how to take over the Earth and at at the appeal of Mother Earth was coming to 2
read her the asuras and Arjuna sitting here hesitant to step into the battle where that's meant to take place and end in Arjuna turn secretions is I don't know what your mission is criticize you you are Junior you're meant to be an instrument in this fight you know it was inspired where you many ways are the Nets and it's nice to Sochi with the voice always is great way to build relationships with the devotees to know that share this together
 we're also gearing up to go to India we're leaving for India last minute last call try to have a last call here to Alaska airport I can last call
 we're leaving on the 30th and the kids go here and they are and
 anyway I'm happy to have all my
it's here together but we're to talk about that in the first in the first question it's not okay
 this is from an anonymous threat
 with everything that we're reading in the Bible Tom recently I'm confused about how to have a healthy relationship with our children we say not to be attached to them say that and although I understand the content not to be attached to them and although I understand the concept I don't understand what that looks like practically as if it doesn't feel healthy to be detached either I've young children which is not something I particularly wanted and it's taking time for me to see this Christmas Grace a gift to help me on my spiritual path
 for a long time
felt more like it was dragging me into a Life of Illusion because of all material things that come up with having children all the time spent dedicated to taking care of them instead of chanting or doing sauna at cetera and so I'm confused as to how to cultivate a healthy relationship with my children I feel that if I am healthy and joyful watching them grow up I called the attachment but then if I don't care or I'm not particularly happy about it that I'm not doing my role as a mother properly so what does it mean to have children but to be detached the bond is very emotional how can I not feel happiness or distress when things happen to them thank you for your light and wisdom Harry Krishna
 good question very good question. I just it's a it's a very very tricky question actually then it was like I feel like I'm not over it yet but
my three littlest kids are 18 about to be 17 and 9
 and I had two older kids that I raised her stepchildren that were erased from the when they were five and six and so it is a it is a
 slackline black line is I was I usually walk on that I'd like to love and to be detached to love and understand you can't possess or own this person which is riddled with your expectations of this person's and your idea that you can actually protect this person we actually have no protect we have we have minute we have some protection but it's everything is minimized and and so I don't think it's
 is part of
Dharma
 these kids were given to you for a reason and that Emma and Emma love and the protection that you can give them
 will help develop your character and we need our character to advance in our spiritual life where into developing character that's part of our growth and I realize how to keep my kids were sent to me to work on my character to develop a sense of selflessness to develop a sense of love that's not tinged with some reciprocal of bartering sense of self was love but ultimately to understand and to feed me this truth that I have to love without possessing and then I have to love without the hope for like this you know this incredible ciprocal love cuz that is that is reserved for Krishna you might get some love back you might get a little love back you know but you might get nothing back yet it starts it's our duty to still love and have a
open heart and to live in a world without resentment and bitterness and so our children come to us to to develop like this type of selflessness and concern because I can say my in my younger days you know love was love was tied into sexual attraction High School thing I love her do you love her that we use this word while we throw it around so cheaply it's almost like how a lie and loves of lamb in a lion is a level and they want to consume the person so if you tease this out to the highest thing it becomes like a selfless giving and probably say the love of God the closest thing you have is a mother's love for the child and not expecting anything in return and so like what's the little baby going to give back to the mother except some you know mother can take care nurture spend time wake up at all hours of the night and the baby vomits you know that's what the
he's going to get back
 so there's a Selfless Love and in a Marine training in one sense so the children children are gift for our spiritual life and sometimes pain just like any any type of operation to remove suppose I got shot at the remove a bullet or it was supposed to have a bad tooth them's got to be extracted there's a little pain if not a lot of pain that goes through in the healing process in the surgery or the removal of the the rotted roots of the tooth and in that pain comes that growth and that's what we're that's what we're hoping for and if I get caught up in you know it's easier to get resentment it's easy to lead with expectations it's easy to end up bitter like I've done so much for these kids I mean my father I find myself saying the same thing that my father used to say he's robbing appreciative kids
sometimes I just blurt that ungrateful kids do so much for them but it is a they are a gift and I I have to I have to always Resort back to that this is why I'm here that they're here for my growth not to possess not 20 not to control not to and an ultimately like for all my kids are here right now for the holiday and it up two years ago none of them were here it's like because I went to this you know painful divorce both both parties are painful and dumb all the kids weren't here and I was like I was devastated and so to the degree that I understand like I can't possess this that was a lesson of like I don't possess them you can lose them in any at any moment due to a divorce or a family issue or a sickness or something like that
 and I had to deal with that and I had an internalized that and I had to lean
my spiritual teachings and that's what we are all asked to do in cases like this we leaned into our spiritual teachings and understand like this is about you and God here okay and
 anyway I think I'm just sort of dribbling off into space but they're all getting presents this year
 that was all real whatever was that was very real very real now here's what I got to say I am sure that in some previous life
 I was a mother and I had a child in my womb that I carried for months and then gave birth to that child but I don't have any in this lifetime I don't have any memory
and it's some I can only try to imagine
 wow that affect you emotionally oh my God
 you don't know that Rugrats you don't know that you don't even know I know I know I know I don't know but you don't know what it's like to have a baby and Cary for that I don't know that I'm saying okay it's kind of like you're embracing the baby for nine months before you even give it birth like 24 hours a day you know and then you give birth to it and it's feeding off your body and you're constantly with it and if you feel such a strong emotional connection than the great turn the kitchen's turns on you that's not my point but my point is that that is part of Nature's
 Way
I'm doing different things right but yeah but think there's there's two where it was such a sincere question and then when I heard it is kind of like there's two things going on here and you know we had an episode
 it was episode 1030 6 and it was called you can't see 3D art wearing an eyepatch remember that right now I'm going to that take away you can't it's not even to take what I was the title of it you can't see through are wearing an eyepatch meaning because it requires what she wants for the stereo optic depth perception option is that we required yes we talked about this right now. I forgot it off at thinks who are you
my AOL account to haul these people
 what is this microphone you know that's Tara and let that that you can only see you need do you need a optic vision if you cover up on our you'll never see the image appear okay it take stereo optic death depth perception and so in that in that episode we discuss that seeing this world seen this material world that we're moving through requires a type of stereo optic depth perception in that episode weirdest weirdest grabbing that those two lies one eye of spiritual optimism and one I have material pessimism right you don't really see this world clearly unless you're seeing both of those they sound like they're the opposite
 they're not but you just have to see with both those eyes that I love it I love it
that's the Central Station
 that that's yeah that's exactly that's that's the bhakti they don't division
 right Ed and kind of like the way that I look at in way to vedanta
 is this kind of monocular vision it kind of focus is on the especially I mean maybe that's not entirely fair but they don't to really does it in a big way and let's get into this here I'm going to say that when you look at your role as a mother you look at your existence as a mother right because you right now
 in this time. In this moment in time in this blip in time you are a mother and you have not you are not my mother I thought it was a mother who are Anonymous questioner is a mother is a mother in this blip in time
when you need it is your duty and responsibility to embrace that role
 bully and live it and your child should never doubt for a moment your love your child should never doubt for a moment your care you know your child should feel the full power of your motherly love in order to the day that they're the race psychologically healthy and then someone that's that's your duty
 same time and that's the one I write I am a mother this is my child my child is dependent on me to mail a g it is good one right the two eyes good stereo out there so that's so that's one I that you seen was right that's one I threw what you're seeing this world I'm a mother this is my child this child is dependent on me and dependent on my love but with the other eye the other eye is Saint
 yeah I carry this child in my
my womb for nine months but I had what did I have to do with it it all happen without my my own power this body isn't even me right that it's just something that I'm passing through for a moment and in by some magic write some beautiful magic this child took birth within me it in my in my body provided all the ingredients it needed for its body
 and and and I was given the Dharma I was given the responsibility to care for this being
 that is like me a billion years old right like me eternal right not not it in one sense appearing helpless and appearing they need my help
 in another sense
 for all I know I was their child in a previous birth what were two were two were two Souls moving through this through this world which is in our Paradise
 it's hard
diversity is our place to learn
 and I got a paradise State University it's our University so settled I said I said both of these things in in that episode 10 that I wasn't listening a presentation at the writing on the board that is one of these in our Paradise it's our University when you begin to see it that way if you as a mother if you see with only one I say this is My Paradise this is this from this little being I get love I feel love it if it makes this world a beautiful place there's true there's a there's a temporary truth in that but also you have to send this is our universe what am I meant to learn and understand through this to the plane is role as a mother and in part of it is is this child one day is going to walk away or I walk right out of the house and I will be like but but you need me and the child need to be free of you
you know the child on the couch and yes I think the whole world is like this not even just with children anonymous anonymous writer with the the pain of the world you have to notice the pain of the world and you have to let that in somehow inspire you and let you otherwise you just get so depressed with the pain of the world the ever never-ending Wars and Trauma and kidnapping and tragedies and students it's enough to get you so depressed
 unless you have the other eye open to see that Eternal Vision as well otherwise we're just
 it's other we just become these existentialists
angry people did her angry at the world
 Soleus A1 School of Atlanta saying this is not your child
 don't fall into that illusion even walk away from it all you don't renounce it all it's keeping you Bound in this world you've had children and all of your different incarnations and and each time you thought this is my child this child is dependent on me Etc all my love flowing to this child is a complete illusion it's if that's all just a game going on in the mind that's caused by the cuteness which is just a temporary manifestation of of you know molecules coming together in a certain cute little shape and now you become the Wilderness again and it and all of that now about to leave it on his little different right here renunciation is in the highest principle love is the highest principle
 the woodbox even unto wants to do is it wants to get your love heading in the right direction
so where were we when we don't have any way. They were thinking all my love close to this child all my heart close to this child and what body we don't is saying is
 when you think that way you're thinking an illusion and you will feel pain because of it get ready for that what but since this universe is our University what are we meant what are degrees what do we walk away with understanding we walk away understanding that ultimately my myself my ability to love my child
 all of this comes from one root
 and that road is God that really should beautiful sweet baby Krishna right beautiful Krishna it's all stemming from Krishna and soap box even unto saying don't stop loving
 but love your child in the context of your love for God
don't don't see your child outside of that context mother your child with love
 but with the love that's informed with the with with the understanding that we are both the children of Sri Krishna right we are and when your love for Sri Krishna becomes deeper and deeper you'll have you'll you'll have bhakti and you'll have Gianna right you'll you'll have a heart full of of appreciation a Heart full of sweetness a Heart full of love and you'll also have Clarity of I understand that I'm not this body I understand that this child is not my property I understand the time will come
 and separate us right at the end end and end with this you'll see a truth so deep
 that your love will that this super magic thing happens is that you can actually through loving
route not ignoring that route which is when we think this one would just blind think this baby is mine you know and that's the absolute truth but you'll see this deeper truth you'll feel this deeper and you'll feel this deeper love love to the route and through love you won't get your love will not be limited to this one child anymore or to this two or three or what however many children you have and you feel too busy you'll feel love for every living being and so that's for but his head is so so you know let's not become confused there's a I think what are are
 a question or saying is I'm hearing on one hand we need to be detached right but then how am I going to be a good mother know be a good mother even be attached
 but attached in the context
 of the relationship the both of you have with Krishna
 I'm attached to you because Chris is giving me to you to care on his behalf right because you belong
him this is you know what we were going to bug of agita yesterday and as we're going through at all you don't just so many worse is coming up again you know you just have to hear them because it's this reading a chapter a day it is really where it's at because you just keep refreshing you said you know you read the Bhagavad Gita 20 times in in like a in a year that way and it's so you don't spend years without like touching on these verses and you know it reminds me of that there's this beautiful verse your famous first the feeling very very famous first is 434a choir from them submissively render service unto them that self realize Soul can impart knowledge unto you
 because they have seen the truth this is our University right we're going to learn something here it's not a pear
University so then what are you what do you like what do we learn from the spiritual master and that comes in the next person this person is not nearly as often quoted but for me this is the verse that really likes me a lot you know
 text 4:35 having obtained real Knowledge from a self realize soul
 you will never fall in again into such illusion for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but a part of the supreme or another words that they are mine and so this is what you're meant to learn from the University of this world from the University of motherhood write the University of motherhood one informed by the bug of agita 14 bus from the Bible Thomas yes I love this child I love this child with all my heart and I do all that I can to protect and care for the child and provide for the child on behalf of Krishna as my Dharma
all along realizing that just as I am a part of Krishna and I am Christmas this child is part of Krishna and his krishnas
 and now that love is in this place that love that you have for your child isn't distracting you from your body from your love for Krishna it's all part of your love for Krishna
 and insult so don't feel torn between the two don't feel like I can't am I not supposed to love my tell am I supposed to be detached in one sense right you detach cuz you got this one I of of truth that's recognizing that I'm not the provider ultimately I'm a secondary provider I'm not the mother ultimately I'm the secondary mother temporarily playing this role but we're all the both of us
 are eternally connected to Shri Krishna he's the mother he's the father he's the provider he's everything for us
 what you got there I'm going to pull in some now
I'm going to read a chapter right now you just content
 are you breaking out of her sweet stuff
 this is from Bossman
 it's not from Boston from Marsha Gore Ohio show course is partial from the UK the friend of ours
 recently I've been really getting into the gunas that doesn't sound good right about the green about this. I have a few questions around these topics
 where do the modes are The Goonies come from
 did Krishna mention the modes for the first time in the bag of agita or were they mentioned in The Vedas or the srimad bhagavatam
are there different stages in life linked to the goodness to the moments child childhood young adult elderly Etc. His dying in the mud of goodness is preferred how can we prepare for this
 finally number for how can we interact with people who are visibly in the mode of passion ignorance without criticizing condemning or thinking we're better than them caveat I'm always fluctuating between the mode so I'm far from perfect
 we are better than many would you want a time where they come from the Christian mentioned that were the where they mentioned the guitar for the first time they go back there in The Vedas I have a quote
Graco it's a part of the whole day that understanding of reality yeah there's a verse from their tarva beta 10843 says there's a 9 gated Lotus which I think can be in the heart or often of the human body is bubbling is the nine gated
 city right there's a 9 gated Lotus
 under covered under three bands of gunas we should get into actually let's to say what the moon is Orcas a religion is going to have to help me talk and then right who are they some kind of weird people the goons what's the Moon's phase right now. I thought cuz you know when we say motive goodness more passion motivating her ends you know it is you translate these these words suffragists Thomas the best you can but there was a verse at the end of the 70
chapter and I thought this was a great way to describe them
 the motive illumination Nicea the motive attachment in the motive delusion that's a nice but they're hard to try to trying your best to translate these but they're sort of the partially untranslatable yeah sometimes you got to get to know the Sanskrit word in all their meat but I thought that was very helpful those really you know like if you say passion people like her passions good thing right and it's not. I couldn't think more attachment you know so it so it what what the what's The Vedic literature do you punish a thousand in bug of agita and someone they described that this world that were living in
 is composed of these three energies that everything material is built of a combination of these three energy
and that each one of these three energies has its influence whether be Illuminating weather be creating a stronger feeling of material attachment or whether it be a state of delusion and on an insult like every object is radiating one of these influences you know whether it's the people that we meet or the music that we listened to it everything of this material realm is buy one of these because they affect their mind they picked our thoughts affect our emotions they affect our desires Yogi has to be very aware of what they're picking up as they're moving to the world okay so the partials question was the dispersed coming down to get to know it's there and then it's there in The Vedas is there a new punish us but you know I'm not fighting either you or I rather not really familiar with we we never studied upanishads in depth
 but I think the bug of agita
Rogers 14 17 and 18 I think they're that might have been the first place where you get a really
 Thoreau you know kind of analysis of them I'm not sure about that but as far as I'm aware you know you could you get a very thorough analysis in those books so yeah there they are around there their and numb
 an earlier literature than the bug of agita okay how about this one are there different age is linked to the modes childhood young adult early well I know Teenage life is Passion I've never heard of a lot of it is a person applying the Gita to their life and then realizing it in their own life and then explaining it to their students and that's how they teaching it is also taught you know so I can say
my own wife possessed by Passion in My Teenage life possessed by it and it's riddled with all these with a Gita talks about are the symptoms of passion which is intense hope intense Endeavor that said that not only in your teenage life expands into your married life in your married life as well I'm sometimes it and according to the person according to their activities according to the occupation according to the relationships cord to the highest or Empire choices in life it will either be aggravated or be subdued and and of course adding bhagva Tom adding transmit the wisdom to your life then it will bring you and you know that next question how do you prepare for you know dying in the motive of goodness
 it's from a millionaire life but anything you want to share about a different
well you know I've never read anything about that I've read about that in terms of are you Veda and in the different
 docious you know how like but but but when I think about it I think like take an infant or a young baby there's a lot of time I go in there the baby sleeping a lot you know and crime to drool crying over this crying over you know it's it's yeah it seems like Thomas you know this is a relatively influential that point to the whole world like babies are adorable to you to Gianni's using your intelligent beings sleeping take care of itself covered themselves in feces Play-Doh in your ring send me some info into Tamil.
cuz you're saying I agree entirely young adult and I would say married life when you're when you're establishing yourself in the material world right when you're going after sex you're going after wealth and at that age. Which I would say you know goes from the teens through to you know the twenties in the thirties you know ideally as you're getting older your life can become more what's up big guy we we don't have a car we don't have a culture that that's even aware of this kind of stuff or even kind of clear about how we should be evolving in life when I was a teenager we have these neighbors across I just want to jump in here we have these neighbors across the street
 I hated them and I'm going to like what is up with these people their yard was perfect there in a walkway was perfect the driver was perfect or houses play
everything was in place sometimes their lawn was so small was like a golf course and I sometimes a leaf would fall and I saw the man sweeping his grass and I was like don't these people have anything better to do with their life and all it was is they were just very suck dick very organized and maybe a little bit. I'll get out of a people that just they just have the material lived in orders of their mental condition there may be a little out of the closet just clean good Suffolk parents the kids were grown and they were just like good the lawn clean and it drove a person like me who's totally in the mud of passion it drove me crazy. You're like why are you hoping for this and desire for this is going for this
 they were happy just keeping the nice the place that the mine felt good when everything is clean and in place
 and they felt maybe they felt a duty to provide that for the neighborhood
that's why I'm sure they did so when you said people don't even understand like they don't what what evolution looks like right now and you know when you get older sometimes people they don't sleep as well you can say they don't sleep as well but it may not be exactly they're not sleeping as well but they just need to sleep fast
 you know and that sucks fix you no like oh I wake up at 3 in the morning you know in our culture think what's wrong I'm waking up at 3 in the morning here I would like it you know in a in a yogurt culture psycho this is great I'm waking up at 3 and I want to go to sleep you know Ed at 8 a.m. at 8 p.m. and I want to wake up you know it at 2 or 3 p.m. is like where you're doing great. You got a real what's up big existence going on here you know you're you're wide awake in the brim of my or two during these hours that are ideal for contemplation actly exactly
I really should sleep more mentions that the Parma wakes you up, wakes you up and so sometimes when I wake up and I save
 that was a momma's but but but sometimes I wake up and I look at the clock and it's really early and I just think I don't want I want to sleep more and then I think am I just ignoring the is it that the gift of the Parma right now you know right like talk to the hand parmatma right here trying to wake me up to yes I think about that a lot when I'm thinking should I take another hours sleep and then I hear all this leave me I'm sleeping
 Huntington on the train
you think that I think that is chapter 36 of the third can't apartment wake him up scholar you he's great at it see it seems like you could in a general way say childhood, goon middle you know those middle years from teens up to the say 50 even or you know definitely up to 40 Projects Luna and then later life idealease up Amaya
 maybe maybe not elderly you know I mean it wasn't cuz you kind of turned into a child again with a coughing but but but I think like late 40s 50s 60s 70s I think we can be pretty septic because the passion
physiologically releases a little bit yeah that can either go to to Thomas or something but depending on what you're all sort of Life lifetime of cultivating should have sat there and which kind of Segways into the next question
 Ohio's wanted to interact with people were visibly in the mode of passion in their ignorance is preferred prepare for the clear unless you can pull up the versus this is 14 chapter
 let's say that's not it
 that's not it every go okay so it's describing the different moon has the different modes and it says
driving all different
 it is it's describing it it's describing how to understand them in different contexts 01 context is dying and so text 14 and 15 of the 14 chapter say when one dies in the mode of goodness they attain the pure higher planets of the great Sages
 I'm reading about those planets rather not because I'm reading free hotdog with Tom Rita
 this isn't a spiritual bypassing there's actually higher planets go to and take this isn't this isn't the end all this world and that matter fact back to that first question about the kids this cuz you're going to be grown up in a moment you're going to sneeze and then there's going to be photos of little children that's right or a twenty-year-old knows that that was a day in your life or you're raising kids islands like yeah man
my mom was a great grandmother will say things like you know enjoy them when they're young because they're sure they get off and do their own thing and then and then that hole mini chapter of their life Roadhouse back to letting it all come out
 Target.
 Enjoyable am looking at Amy's. She's like so there it says that if you died in the motive goodness can you tell the pure higher plan to the sages if you die in the mode of passion you take birth among those engaged in political activities among those working for stuff in this world and when you die in the motivator it's you take birth in the Mutual of Omaha's Animal Kingdom
ignorance you take birth in the animal kingdom that is but that probably called the greatest the greatest fear the greatest fear it can relieve you Krishna conscious can save you from the greatest fear which is that taking birth in the animal kingdom but now this is important so the question asked Christian Mission sign the mode of goodness is preferred how can we prepare this but is there it's only prefer to the lowermost but what's really prefer to talk about in the eighth chapter and it in other places too which is here famous first text 860 let it out today with all the things are exciting things that romantic things a tragic things that are happening the last thing they're worried about is oh man I might have to take birth as an animal nobody's worrying about that.
but it's a reality where that stops from is right there's every chance you could be an animal but a man has their careful everyone will the verse that you were alluding to earlier recognize is that the one about the greatest fear
 Imagine by busting into a a Krishna Das concert and sing very soon if you don't do something about it will the ideas kirtan can save you from the right in The Hobbit this is us off this page the Hologram or nachos
patio in a visit a little bit about them up yesterday I miss you try at a motto by the greatest fear right in this endeavor and hear this endeavor it speaking about you could say nishkam karma yoga especially in the context of bhakti right performing Bucky without any material desire in this endeavor there's no loss or diminution you don't lose what you accrue through this and a little Advanced been on this path and protect one from the most dangerous fear it so that's that's Christians promise right
 but people who say that I know you don't then they're Seahawks go after little birds just subscribe on on Instagram to natureismetal in
or nature is bloody heresy that 12 I have not heard of that one.
 Their listenership just bumped right there okay but let me let me let me make this point right now so Christian has not advising that we try to die in the motor goodness cuz that's still one of the three modes of material nature what he's suggesting is that we die and consciousness of him which is a state of awareness that rug another earlier called Shoot aside for writing means pure goodness pure supper but it doesn't even mean like the material motives Syfy it means the spiritual energy that our awareness is entirely spiritualized so Christian says Intex 6 of chapter 8 whatever state of being one remembers when they quit their body or set of country that state he will attend without fail and then text 7 does not serve a shoe collection Fort Worth
construction tasma therefore survey shoe College you at all times
 mom me a new smart mama no smarter remember me think of me meditate on me all the time all the time right whether you're waking up with you going to sleep whether you're at home whether at work we have to find a way to make it all yoga you make it all y'all to make it all bring in the mind to Krishna so it does not serve a shoe College who therefore all the time on usmart I think of you and you ja and at the same time for a fight right with your activities dedicated to me and your mind intelligence fixed on me you will attain me without doubt that's that's where the bug of you two that's where Christmas pass away in the motive goodness he's saying pass away in Consciousness Consciousness with me
 he says in the next verse He Who
meditates on music Supreme personality God in his mind consoling gauge remembering me on deviated from the path
 he or Arjuna is sure to reach me so that's that's our goal.
 So we just finish off this last part of this question how do we interact with people are visibly in the middle pasture and ignorance you get right in their face and you said nothing you. Don't you understand what an animal you're going to become and have become
 yeah I mean he said without criticizing condemning or thinking we're better than them
 well first of all
 I'm not in the mode of goodness enough to criticize or condemn them
 you know yeah I don't think there's
I was saying there are different there is gradations of behaviors that is okay you are better than that you're better
 Fisher better I didn't answer when we understand that we can become victims of these goodness and also that's why he knows that if it's not for krishna's grace in the grace of the Bison of us the grace of the buggy these Moe's can overtake me in it instant just boom I can become confused and illusion it in any second so we walk around very lightly very well not taking Pride for thinking hey I've conquered them know what time is there to tell us that right who is the muni again under the water
Shibari so you know he's so advanced yoga he can go under the water and met him and meditate down there for years at a time
 one little act mode of passion with Witnesses amongst the fish boom you know it overtook them you know who became serve them so that's what we're trying to do also were throwing lifelines out to people that that's what this podcast is but everybody dies in their own way then reach out to the share Transit until now and here's a link listen to this you know you get out prashad you teach you teach wisdom you have a gathering at your home and you hear the stuff in a regular basis and it resonates with something deep underneath the temasek behavior underneath the passion of behavior that's what I'm doing you know a great Point regular
