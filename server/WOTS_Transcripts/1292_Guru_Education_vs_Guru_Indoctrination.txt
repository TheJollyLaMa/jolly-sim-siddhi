 there I am the mosquito netting for resetting the Schumann bhagat on which is the very means of conquest or should offer respectful obeisances into the person out there got in there Ina Johnson are not trying to reach you this for most human being to Mother starts with t the goddess of learning and I just realized you asked Dave about the author that stuff probably about 3 shoe dog about the Savior you Tomas lo que tienes sticky a regular attendance in classes on Bago Tom and by rendering of service to the pure devotees all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service on
personality of godhead who is praise with transcendental songs is established as an irrevocable fact shalaka yeah I was born in the darkness of your knowledge I offer my respectful obeisances unto them
 they were reading from the srimad Bhagavad time we're in canto 7
 chapter 7 and I think yesterday we were I think the last four to read was with the weary 3132 know we haven't had 30 31 31 30 90 yeah you're at the right time and
 okay so I'm sorry read 29
okay and so 29 but I'm going to read it again and just so that I know how many of the different processes oh yeah okay and it course this is a demon Bobby time that it is it's just so sensual so Central to the bar with a message that there are so many different practices are processes listed in an expanded on India's Rivers works but here we have the boys in the Box I'm just going to keep shining light on the process about to yoga it's going to keep not only shine a light on it but carefully establishing how special unique and important it is and that it is the combination of all the other practices at the old Bill tours is that they all work towards this and this is where the full evolution
 of the souls potential is met that this is where one finds in the in the words of the Bible time itself
went fine. My super City to the complete satisfaction the sole so prolonged is telling his little young Friends of the different process is recommended for disentanglement from Material life so many are there
 the one person explained
 and accepted by the Supreme personality of God it should be considered all perfect that process is the performance of Duties by which what happens does one find
 material prosperity and blessings no does one find Freedom from Material suffering and and ultimate peace know I will do those things are found but it's it's not doesn't. They're the real thing the real goal the final conclusion the full manifestation is that by which Love by The Supremes or develops in the word use that was Ferretti we spoke a little about that now we're rich
30 and 31 are you ready to Tonya churn Prabhu yes and
 i o n in it in the commentary took to that verse 29 Prophet wrote this he said as soon as one is situated on the platform of bhakti yoga the root cause of one suffering and material bondage is destroyed
 this is clearly explained to the next verse which gives the secret of success so if you want to know what is the secret of success in spiritual life that will be shared in this next 2 vs 2 vs put together text 1331 here goes a little prayer last week and his friends he says one must accept
 the Bonafide spiritual Master some of this stuff could be pretty triggering understanding of how one relates to a girl one must accept.
5 spiritual master
 and render service unto them with great devotion and face whatever one has in one's possessions
 I'm so whatever one has in one's possession should be offered to the spiritual master and in the association of saintly persons and devotees one should Worship the Lord for the glory of the Lord with face glorify the transcendental qualities and activities of the Lord
 always mad at 8 on the Lord's Lotus feet
 and Worship the d-devil Lord strictly according to the injunctions of shastra the Sacred texts and Guru okay so you here are you here we're hearing about the secret success it has to do with one's connection with a master in this right you can in your you're offering everything to them you're offering your possessions you're offering your whatever you have will calmly we say
you offering your of your body and your mind and your words you're saying everything that you possess your meant to offer to this person sounds a little scared you have any initial thoughts on that sheet on each arm before we went to the commentary
 yes Mission ship and relationship based on love
 I haven't got a deep loving relationship and one person wants to give those kind of sentiments arise from a deep sense of love we appreciate them as wonderful but at the same time
he did that kind of sentiment can also be used so what is that and that is
 what needs to study equipment intelligence
 so I got a hold of Mission ship between the disciple is also based on the educating and lightning disciple the one key difference between education and indoctrination
 is that education is about
 how to think better than the formation is about what to think
 let me see that in the package it also kushner's God is the ultimate so that is the broad mood and because that educational dress
clozapine component is there in the system of directing a lot worse the Goodwin to the group message I supposed there's always you know when we read these texts
 there's so many challenges their this there's challenging any kind of teaching being handed down what does people just just even saying modern time what's a speak of if we're taking texts that are from thousands of years ago in a different language from a different culture you know how to translate their there meaning the essential meaning of them is going to be a challenge then that's why it's so much emphasis is it on the spot and para that that it's be handed down in this chain this link of not only a link of Messengers but a link of people that live in understand the message so that they can hand it down in such a way work fully translates
so that's challenging enough but I suppose it's another challenge in there that
 you mentioned you no love here that particularly in the realm of love there's no nobility you know that that's a really requires opening your heart and giving of yourself and so whenever we do that there's always the possibility it's in one sense it opens the door for some sort of exploitation unit like when parents see that their child is falling in love with someone like since they want them to to love
 another sense a little frayed is this person going to hurt them you know we always knew we could come in here as you do these things I put the father's telling the boyfriend do you know if you heard this girl in anyway I'm going to have you heard of our time big trouble
so when one opens up there's always that possibility here is talking about within the realm of the Gru and the disciple and you know unfortunately to world where we do we've seen so much exploitation particularly
 especially as it's come to the West
 and a lot of people lose faith in these in the way that these texts describe that relationship because they do speak in a language that's like saying You must give yourself to this person fully one must accept the bona fide spiritual master I have to do that and render service unto him with great devotion in faith whatever one has one's possessions when should be offered to the spiritual supposed to go to my bank account I what am I supposed to hear he says in the previous verse it has been said that
process which immediately increases one's love and affection for the Supreme personality of God in the process by which you developed that ROTC that a Divine love which is the goal about you
 that that process is the best of the many thousands of ways to become free from the entanglement of material existence okay so there's many different yoga pads
 they're all aimed at becoming free from the entanglement of material existence but here is being said that the one that has to do with this Divine love is the best of them is also said the pharmacy at Tom Thumb thumb thumb this is this is from Mahabharata is it saying that will that will read his profile it says he says that at the actually the truth of Dharma the truth of religious principle star must you
 is extremely confident
it's very hard to ascertain even if they're in the books it can be difficult to put one's finger on none the less it can be understood very easily
 if one actually adopts the principles of Dharma
 as it is said among your mom to suck shot Bhagavad Taneytown the process of religion in the process of Dharma is enunciated by the Supreme Lord because he is the supreme authority looking at this is all sounding just off the bat it's all sounding you know it definitely has a ring of a very kind of dogmatic kind of idea here okay there's there's you no one must accept
 here are the principles to given by God they're not stated directly
 it continues this is indicated in the previous verse by the word bag of a toad
the injunctions are directions of the Lord are infallible and their benefits are fully insured according to his directions which are explained in this verse the perfect form of Dharma is Buck yoga okay so first of all it's a mention that this is confidential that it's hard to understand that it is I supposed to cancel Sunday's confidential has not revealed to everyone it's it's who is reveal to
 depends on a choice or some qualification it could you speak to that all proved their idea how this is confidential
 yeah so no bad just got off the road
play the Bebe open our heart that a man says
 Krishna is Krishna is also closed for the Heart is Open the more that relationship close
 that is it's not immediate Demand on the first day one opens when hearts
open my name Dad beat it is it isn't that in law now that is pure is located where we will not be as it will not incriminate to approach so
 what can I do right now so you can expunge Russian tea cakes
 the decided the superintendent teacher both of them they mutually on each other also
the disciples in the garage here here's a principle here is a fundamental idea that one can always reach to when they're reading something and it sounds very alien or there's some beer maybe about misapplication how this could be so easily misapplied is that we will find these statements that are perhaps triggering or concerning with Cindy's text
 but if we continue to look at these texts were going to find other statements
 that will help us contextualize them or help it help fully explain the topic so Francis I say with Karma you know the idea that for every activity that we do there's a reaction to it there for my current circumstances have been determined
influenced by my previous actions okay that's an interesting idea that's their the now we're saying that and once I'm responsible for my circumstances one way to interpret that one way to to run with that is to say will let me be very careful how I treat everyone because if I treat people with any cruelty and some callous way then that's coming back at me if I cheat others I'll be cheated you no excetera but another way that one could interpret it is to saying well now what you're saying is that anybody that's in it any unfortunate position it's their own fault
 and even if they're actively being exploited by someone what we should just ignore that because they brought it upon himself and nothing needs to be done to correct this so really the fault lies not with the oppressor but with the victim now you're victim-blaming and so
it could be interpreted that way or could be let's say misapplied that way but if we look further into the same text that are speaking about Karma
 they're also speaking about the necessity to practice compassion ride like that that must always be there so long with these teachings of karma come the teachings of compassion it so that every living being should be dealt with and understood through compassion and so now if we play them both together we have a system that works but if you try to take take it without that if you try to take the teachings of karma without the teachings of compassion then it's very likely that you're going to miss pliers and dumb and and it becomes a
 a vehicle or tool for further suffering rather than for relieving suffering
 so you share that in a similar way you're you're you're you're speaking to this that yes it can be concerning that it we're going to give ever
thing to this person but this is something that you don't walk in the door and do tomorrow this is something that's gradually developing that the two are kind of getting to know each other and understand each other before there's such a full-on loving circumstances you know what you're giving yourself entirely when you marry someone you know but we generally we don't encourage people to jump into that encourage them to spend a little time to get to know each other first station that statements from the Eastex all apart of a worldview
 and then within that when they make one state
message Brent if it's not still contacts me see what's going on over here sometimes especially scripture explain three framework that was there, our Focus needs to be what is my Dharma not what they have done in the past because of the doctor sees a patient admitted to the emergency YouTube
 another doctor in the back of their mind is so bad you know this person took drugs and because of which they suffer but
 the doctors focus is not
something drugs, what can I do as a part of educating the patient so that it has that kind of incident the prices doesn't recur know any religious tradition on any screen s statements if the mood of service is taken away.
 Nothing that is okay and therefore the doctor has to take certain vows that this is how they will operate the little always operate to relieve suffer
excetera excetera that that's their you know it's interesting that you mention doctor cuz I was also thinking in terms of some of some of the the language of these texts
 as well as the language of true prophets, Terry's
 in one sense I do think that it is speaking to a different culture so people from like the Western World it can you know like they say you know you have a cat and you pet it in the wrong direction you go the first Against the Grain and it's like it it's rough it's disturbing you know some of this language for go to the Western near if it sounds dogmatic whereas I think two there is a different culture in the East it's even to this day I'll give you a name you mentioned doctor so give me example of the impression that I get in India
 is that when you go to the doctor
the patient
 it's it's some
 I get the impression the doctor's or less used to being questioned by the patients in India as they are in America
 like it it's kind of like the patient in India has confidence that the doctor is so much better informed than them on this that there's just a kind of a natural openness
 to the doctor's orders
 whereas like in the West is kind of like a why this why that why why why do sometimes like you know go to the box even at the hospital to get her beak you know digging into to try to understand something better and then I get and it's sometimes I get a little bit of feeling like I was like why is he asking so many questions I have the answer to this one is new just accept them and so when we hear some of this I think it is a bit it is speaking a bit to another
call your papa just saying You must do this you must do that too much to the end and the body text Pete to the now now in the country continues to show proper he said well first of all this talk of this confidentiality he said this is very confidential information this is an interesting topic that met Nancy's going to talk about how one
 can pass through that door that gate of confidentiality that's about to come and he's going to go to certain to a certain text to speak to that which is Rupa goswami spotty rest and reaches into
 but first let's discuss this idea of confidentiality it's saying that this understanding this very personal understanding of divine love there's many practices there's many methods of yoga but this one is confidential he sang this one is harder to access fewer can access their some qualification there's some
entry point that one needs to pass through to understand this even though it's right there in the books you can just pick up the book and read about it for instance in the bug of agita Krishna speaking to Arjuna and in several places he's going to say or June and I'm going to speak to something confidential
 he'll use the word gruia like it in text 911 sabag of agita
 precious is this is Gru yatta Mom this is the most confidential knowledge right in text in the in the 15 chapter 6 of the last verse of the 15 chapters is what I share with you Arjuna past few verses that I just spoke is his Ghoulia to Mom's sjostrom this is the most confidential part of all of The Vedic scriptures of all the sacred text to how does one understand it he failed to find that to what is the Dorothy to that confidential
knowledge how does one pass through it is it is it the kind of things would find another path of yoga does one need to be very austere
 is wanting to be very renounce perhaps one needs to be born in the right family so that they've learned everything and in developed all the pass through all the right to some scars all the right rites and rituals so that they will understand this knowledge it has a lot to do with birth does it have to do with intelligence what is it that grants one that access and Crystal say he'll see different things but they it has nothing to do with those externals it has to do with the state of one's heart you know in 91 he says I'm going to speak is most confidential knowledge that you'll be able to understand Regina because you are under sue your that because you have no animosity no envious this within your heart therefore you'll be able to understand or in the fortune
he says that I'm going to speak to you this Russian Russian ultimum the greatest mystery in all this Greatest Secret why to your cuz back do seem a s h a t because you're my devotee and you're my friend because your heart is in the right place you'll be able to access this you'll be able to understand this what why here because we're again because we're talkin about
 it's very personal and it has to do with love
 and so doesn't matter renunciation is an important learning is not important. They're not important but they're not there. They don't make the significant difference
 it really has to do with how one's heart is situated that will grant them access to understand this knowledge it's what it's it's it's an interesting thing
in one of the comments that word was at Mrs in the hierarchical system autocratic because his mom so in that sense it's it's the ultimate hot and there are many statements which stated this is open for everyone that I know they're no impediments on the spot
 and yet there seems to be some kind of structure
 that is in a bit suspect to be hard
that is the
 this is the spontaneous arising of emotion
 is the cultivated development of emotion no doubt but then that is also now which is a glass of cultivation that requires a conscious discipline so you could say that it is a part of the heart that says it's open to everyone but then the hearts higher emotions me something spontaneously
 but many times do you need to be calculated conscientious
Ellen DeGeneres authority figures the lord of the institution about them movie The Specialist Sports movies weather report for Alita
 but through the tough discipline the coach insists on the Backstreet follow that lead becomes better and better and eventually.
 It's tough but it is meant for the glory of the athlete yeah yeah there's it when we're about to get to that like kind of like where the disciples just kind of giving up everything is it sounded what we're about to read is very demanding
but it's but being able well that again that access in the state of one's heart so much of it has to do
 with if I'm going to understand truth
 then I'm going to have to let go
 of the idea that there is no one Beyond me like there's no one better than me that there's no one Superior to me which can when our heart is not situated where we have a very hard time swallowing that a child may have a hard time understanding parents are superior to me and then they shut their heart off even though the parents have everything to offer to the child and I think they were there the the relationship between the Geva and the East Florida in a between the soul and in the Supreme so much of it has to do with the willingness to accept one's Constitution you know how to be open to that that in one since I'm very small and God is very great can I you know can I
can I accept that if I'm not willing to accept that then the other yoga pass can take me so far you know I can understand I'm Eternal for instance I can let go of material things but I can't enter into the realm of divine love until I accept who I am and who God is
 and so that's you know that in order to pass through that door of their that gate of confidentiality there has to be some willingness to accept all of the ones Envy or animosity has to be like oh that there's another that I'm that I submit to even through love so now we hear about how that same relationship is reflected in the relationship between the Gru and the disciples were their submission of course which is a terrifying idea so probably right here to practice but to yoga one must first
except a bona fide spiritual Master Sho Baraka goswami in his body rest and reaches into advises and this is very fundamental to the practice about to hear these these these texts that were about to read he says once first duty is to accept he quotes group out of shy at asthma this is these are the first steps in the practice of body is laid out by ripping a Swami probably summarizes them except ones first 2D
 is to accept a Bonafide spiritual Master gurupada shot at taking the shelter at the feet of the guru the student or disciple should be very inquisitive now this is important
 there's there's there's submission but there's a but that submission is with inquiry
 your thoughts on that
 Yes actually that whole Pakistan inquiry is in Decatur
individuality is not being suppressed or rejected it is to analyze to understand the way the guru is is the ultimate resource
 what our intelligence
 who is not someone to whom they outsourced our intelligence the Intelligencer activates when does indoctrination you guide me by the group
is the disciple becomes a more integrated more functional use of a good teacher you could say is that the
 the teachers try to make themselves redundant for the student
 the future is trying to educate this world in such a way that the student can make decisions without the presence of the teachers explain the bhagavad-gita what's the circles to a whole process of ethical reasoning and the whole point of philosophical analysis
ground and guide its ethical reasoning the point is
 that's of the guru the system is is meant to be empowering it is meant to be more like power transferring that other than power holding the disciple inquiry is for that purpose I obey you because you help me to make sense of Miami to do this in the early part of the commentary proper spoke to the confidentiality of divine love the confidentiality of bhakti
 now we're hearing about the method of Entry right if it's confidential if not everybody is able to pass through the
now we're hearing about how one does it begins with connection with the master right connection with someone their Advance on this through whom as you're saying one can acquire and in through the answers one's own ability to understand becomes becomes activated
 what work work work to hear is this this inquiry is definitely there but there's more than a crew this is a course
 coming straight out of bug of agita you know text 434 right that it matches you inquire from the group what is it time for tea party partying up repression data Haven you inquire but you also serve because again is the state of heart that that allows the entry it's not merely the information but it's the state of heart in which the information
rests or in which it is rooted all that that the real activation takes place so now we'll hear a bit about that in this is a very traditional model we're going to hear about a connection between Gore and disciple that's very one-on-one you know who is on the Block where the two are living together and some nuggets here that they should be very eager to decide which should be very eager to know the complete truth about tonight and arm that makes me very inquisitive they should be eager to know the complete truth the words group shushrusha mean that want you personally serve the spiritual master
 how so by giving him bodily Comforts helping him in bathing dressing sleep
eating and so on and now that I think of immediately to some people this may sound very strange but but
 first of all this is in the context of India like like how do you help someone made to eat you going to get the water for that you got to go to the well or go to the river and load up that you know bucket full of heavy water and you bring it to them not so that they don't have to go and do that themselves you don't you know wake up early in the morning go out in the cold pump a thing for the water go to River and then carry that all the way back to the house to The Bruery terreux rather than he have to do that himself you do that for him you know how do you help him dress you do you wash his clothes so you know you wash them you dry them you fold them with devotion you know so is it saying that again helping them assisting them in bathing and dressing and sleeping and eating you know you prepare the meals you serve the meals he says this is called
shoe shoe shine am a disciple should serve the spiritual Master as a menial servant and whatever that idea
 I live that and I really am I in my own life I really had the opportunity to live that and what it does I can tell you for sure what it does
 it's not that every disciple will have the I have the opportunity to live that life somehow the principle of that has to be alive and the and the connection between Greer and disciple but I like literally live that you know I would go and fetch the water you know I would prepare the meals and serve the meals you know I would fold the laundry and carry the bags and end in do so many menial services like this and I can tell you for sure
 at what it does
is it gets you entirely out
 of the mentality of seeking one's own Comforts in life which is kind of what a lot of us live in 24/7 and it kind of pulls you out of a world of selfishness and put you into a world where you are constantly giving you know and as you said if one has gradually built up that relationship of face and relationship of love
 then it comes naturally it comes happily
 but it also can be very challenging 21 independent 22 ones false sense of Independence or two ones
 false need for Independence or false need for external Comforts it's kind of like is sometimes it like I'm around like say your god brother
you are or your God brothers that are like personally serving your Guru red lights around us honey like
 like they'll be his quotes of people that cook for him or that the carry out different responsibilities for their kind of always on call you know sometimes literally they just sit outside the door and at any moment they're called upon hey take care of this take care of that and they really don't you know don't have their own schedule they don't say what you doing today I think I'll do this and then I'll do that know their kind of on the schedule of another person 24/7 I remember living that life myself and in although it's very demanding
 is somehow very purifying you know it it puts you in a in a state of awareness
 that's very different than that that we normally walk around with
 there's a connection between that and one's ability to read
leave this knowledge even you could receive the same instruction and it won't take Route
 in the same way it'll take root in the heart of one who's given up
 a false sense of Independence
 on call during his internship constantly on call next to you all the time and it'll go extremely tough. For my life as a Medical Professional Regulation hours but I'm very alert comes up so in one sense that that
people only giving $0.01 for something Beyond oneself it can be very demanding but you can also be ready cuz it's just another point when you mentioned about doctors in India don't feel comfortable being questioned Indian doctors are there in the Middle East in the healthcare industry know something is the accept this fact that dr.
 They they are. They can handle stress which actually is demanding but it's also use a moldy clothes service to the group
bad actually violets it is no one's own schedule and the gold spirituality comes out and all that is apart from the soul spirituality album Purity Springs yeah it is if there's a comment is send you one must be inquisitive and then you serve like this your inquisitive and you give up
 your selfishness you live for others and that combination if it is the two rubbing against each other the two connecting just like sometimes you have on a you go to the hardware store and they have these different kind of epoxy is different kind of like really strong Clues and you can see it has like two tubes that are together
 and each one has a different
ingredient and then when you push on it you can't put them together all otherwise he'll never they'll turn into the turn hard and I'll never come out of the tube
 so you push the tube and they both come out at the same time and mix and then you have a super strong epoxy you know when the two ingredients are brought together it becomes strong and similar you know it's it's it's it's what what's been said in Bhagavad Gita in text 434 what's being with proper. I would say he's alluding to hear start that he's speaking directly to Rubidoux Swami's instructions in
 ambati rest and reaches into it and it feels also that he's alluding to text 434 in in the Gita is that what Christians teaching is that this real knowledge is confidential even if someone teaches it to you it doesn't necessarily take root and you don't understand it and it doesn't activate without the right state of heart and that right side of heart is
cultivated through service
 and granted if you're serving someone who's on ethical if you're serving someone who hasn't passed through this process himself and develops selflessness themself then certainly there's going to be potential for
 for exploitation of for some sort of fraud you know in this process but if that person is is deeply selfless and if this is taking place in it in in in a in a context of a real authenticity
 and the combination of your inquiry in any receiving those instructions it'll be so much hated by the state of your heart when when the state of your heart has been purified through selflessness and not yourself insist on speaking of it but selfishness demonstrated through personal sacrifice and what to speak of that person sacrifices done in a very
personal way in with great care and sensitivity you know that the beginning of the Bible time we hear a ceutical Swami's chosen by all the stages of Miami sharanya to be the most capable of interpreting all the different teachings from these texts and providing the answers that they received it and they speak to his qualification right what is a Sonia because you were the gentle disciple of your words you've been blessed by them to be able to understand all these teachings so this is Keith it's not just learning it's not a Cadet is not merely academic there's an academic aspects to it
 but it's not the word that you used to gain was it's not activated in any mind in any heart that hard has to be
 situated right with with with humility with with selfishness with non envious in order for it to take root
classic Indian restaurant on East-West difference do ice creams for almost 10 years especially in America as I'm sure you know the first reaction is it's it's it's got to power its God through meditation reading the in the Eastern way of locating if somebody is at the top of a hierarchy the default assumption is that person is God Dead 2 proficiency either one could be right or wrong but we both said we were quick to assume
doubt he'll faces earth based on dominance or Glock 22c. That penalty is based on Proficiency in the disciple the stupid by that
 you hit the nail on the head right there that's perfect as I said yesterday you have a very excellent engineering mind and you're always able Academy write things very nice and thank you for that proof there do we have any tickets for today we do accepting and serving the guru is this
to success
 education not indoctrination how to think not what to think
 let the guru disciple relationship develop gradually step by step
 open the door of confidential knowledge we need a coach to rise to Glory do you have on your back and field hockey I had great coaches I love my coaches see that can I accept that God is greater than me I try I am not so small I have trouble with it
 let the guru guide and activate intelligence
 be on call as a menial servant 24/7 to melt away and Purity and selfishness
 cultivate the right state of heart to activate the epoxy
and fetch water with emotion okay
