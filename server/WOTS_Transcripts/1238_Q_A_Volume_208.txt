 * the weakest and went through teacher training for 2:00 about 4 years ago and discovered that there's actually eight limbs to yoga and that started taking my curiosity and quite a journey this year the rest
 are the Poconos
 I saw your interview with Rich Roll and came to wisdom of the sages emailed Mara
 Mercedes 1080 gmail.com
that's a love story that's a lovely story cuz you start off saying well I came off of a pretty heavy I thought she was going to say you know living on the streets are super
 are you got kids okay so you can relate to us cuz like we're getting older to what are your children think about you getting into all this Christmas stuff
 after they got over thinking I was in a cult I think they're happy for me that I think they find me more settled and more peaceful 22 okay are they really up there up there and out okay
 I have to say I only want I want to shout out to Rich W cuz he's rich
play Rich W she's okay she were doing good we haven't got it any longer had yet but we're working on it just crystallized stool growing out of your door senorita we can help you if you want to get rid of your ego yes or no I can help you load it on the show
 all right let's get that shit a question what you question my friends Isaiah Temple have you been to the temple in Chicago the okay did you feel a little like I don't know what to do
 the other
 coming well stressful did do you feel pressured by the people there okay you just felt
use some information that's a good question like what the heck am I doing here I feel like everyone got the memo except me where do you learn the memo where do you get even get the memo requesting first thing is take off your shoes that's a big one take off your shoes in the sample it's weird because sometimes I go to a church and a walk in as I get to where I'm staying
 I think first we should talk about what you're doing in the temple and then otherwise the rules to sound totally arbitrary and all that right. Do you remember my god brother gopal Raj
 where was he famous for cooking
when you were they solved this whole family is brother's whole family and then Mohan who made me who made the entire train champ Harry Krishna tried to get me to do it to us at the old he's going to fall off or you so anyway this gopal Raj he stayed with my group when he was in Cambridge my girls going to Cambridge University go by was kind of a cook for him and they went together to some old Cathedral there you know some of those Cathedrals are beautiful so you know it's in here part you know he grew up in India per I never seen the cathedral like that yeah and then afterward my grass and what do you think the church
 he said it was very beautiful but where was the DD
 in other words the words dealing they're not in other words is the temples in any of their not just like gathering places like like if you go tomorrow
to Hindu it seems it's very empty and a church can feel that way too because the whole idea is that God is in one sense God is present everywhere but we have trouble seeing you know we walk around totally out of touch with that we walk around you know maybe we believe that in our heart but it's kind of like if we're to calculate how much of the time remembering that it's very little stay until we get we just caught up we get caught up in the world the temple at the ideas there that God can be present in a in a form that you can meditate on that you can see with your eyes and insolent and through that type of meditation you meant to be able to go out into the world and see God everywhere see God in everything in the heart of every living being in someone so it's it's a meditates a place to meditate it's it's a place for ritual what ritual is meditative to you know so like in in the in our Temple as a Radha Krishna Temple is that you'll see in Northern
India and now thanks to she'll probably keep kind of establish them all around the world the ideas that of radha-krishna are installed there through ritual that you called to say please accept this form and in that that form will give us the opportunity to meditate on you and to offer service to you too to focus on you and and so that's what's so when you come into the temple is kind of like you're coming in to krishna's house kind of like rotten Christian are like the important people that you're going to see and the D on the etiquette or the rules that are there they're meant to help us keep that in mind so that we're not sore that we're not missing the whole point of the trans we're not experiencing the transformation that were meant to experience
 so for instance
 when you're standing in the temple and
the DD's of radha-krishna one thing is you just don't talk idly because even say was any let's say you met like a really important person like you went there to have a special audience with them you probably wouldn't just start talking idly in front of them you would be like I'm here to see you you know what either important things that I would like to say important conversation like to have with you if you have that kind of reverential mood you're not just going to be chit-chatting about anything's so so that so that's kind of two to help us Garner the right words had to help us some cultivate cultivate keep in mind
 what we're doing and how are you doing that's so so you have 11 is generally when you walk into town from this a bell there was part of the whole thing and I think it's important to say that no just brought in for a second sometimes the doors are closed and you
I see the DVDs so you have to find it in the temple but the door to the altar is close to alter his clothes so you have to find out from the temple when is the darshan it means when God gets to see you and you get to see God and then also there is an rrt which is the time they actually ring the bells and offer the in Santan off of the gay lamp and it's nice to go during that time as well sometimes people I could just check in with the deities in the course of the day and they develop like a relationship with the deities who becomes almost like I want to check in today on my lunch my lunch break I want to come in and check in and sometimes like when you go to someone's house people need to bring something so you bring like a sack of rice is a nice thing people throw a sacrifice on the altar in the precincts of taking it sometimes the priest gives you something back nor do they give me back and then the boy what's its significance to that cuz it's the first shot it's the remnants of the Lord
 meaning that the Lord warrants I bless
did I last wore the Lord where the Garland they give it back to you sometimes in India when you go to a temple very often you a buy a Garland they sell Garland's outside they're really cheap and he go into the Garland you just go to the priest and sometimes the priests will put it on immediately and give you another one back that's already been warned America we don't get that thing I'm ever going into a temple with like eight of my students as I come on we're going to buy garlands and bring them inside so we know about these garlands around they're all wearing the same we want to cook for a Krishna you want to offer Krishna fresh flowers to so people like to offer flowers you don't see that so much in America where you but people sometimes can bring flowers if you want to also if you grow flowers that's nice some people live in a place we can grow fruit or flowers or fruits
so yes you find out when the Arctic is and in Harry Krishna iskcon Temple set up a prop but it generally have some type of public service at least once a week and that usually on a Sunday at some times of Sunday evening or Sunday afternoon but they might have if you get very connected with the temple you'll find all there's a bug of it it every morning there's stuff going on early every morning there's a sort of like a little bit more of a in in her house paying rent house program which everybody is invited to but sometimes I feel like an evening class or something like that the more you get connected with that Community but you know it's always fun and I was going to the temple of Brooklyn when I was younger but I don't know anybody so I was like you people are people are saying I was just going I didn't know what they were saying no one told me what to do and we told me what about I didn't know what I was mumbling when I was buying I was saying in class the other day is like I was so spaced out like I didn't even realize it was an all
what is a go-around I didn't know we were focused at something he's like I would you think that. Sounds like I missed the whole thing you're looking for like a black outfit in a little while and then there's a Tampa was just seems like another people moving around and I find it very difficult to choose that was younger I just couldn't sit still looking around go in the gift shop coming back on back in the gift shop looking around more I'd like missed the entire strip but I will say it's very confusing even I'm especially like the Sunday please because it's like it seems like everybody knows what they're doing except me so it's nice to go with a friend who does know and they can give you some clues or you could just say hey you got call a Paige finally bought tea in Chicago
 Cameron perhaps
it's nice to go in and bow when you go to the store and that's what you do first thing you walking bring the Bell Bowser's hello I'm coming in and it's nice to have a prayer to Christian ask something to be getting for the date he's more like what do we say I love you when you greet someone the first daylight but like we're glad she was here today show Rick Fletcher came over the first thing I go to greet regular can you give me something actually give me job can you give me girl from police brick it is it
 you don't go and just start throwing your desires on God but you offer a prayer of appreciation until this very very beautiful prayers you could learn you could say some prayers for the Brahma samhita you could say I could sit down in the temple and peace if there's no one there except you you just read a chapter of the bug of agita there
inquietude yeah you know just a little bit more about like what's really happening there so I can sew on that altar
 the idea is it's like the rituals are done all day but sometimes the doors are open sometimes they're closed and it's kind of like
 they're they're feeling the presence of God in the form and it says if God were guests in that place and they're saying okay God we won't you come we want you to stay here while you to live here we want to serve you and so meditative ritual to meditative ritual offerings are made every day just like okay wake up you know he's woken up with music in with my beautiful prayers he's put to sleep with music and beautiful prayers food offerings are made it's it's even there just like a whole list of offerings like throughout the day you know now please have a seat you know let me offer you something to drink let me know if your Garland of flowers or some
oils and some incense Setter Setter so it is kind of like the same please got to stay and reside here in this space so the space can be safer to assume can connect with you here but it's also like I said there's a extra one in on the internal those rituals in bed to be like dear God please reside here in my mind and heart that that's the connection is always meant everything is going on external don't understand that that's what it's limited to its even
 Yogi's will do all of those same ritual sitting quietly alone without any Temple to get the same internal effect right the external just helps may be reinforced it but really he's all about inviting God into the mind and into the heart so that when I walk out of the temple I feel the presence of God in my mind and in my heart and I and I see that everywhere now there's if you go to South send you the ancient temples in South India
 the design of them is like the Moon
food in which they worship God there's referential usually psych Lord Vishnu that they're worshiping or others other ones but did the mood is always right and that you would have to wait in a long line commonly especially the big famous popular toys these long lines back and forth on here in a waiting. To go through security in a thousands of people come to have a quick word with God in the temples of radha-krishna like in Northern India they were designed different they were designed workers goddess
 our goal is to relate to God and in a more person that person away and so they were designed so that you could spend a lot of time there so it's like they would have big open courtyards or in our temples like in the west that they're endorse but just like big open space so you can sit there and you can look like we're going to say and it's a beautiful
even on one verse that you can come before God and say with sincerity you know give us a Brahma samhita verse unless I had missed your call Publix in your world built of how many stones magical touchdowns last picture where you are served by hundreds of thousands of gopis and locksmith
 I worship you I worship. Govinda I think the cows cows such as that beautiful Govinda whom I adore that original be so it's so did their songs.
offering prayers that have already been written and chanted been handed down for thousands of years or whether it's just offering since your prayers and your thoughts opening yourself up speaking of God sharing your sharing your heart with God opening up that relationship or tending the rituals and selves festivals the talks their butt singing in a tone it's our place to go and be with God that's why we're so when do Power Ride came out of that church has a very beautiful eyes but I didn't see God for him was just like missing the man it's a man of that it was like you're going to stay there when there's no band tonight I don't know if there's so many rules
 but I like I like you could pour out your heart to God like you're like you're talking to a therapist also afterwards he also asked how are you
what's going on in my life you can tell I want a relationship or you just tell us what's going on in my life what do you think I am open to any direction I was asked question whatever you want me to do please let me know give me some whisper or give me some loud direction and you know
 I think if you if you're there and you want to know more you can always just look around and see what kind of vibe you're getting from different people try to find out how to find a good vibe going so you know I'm kinda new here and I'm just wondering if I'm doing things right could you just tell me a little bit about what happened with the Flaming lamp and put it to your forehead are you going to have any touch the front of the Tesla fire
 does that help
 okay I'll see you don't see with your feet you're sitting and every at your feet and that's a good thing
defeat of showing usually cover your feet too often times I can do a skirt and cover it over Doty you don't touch somebody with your feet is a bad one too what else to step over and I'm stepping on people
 what else
 hell yeah. Yeah I don't have your back to the DTs when you're sitting still usually the speaker will sit on the side of the center of it the attention yeah
 okay it's pretty good thank you for the question the question lost on the list of queues today
 Narayan he come on down there I need from Germany lives in Switzerland
 noorani she's a longtime Zoomer maybe one of the oldest zoo one of the oldest we have
 not age-wise but but
 haven't I tried
yes I listen to super-soul secret santa were you here in India when we started the podcast yes you were here from day one that's pretty exciting for one day and it was weird but we're little disappointed with time and it's okay it's okay we love you you're part of the team how are you how can we serve you
 I love you thanks thanks for being my teachers I was thinking since I'm very fortunate I'm coming to my oppose you guys yet have you ever been to Tuesday with us have you ever been in a Ryan have you ever been before yes that's why it's short but not the way the guidance of you guys
that's what we like to do when I took curate a trip to be loving you is so big you could just wear like get lost walking around there so we can cure it and experience
 but your question
 I was wondering if you could tell us a little more about to Tanya and what's so special about him question
 okay you want to start a regular Ensure
 whenever you're ready say Tanya is so special because
 is the reason why we're all into this in the first place because Jay Tanya is the Yuga Avatar Avatar at this age and he came to he came to give the simplest process of self-realization through sound through kirtan the chanting and Iggy
easiest
 to the most unqualified
 why are we are qualified or just a bunch of dented cans were broken or Brokenness with people admit it till I'm so broken or I'm a I'm a mess and I can't keep everything to get it in Cali ago we have no qualifications we have nobody carries and when you hang out and do you seal on these people are very certain people are you just meet there's like these guys are so qualified and then you see it like how we grow up and we thought oh my gosh people showing qualified yet something as simple as sound vibration can change your Consciousness so fast and simple now it's you'd be when you do the negative sound vibrations when you criticize people find fault with people gossip that sound vibration is so degrading nobody feels clean
 you speak good about people appreciate people that sound vibration those are also type of monster is in the mind and make you feel better about yourself then and better.
then you have these Transit Dental sounds which are like Houghton imported sounds that are out of this material world that's what they're called they say there are imported from the spiritual realm goloka Primadonna how do you know imma send Cortana it's not of this world and if you associate with those sounds like in the same way of you associate with
 the sounds of
 Bob Marley say he might inspire you in a spiritual way that's right right
 oh it's so funny last night we were with an old friend of ours Latina Shakti grew up in Brooklyn used to have big long dreadlocks you know he was he was into the hole he told Bob Marley back in the 70s
years ago I was asking what do you think about Bob Marley and and he practically had Bob Marley on like the noordam uni platform very deeply relax so so what do you think about all the pot smoking the rest of partying to have their sacraments so there's any way those sound vibrations changes right just like a Beretta Metallica concert is a culture that comes with the sound if and there is there's something very potent about associating with Divine sounds and that's one thing you will learn very quickly by either Channing the holy name or being around kirtan or playing Vishnu sahastranaam or playing these in a beautiful Sanskrit mantras it's the change the Consciousness it cleanse The Ether and
if you don't believe me enter the experiment like make a commitment the chant one round of Joppa add a Soma Hopper bow ratchathani of the Great Master he gave this and he wanted it spread to all people whether they are qualified or unqualified and he wanted us to take it into the streets called mug are sunk your tongue where you take the more dunga and the cartels and you just go through the streets and sing and they say that that sound is so pure it doesn't just purify you it purifies every living entity ID to me that doesn't just appear by anybody hears it
 purifies the beings that here at like the trees and the plants and the animals so she tell you was an incredible person at the very least they would say that the stories will say when he was a child prodigy then other people would say we all know he was actually a missed it cuz they show many stories christ-like Miracles he would perform but his intimate closest followers said this person
The Way We Were
 wassup realize gurus in their own right very very prolific authors and their own right hundreds of followers in their own right they say this person is an avatar we've never met anybody like them to the point where
 biography many biographies were written about him when someone does something great even in the material world we've developed this thing called Apple Computers will be a great to read his bio. Came up with Apple Computers when someone like Jay Tanya did what he did
 all and even understand what it's like to write a biography five hundred years ago you're riding this thing on Palm leaves and it was capped for Generations passed down from teachers to disciples it was quite a mystical being and what I love about it was he made the very very enigmatic mysterious
Hindu what we do is Hinduism he extracted just the essence and that's what we are at think Americans are good with we want to know what the what is behind all this stuff just like the last question of Laura from Chicago where are these rituals about we want to know why I'm battling why I'm waiting by the incense clockwise instead of Clan while I'm touching the flame who are these figures on the altar what what are we supposed to be doing what was the thought process behind seeing them to say a prayer do I ask them for money what what is happening here so we want to get to the bottom of this and she Tony extracted just essential teachings of what can be very confusing of Hinduism or realize I was India's themselves are a little confused and it is quite mysterious
 want to add on to this yeah sure do thank you
 I was thinking I don't think we were some
we should just come straight out and say that we understand that shoot your tongue is Cristiano right within the Traditions play Krishna was here 5000 years ago she continues her five hundred years ago but it's Krishna and is in a very special and unique way and a very special and unique mood and this is something that I want that I I pray for the day that I just understand just how special it is that he appeared in this way and that we had was somehow Fortune of to connect with him when we do realize it will just cry and cry and cry
 in a good way to sad just the opposite good cry cry may be ugly cry but good ugly cry a little ugly but you know we're talkin about Divinity in like how we can see.
you know how going to Temple should help us see Divinity you know that when we said Namaste right okay I recognize the Divinity in you ride your body is a temple of God God is in your body I honor that and then we know then there's so many different ways that God manifests there's different avatars and so on but we would say that the most specialized is Krishna the origin of it all right if it's Shri Krishna that beautiful boy from whom comes the Vishnu incarnations what you're So Glorious and beautiful magnificent but he's the source of all that and he manifests the most beautiful moods and all the gods and goddesses and all that they're all stemming from One Source in that street Krishna
 Sochi Christmas special
 but treat your tongue as we sometimes we call him Avatar but he's a little different he has Cristiano use that same origin
 but he's that same origin in a very very special mode
and Christian is mood is sweetness Reddy's is full of sweetness
 switch attorneys that same person
 but his predominant mood is compassion
 and this is the thing in this is the this is like the really esoteric aspect of this box etiology that Krishna realizes something that Rod huh right router the goddess his own energy but but with her own will in her own croissant as appreciate she is the personification of Love talk to you love her Krishna
 he recognizes that the experience of loving God
 is even more overwhelming than the experience of being God Loved by the body we give a good analogy and I'm going to but in but it's going to make a lot of sense you know how Irene
realize this thing because when I was in the band in a band and I get up on stage and people you know when people are excited to see if they're all like going
 sometimes on stage I'll be like what are you getting these people are enjoying this more than I'm actually I'm not actually enjoyed it that much they're like really happy that Krishna is wondering like what's it like for the devotee to feel that love I want to taste that love that's the one thing you can't feel but that's the one thing that only his devoted can feel he's not interesting I think that's very interesting something sometimes you can say also like a mother is holding the baby right and the babies feeling a mother's love and its do you know you can see the babies all please and Anna this is great but the mother's feeling something far more you know she's just her heart is totally melting you know so that it said that to be there's the object of love
 that do the one
the love is directed at and there's the subject or the Shrine of the Abode of the love ended the one that's holding the love in the heart for the for the object of blood and it said that the experience for the deadliest schreier the shelter though the The Vessel that's holding the love it's an experience it's more deep and Rich and so is he saying like Rada loves me God
 I don't know what that I don't know what it's like to hold love of God loves of Krishna in my heart and she's experiencing I'm fascinated by that what that must be like the only one way he can do it is to come as a devotee of Krishna so it comes to shoot your Tanya but he's Krishna in the mood of Radha he's Krishna feeling the emotions feeling the love of Krishna that Radha holes in her heart and this is really important for the for the for the vice numbers for the box of yogis our whole goal is to reawaken this love for God in the heart and when that love is pointing it at God
we call the Prima which means I forgot but when that same heart with that same love is pointed at the rest of the world
 it manifests as compassion they say eldaria right did the love that a lover of God
 feels in the heart when it's playing a God that's one thing when you take the same loving you pointed at the rest of world is called compassion
 I was talking about that last night after you left Mirage I said let you know different people to speak and I sent you to look at this project the governor on eco Village
 it's all dedicated to loving Krishna
 but at the same time and in the hearts of the people that live in serve here is nourished day-by-day and in that love for God is deepening in their hearts everyday
 but when they turn around and they engage with the all the local Villages then
Memphis is compassion it's like how can we share with you and so they do so much for everyone around now with SRI chaitanya comes he's got the ultimate love cuz he's got his love in his heart and when he turns and looks at the rest of the world has got the ultimate compassion right like the old blood beyond beyond compassion and so that's goes back to a drug run through saying was like you know if you read all the different yogic literature
 it's all giving instructions about how you can advance how you can become free from the the programming of the Mind from all your bad habits from all your Bad Karma going back light enough to lie to his lifetime being stuck in a cycle of some sorry that goes around and around around you got to become the super renounce you know yanny or this incredibly disciplined Yogi to break the cycle
 and Krishna comes along and says you know you don't have to do that all that you could just surrender to me here's an Express train
Express train you just surrendered give your heart to me and you bypass all of that I can that that's incredible Mercy but shoots a ton is even more just here this month or just sing this manttra right just just Champions names just engage in this music you know it and not only will I give you a liberation
 I'll give you the the purest deepest love of God the intimate love that the residents of Madonna had he's coming and he's trying it's like it's like if someone busted out of like Tiffany's would like tons of Drew is here take this and I don't know if I want to know how it just takes awhile how much does it cost just take it and I'm giving it to you that's the idea that he's got this is Christian coming in this with his deepest love and the steepest compassion and he's just sharing it there's no question of
 misbehavior or bad past or anything like that
not even seen any of that he's he's just bypassing all of that and just say take this I'm giving you something so special that's why I say when we realize it will cry will be like Emily. I'm so undeserving in this unbelievable exactly historically it was a historical moment that and it's hard to even understand right now but if you could imagine if it was today tenured professors at Harvard giving up everything and moving to the Jungle billionaires walking from their way from their fortunes you know queens or in a first ladies leaving their spouses and also moving to the Jungle learn to tell you how this affect where people are giving up everything in from all over India and moving to this ancient Holy Land
 I'm practicing Bajan or the worship of Krishna and it was almost like they were possessed by Spirit but it was happening
turn it three newspapers it was somehow spreading by early and bring David was a hub for bhakti 500 years ago and the center of that the the the Hub of the wheel that box was SRI chaitanya and it was an incredible time historically
 sounds like a great time is the right time I might have been there I might have been doing some simple activity I had to take birth again so punk rock singer and then met the devotees and now I'm saving this life it would be want to come back again it's really don't want any sort of do see how everybody's doing okay I really feel like we are in a box a tsunami right now Renaissance
whole thing about Brahman dear India's losing their mind everybody's obsessed with Lord ROM and such a wonderful way now we are just before the show me the stewardess flying through and not answer grandma YouTube there's so many like that so many young and singer Dan on the Indian singers and bands that have taken traditional bridge by John's and Ron Bhajan and turn them into palatable like not like foreign-sounding music with stuff that any ear could appreciate music like Papa John near Duboce leessang and they've got millions of followers it's unbelievable and then you meet these young people like really young people who are just Lucid how you clear a children little children how little little generation second generation or these people growing up in devotee families from around the world
India and it's like oh I get it yet the Masters are taking birth right now all over the planet there has to be something it's almost like an alcoholic they have to hit a rock bottom to Spring off the bottom to go higher and we are in a world that's collapsing and it might just take a collapse and apocalypse or people just losing their marbles for a certain demographic to say no I want light I don't want to hate anymore and I think this is maybe how things seem so crazy it's all a preparation for Lord's sake Tini to walk right down the center aisle and bring and rescue us I'm in Prophecy do you know but I do think I think sometimes when I think let's just talk historically right then when sure the proper came to the West stork
he came without any help you know I was just watching a clip of a scholar at a conference that was recently held at Harvard University for the 50th anniversary of discount okay and this collar was he was comparing Sheila Prophet to Muhammad and to Jesus Christ and he was talking about all the advantages that Muhammad is Jesus Christ had over proper they have what they were working there working in their own home turf their home turf where the people already had a face that likes that was connected to what they're presenting okay he was giving a whole list of things I don't know right now and then he said proper came here they were speaking to people that are qualified and and you know well established in so probably speaking to just young hippies on drugs on drugs that he was he was all alone he had no backing of funding he was presenting
entirely foreign to them to import an entire culture yes language use a crick out your food he gave them everything and it did it in 10 years he went around the world and spread it around the whole world and it keeps expanding and it's growing as growing Legacy planning a sea like planning an egg corn that's going to grow a tree a massive tree that's going to give tens of thousands of more egg corn and it's just going to keep going round it up or did you to keep going right yes and end and so I think of the early followers the show The Profit everyday crazy things are unfolding like Oh The Beatles are suddenly into this
 that's another now like all these people are just getting interested in this like crazy wherever you look far out things are unfolding
and I know that cuz I know people that were there at the time they were like we're going to just take over this world and just a matter of a short time and then I can imagine you know then probably left in 1977 in like any
 you don't quote unquote new religious movement not that not that the body was new workout vaishnavism was nobody was at Westamerica so it's called in an RM new religious movement like any new religious movement when the founder goes then it struggles for some time and even though it's kind of has definitely had his struggles I mean when we got into it it was like probably a lope and it was that it was a bottom. We got into it so all that being said you know at that point I'd imagine all these people like we thought it was just going to take over everything and now we're getting older and it didn't
I think what you're saying is is right on it's just that the world is moving in a certain way and these all those all those device with dedicated their lives to to understanding the pricing and teaching and spreading bhakti they're all they're all having kids and those kids are having kids like right now we've got right here with us now we've got friends here that our second generation that have the third generation little kids tumbling around at 3rd generation devotees was all led by a second-generation devotees ghorbani almost my age may be any Jollibee
 the Bali and Krishna Kishore who's got you like the Rolling Stones of kirtan and their kids are going to be even Panic is going better
the Balian Kishore an investigation playing three yeah they've been doing to your time together since they were little and bar was walking around with potty otra when he was 3 years old lady walking around the holy places in and you were saying like you know you we just flipping on YouTube as I do yours like two girls they look like they're bad at 8 and they're singing Krishna Bhajan with incredibly like really well and millions of followers and millions of followers so you know I'm convinced that buck buck tea is it makes too much sense to attract is too attractive I think I think real serious Christians will start because you know what this makes all kinds of what are all those people that's there the growing demographic of people that say I'm spiritual but not religious talk to you is going to click all the boxes for them it's beautiful it's culture has got a depth of wisdom to it right food it's got a wonderful culture and friendly and it's trance
sending all the negative aspects of religion that turned me off grade outfits Urban's see that it can explode the flowers it can explode and and and and it will happen in ways that these do these original devotees that they can't even imagine it will be 28 year old girls that can sing like crazy that like that that attract like hundreds of thousands even millions of people think about think about this think of the festival's we do another friend Ivan Temple they fill the whole sunken Courtyard with water throw flowers all over the water in designs and then make a little boat and they pull the deities on a boat crazy is that and how far is that they may put the DVDs on a swing and they swing the deities how crazy and fun is that until you think that's I think that could attract a lot of people
anyway I see it happening I don't know if we'll see if how much will see it unfold in our life but I say we we work like it's going to act like it's going to get to be part of that tsunami yeah and then maybe come back in a week and I'm back and yeah maybe our children other point is that the same people that like all we didn't accomplish it in our lifetime that's okay you can come back come back come back
 without without all of the the, you entered the previous life is short right just have a power you know just just like with Purity with power and just influence you know that is in 6 chapter of Bhagavad Gita says those who've been practicing yoga for a long time you know the person to take birth and a family of yogis so from the very infancy they're getting traded all these rituals munchers Poudre is don't you as youngsters in in in in in in
