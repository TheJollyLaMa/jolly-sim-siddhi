 happy to be here with you guys I just seen you in India
it looks like two more dunga's back there huh there's so many but I guess that character there's three and my son wakes up first thing in the morning Papa we got to keep on like ready to go you know Daniel born into a devoted family and her father is from what I hear from what I understand in Venezuela he's like as famous as anyone that keeps like a hugely popular musician the correct Venezuela Ilan Chester to self into the Maya Parise who's who's who's who's music we played the end of every show for people that like love to me is all the time we get comments like what is that music at the end
can I find that so that's the my place so it's a lot of more done good in your life it is only when I'm asked to play the feel like I'm not as capable as I could be till I teach my son so I feel like I need to look up my game I feel like they're not enough notice is that in my insufficient but I am sure you do enough for your son and he's got plenty of the younger teachers all around you know we had a question question was sent in from one of our age group leaders bhaktavatsalam who's an old friend of mine you know back in my days as a barometer is a monk we you and I spent a lot of time together and see your friend now he leaves of one of our Sage group
 which are groups that you can join that if you want to go deeper into this they meet once a week the small groups usually like seven or eight people in a group they get together every week once a week and
not for about an hour and a half or so they just said to Scott Disick you know that it's a place for Sangha it's a place for connecting with people for if you listen to the podcast you want to go deeper to place where you can make some friends that are into this a place where you can ask your questions place where you can present your doubts or your struggles it's it's it's for sunga and he share this question that I'll read to you all and Indian listeners may be picking up already that I've brought two people in that have some counseling experience and when I heard this question as I can. Nothing I didn't answer this question. So I wanted to bring on her friends so here we go here ice ice age group is fortunate to have two wonderful members who are second generation but the Oggi's as well as clinical psychologist as Generations me just like we're speaking of Dona that their parents practice about to be an Indian second or third and we don't know how many
Generations goes back in many families to practice Buffy but since he was brought to the West in the 60s and 70s now there's a lot of 2nd and gradually 3rd Generation that he sang with in his group to two people that were born into bhakti yoga families
 that also practice Clinical Psychology within our discussions the issue of mental health has come up they have observed the propensity for devotees for bhaktiyog he's too much more readily approach metaphysical solutions to relatively common clear-cut mental health conditions such as autism spectrum disorder bipolar disorder or clinical depression rather than seeking allopathic Western Medical help okay and as we go through the site I wanted to clarify if I if I understand the question why he's used the term metaphysical Solutions I think it's it's something
the broader than that because it seems like as we read
 he's indicating that people that have an interest in bhakti the practice Bucky devotees that they are prone to more readily approach solutions that have to do with I in my mind is two categories one is just having faith that the practice of buck itself will solve the mental disorder
 or two approaches like are you Veda which are ancient you know ancient we would call them Sciences although many maybe modern Dave mental health professionals might not see them as valid they might be entirely unfamiliar with him but it seems to me those are the categories so I can think of multiple examples where this is occurred and the results of range between quite negative to catastrophic
not just in terms of the person spiritual life but also their mental health as well so both suffered their their their spiritual life suffered the mental health suffered due to not approaching allopathic Western Medical help
 the intersection between mental health and emotional life is an interesting subject there has been a bit of work done within the movement on this I merely think of Revenge Jurupa Boo and his cure of souls seminar series that was given some years ago quite a few years ago I think that was sometime in the early to mid-90s that was a that was a series of talks given on the work of Cooper T-Pain do remember the name
 the food that was there the writings that was based on a Catholic priest that the father of modern clinical pastoral care chaplain
that is one of The Inspirations for me to go into chaplaincy is that where the term Dark Night of the Soul originated in his writings or did he just right on that's a good st. John of the cross I think it's okay that we might face on the spiritual path in and how they can either be
 springboard's for Rapid spiritual advancement or how they can kind of be kind of insurmountable obstacles depending on how they're approached okay so so he mentioned that he says other spiritual Traditions have explored this is well multiple questions arise in my mind about this team but I'll try to limit it to one or two to hear the questions to what extent and I think I'll just read them all
 and then we can do
start approach them to what extent
 are The Vedic metaphysical Arts still alive and well in this age
 and how much should we rely on them when getting a diagnosis or treatment for suspected mental health condition is there quackery in this field okay to at what point do we consider it spiritual bypassing to be looking first at metaphysical solutions to mental or physical health issues we wouldn't rub a crystal to treat a broken leg and although some mental health circumstances are subtle some have clear-cut recognized physical or historical trauma cause ality for which there are recognized treatments why have intermediate I'm going to say why have indeterminate sometimes fuzzy metaphysical approach has become our first go to for mental health issues
 do you think that mental health issues are more stigmatized
open spiritual communities as opposed to mainstream Society it would be interesting to hear a devotee mental health professional perspective on this cat we have some here with us today as cynicism from materialist about spiritual practitioners being deluded or mad created a paranoia about mental health to those practicing spiritual life
 what were Shula Pro pods instructions on this I know that since he passed on some instructions have been taken out of context and used to justify questionable practices
 at The Intercept at the Inception of the body moving in the west even within mainstream Society attitudes and knowledge around mental health or still fairly regressive to what extent have we belong to those outdated attitudes and what are some of the current Progressive success stories in this field thank you so that wasn't to question those question for you and it's the end of the white topic thank you again for your wonderful service for having
maturities to Holcomb complex reality of trying to understand the practical application of serious spiritual life in a fairly dystopian world
 you okay and so is your some complimentary things here but.
 He says
 ee says
 and he said you were the masters of contextualizing about the practices in philosophy thank you and making spiritual life not just relatable but the obvious Panacea for the conflict catastrophe and confusion beside you based on bike okay thank you so much so so what we start here and maybe I can hear from both of you on the subject maybe we can begin with cool a pretty poor boo boo in and then hear from Tanya but it seems to me like there's a fundamental there's one basic fundamental question behind all these questions
and it speaks to me it could be categorized in different ways you could say it speaks to one's faith
 or naivete you know it however you want it however you want to categorize it but one could ask
 we hear through the back to text somebody in the text on yoga there's kind of like you could say their claims made in in the sacred texts that we read in one sits in a basic way when we speak of a Dunta there's the idea that are suffering in this world is due to a misidentification right because identify with the body I am a true I'm an eternal spark of blissful spiritual energy by nature and I am misidentifying with a body and a mind that are composed of material energy and the nature of the material energy that it's always shifting so my steady happiness which is my nature
becomes a lost I lose touch with it when identify with that which is in constant change going through constant Cycles so if we simply address that misidentification then suffering subsides
 we become free of suffering when we cease to identify with the body and the mind and and also it when we get to like bhakti vedanta you know is still more is claimed that through connecting stood not identifying with the body mind and identifying as the Eternal loving servant of the root of all existence of Krishna that not only do we become free from depression and anxiety fear
 but we also developed the deepest spiritual ecstasies the we we we become in touch with it the deepest spiritual ecstasy which is our own nature through love so if that's a fact
 then shouldn't be the
just threw these practices about the as their prescribed
 by the great of Charlie's by the great teachers in this tradition should that not be enough
 to overcome whatever mental health issues that I have if if if I seek answers to those to those mental health issues to Modern forms of therapy
 is it an indication that my fate my faith is weak is it an admission that the process doesn't work at how do how do we view that so I'm very curious to hear from people that are deep and longtime practices practitioners of body as well as people that work professionally in them the field of mental health so you know what you don't have to answer the whole question but let's just get the conversation started
 I guess I was one thing that struck me
turn the question is that from my
 from my perspective is a hospital chaplain that's like being a chaplain and spiritual care in the hospital has kind of come out like it's come a long way but today's hospitals and the medical do the view of lake Kerr is like more holistic and multidisciplinary and so they acquire there has to be a special care Department in hospitals well there's something for the Joint Commission which reviews all hospitals and depending on what tier what level of functionality level in the highest level of wires that there is a chaplaincy department that represents All Phase I'm sure that what was that organization or is called The Joint Commission so a part of the American Medical Association or something like that it's every hospital has to go through this so I know if it's Federal but it's it's a it's the standardized
Quality quality assurance of hospitals every buddy has to think there's some kind of regulatory Department that make sure that all hospitals meet the standards that's required in any way that people look at Madison are look at how is including a spiritual care aspect to it now that's in hospitals and unusual lot of times in hospitals could I just asked do you know exactly how long that's been a requirement like what year that was instituted I thought I'd say probably at least since
 about 2 probably at least the 90s like a standardized way to centralize what I may have been different independent
quality control air quality assurance things but it may be actually even before that but it's I mean it's regulation of hospitals standardized standardized across petals so so even though the Western mental health professionals are recognising the need for you as an answer to mental health issues without that you know I think in our him pee pee and it was the opposite the balance was like yes we are spirits Community we're like we need it also means maybe a joint commission to make sure that there's a little bit of a services within our communities to make sure that there was also mental health and you know medical help support emotional support even yeah things like Financial family family some
children helping support four children and things like that so in other words for what what's being brought up in the question is like you did but the joint commission may been found it then but that doesn't necessarily mean that this requirement for Spiritual care within hospitals was established that I have I can't say what it was but I have seen I have looked up the requirement for Spigen departments and hospitals with the Joint Commission it is in there it is in there are standards required so that the question was was observing something that's it and by the way I want to preface this by saying when we speak about like say
 the Krishna Consciousness movement in or like the term movement was used there so I assume that's you know that's what I was speaking to wear the bra terbukti Global community
it's it's different in different places and even in the same city of different communities people that understand it and practice it with different attitudes. So someone since we can just we have to be careful how we generalize here but he was recognizing something real that has a tendency that he saw four people deep in the bhakti practice to less a minimize to admit perhaps even avoid more modern kind of approaches and you're saying that
 perhaps is two communities that are maturing simultaneously that that that did the modern that the modern world of therapy is recognizing the need for Spiritual counseling and the spiritual community may be recognizing the the the practicality the practical application
of modern techniques yeah yeah yeah and I are educational programs development of them for students yeah they're there is a
 the thing is that I'm spiritual bypass
 it's it's true it's that it's a real it's a it is a problematic occurrence when things that happened but I think being careful to make sure that it just doesn't invalidate like spirituality cuz that's why I was saying coming from the hospital Viewpoint like it's almost like we were we were bypassed in a different way like chaplaincy spiritual bypassing so I think it's also important to note that you no ads
 it's
just because we're you know we're almost like the positions of spiritual care where than we would be the experts of that department and and so we think of course this is the most important thing but I I mean but as a person who's practicing like this is the most important like his fears are like the most essential thing also and so I think it's also understanding the context of where you know that place in which is your your community you can't say like the hospital it is unless people are medical health or health professionals this is some Community work our spiritual Community is like very essential for our very existential important thing in our lives is the center of our lives so
 say like a spiritual bypass it's not exactly it can be can be helpful to me on phone it's just
text that it's used but somebody says you're not your body and you know you're you know you're you're bleeding and now you're not your body well he should go to the doctor in a lake. I'll be expecting a devoted you would wear the dress they're bleeding body using modern techniques similar mental health issues they could apply modern techniques of for mental health
 yeah I'm okay you know just a bit maybe 22
 to focus even little bit more tightly on this question you know they're there are text Patty text that describe you know what it means to surrender to God to give yourself fully to garden and those include same as I seen
that is your only shelter and got it you don't like this kind of they speaking in a language it's that is a very intentionally exclusive I don't depend on anyone but you your God I see their Altima and everything else is fallible but you you know who so coming from from that end as about to practitioner how do you view modern forms of therapy in in the field of Mental Health
 yeah I think it's an important question because
 I think there's
 been a lot of maybe misapplication of that term surrender to mean that we can't take guidance or expertise from
 people who dedicate their lives and an are quiet surrendered themselves to helping in certain areas you know and I think that maybe maybe the fork on the road that we've come to historically
I may be cooler this is also been your experience is the need for complementary training where someone has a level of expertise that that address is certain material skills or material areas of knowledge but they need to be complemented by spiritual culture because otherwise it it's actually incomplete not the spiritual cultures and completes for Spiritual things but it isn't complete for medical things I don't think that because you're a spiritualist you're an expert in dental care and no matter how much surrender you have for Krishna it doesn't make you any more expert in dentistry for example I'm pretty sure I should probably ask my sister went to devoti yeah and so that's the question right this this devoted put forth a question to you I hadn't just rub my crystal on it and I don't I also don't think that that's maybe what
 devotees are such a
thanks but I think that there is this you know this concept of funeral what kind of buccleuch was saying is we're not the body and so that she doesn't need to be our focus and we need to do the minimum required to basically survive and all of our other energy should be put to to spiritual life and and if you see it kind of like a car that's like driving cross-country you know like you can be a driver
 and have that realization of like I'm not this car I'm not the car I'm going cross-country in the car I know what my destination supposed to be I'm going to drive it I need to be driven properly but I'm definitely not this car but you can enter that domain of like so I'm not going to get an oil change I'm not going to rotate my tires if I get a flat I'm not going to fix it I'm not going to try and fill up on gas I'm going to put the minimum gas necessary to get me from Florida to California but what's going to happen I'm going to destroy my car and then what's going to happen is I'm going to have to get another car so I now have your sweetie you know
I might know where the destination is I might have the map to get there I might have all the right reasons to get there I know that I'm not the car but if I don't take care of the car and then includes the mind for us right that the body includes the mind-body complex and if they're more intertwined as we know now that we've ever understood it to be even though ancient science is always knew they were intertwined will have to take a new car we have to take an Uber to complete the mission right if we're not taking care of the vessel that's supposed to get us from A to B so I think that we are not this body doesn't mean we're not responsible for this body we're not the mind doesn't mean we're not responsible for the month so what's responsible care and I think that that's kind of what is devotee who wrote these questions is kind of alluding to which is as a spiritualist how are you responsible for the care of your mind especially because we're leaving Community maybe if I was just a yogi living in the Himalayas and I was in a cave and the way that I behaved or who I was or how I know
people didn't affect anybody
 that's one way to do it but that's not even our past that's not even a prescribed met since we're supposed to be interacting with people so perhaps in my surrender I could ostensibly and I would are you this but I would have spent it would be able to stay in my bubble of spiritual practice and be in that state of surrender such that it may be didn't disturb my spiritual practice I wonder if there's an asterisk on that for me but but I'm affecting other people I practice affecting other people and so if my behavior the way that I act or the way that I show up in the world because of some scar as because of trauma whatever is impacting my relationships then am I harming or hindering or slowing down the process of other people being able to share in the spiritual practice you know because because hurt people hurt people so just because I maybe have a way of coping with the way that I've been hurt it doesn't mean that I'm not transmitting that also
listen to movie Elsa transmitting spiritual ways in which I think could be massively confusing you know I assume struggle with their mental health their entire lives even even after seeking many different Therapies
 and it doesn't it doesn't that fact doesn't mean that their life can be a very valuable and Progressive and successful life even particularly if there is an element of understanding that's my mind and I'm me and I'm observing that mind and I have to carry that weight just as it a person with a physical malady what had you know why do you know what I'm going to live for the rest of my life and I'm going to deal with that and you know I am going to be moving slower than other people physically but it doesn't mean that my that my life's a failure now and simile someone may struggle with a certain mental health issue
they try to dress them anyways I still struggle with it it doesn't mean that my life hasn't been a success I think from a purely materialistic point of view it might feel that way because I never was able to shake this thing that's affecting my happiness but for devotie that's like really trying to call the vet a deeper spiritual realization not only you can like not be in the ones may not see that this life wasn't the one could say that this one could achieve the very gold of life even struggling with that with that burden. But I wanted to know when when the topic came up I merely thought of one verse that I want to share with the two of you and and I thought there might have been a clue in this first and maybe even a clue for us here and this is this is from the 4th cancer the bog the time
 chapter 30 text 35 this is the potatoes these 10
great young Yogi's
 who are the went out into the universe who were preparing themselves to become like a political leaders rulers in a sense but they're preparing themselves through meditation and then eventually had a vision of Lord Vishnu when they begin to say these prayers
 and they were granted their offered any benediction they want this is a common theme in Bobby time where the devotee after after prolonged meditation or service has audience with Lord Vishnu and and they're offered whatever benediction what would you like I'll give it to you and and Bob time consistently they respond by not asking for anything material but but but they're purely selfless devotional request
 and the request of the potatoes was all we want is to always be in the association of your devotees 3rd Edition that's that's our only desire
so they say in this text for 30 35 whenever pure topics of the transcendental world or discussed the members of the audience forget all kinds of material hankerings at least for the time being not only that but they are no longer envious of one another nor do they suffer from anxiety or fear okay so right there seems to be an indication that hey you just need to absorb yourself in Reading Baba Tom And discussing it and hearing these past times and so on and they will relieve you of all anxiety and fear your mental health disorder will be solved purely by that
 but as I looked at I want it to look more carefully at this because there is that kind of caveat here that's mentioned
 and it says at least for the time being
 right whenever pure topics of the transcendental world to discuss the members of the audience
get all kinds of material hankerings at least for the time being
 not only that but they are no longer envious of one another nor did they suffer from anxiety and fear and I and I looked at the Sanskrit and that at least for the time being that's not there in the Sanskrit like Prop Hunt inserted that in there. That was very interesting you know and and I looked at Jiva goswami commentary on this Earth
 and he says the highest sudden and Sadia of all have been shown so he's saying. The highest practice and high school love that practice have been shown here the high in other words bhakti practiced as perfection in the end in the chieftain of the goal is being highlighted in these vs. his that is shown in 3 verses 23 vs proceeding this first all hankering cease since the topics produced the highest attainment
 and this one is without enemies those enemies being anxiety
beer xcetera so it seems the pro-pot he included this little phrase at least for the time being we come together we practice bought that together we took your time together we re Baba time together and we feel a freedom a freedom from anxiety and feeling of Freedom From Fear of freedom freedom from mental anguish perhaps but it's transient you know hit it that that feeling may we may experience profoundly is practicing devotees and then we may wake up the next morning and be right in the same exact place of of mental struggle where we were before
 so in the practice that's the case that we taste something we we get some relief but it's only in the Perfection it's only wants to go has been achieved at the highest attainment has been achieved necessarily that we might
Harley conquer all the enemies are all the types of suffering that we have
 and so there's a like a a prescription for relief from all suffering that's bhakti its gut is it will relieve you of all mental suffering and all that when you've completed the practice you'll be entirely free and you might even feel that for some time as you practice but until you achieve that goal that that the issues may continue to to be present and then the question becomes what are the obstacles in the practice
 and those obstacles may have to do with our mental health like another words if my mental health issues prevent me from
 practicing body with full absorption
 then let me deal with that mental health issue in whatever way is most effective
 and that's not a lack of faith that is an Act of Faith
I just like I have so much faith that absorbing myself in the practice is about to your the solution that I'm determined to remove whatever obstacle it stands in the way of that and if it's a mental health issue then I'll deal with it then then I'll proach whatever solution I can so that I can practice this more deeply is that it is is that in your own I know Dona I'm pretty certain that often your your clients are practicing body Yogi's that they seek your help and I'm not sure if that's so much the case with with cool approval or 4 is fine but certainly their spiritual practitioner is often a different ways is that would that model kind of
 makes sense in your own experience
 my mom always told me to pull up
 yeah yeah I think that was something that I've been thinking about it as we were talking that
in our end also is
 I'll even meet you know there are in our practice this is like the continuing this is the thing of our life time to practice and and there are yeah there will be aspects of
 little anxiety or depression that the come and and I think sometimes
 when people come to see me it's they are dealing with 30 there are usually speak coming to because they're coming from a religious tradition and they want to speak to someone who understands some of these things is the biggest are the dealing and then to speak with it within religion of religious context because I think it's they wants and me also if I want to speak with somebody to not really just be there off of the strap that were on that we want we want to keep in mind that we're on this path of bhakti or this path of devotion
and I am feeling this this disconnectedness or I'm I'm feeling hurt from something and I or I'm feeling grief from something and I I want to know if I want to understand the context that I can continue on my path and for sometime in some cases with a path can be hurtful then that's also a discussion to have with people but it requires you know
 that space for a person to speak to dress those those issues with community
 thank you get done you in your own savea and your own service and is filled with people who are practicing and then other people who maybe don't identify that way but but certainly have some sort of spiritual principles guiding their life
what's a and I do find the
 to not address that spiritual element means to kind of take the whole thing out of context especially for these people because there's the why like why am I getting better why does Depression happen in the first place why am I struggling with anxiety and I think that you know when you read like profiles purports and I kind of think he's getting to the root of the route of the route because he has no time to waste he's trying to give you what no one else can give you someone else in the field might be able to give you well it's because he experiences trauma or because you have this chemical imbalance or because he know whatever but he's giving you something no one else can give you and it gives the ultimate context and I think that that is super valuable because
 you know there's that there's the that they call in like a little T traumas like the traumas that happened in day-to-day life that is sort of unavoidable and and kind of like her cousin grade us and we all kind of respond differently to them and then there's a big Tea Tree on my switcher like this
what kind of some scars are not organized and intentional they just happen naturally no deaths separations tragedies natural disasters that kind of stuff and there's a limit to
 the comfort and care that someone can receive if you don't address that spiritual element when those big T traumas come along right the big questions but big y's is happening who can I reach to for how quiet you know all those things I think that that's what gets addressed and so I think that you know when you're saying yeah you know you can be doing these practices and for a second head like a glimpse of the relief that you could feel if you were fully surrendered
 kind of permanently right if you were always in that state you could feel some of this but I I think that that the contrast to that is when the rug is kind of pulled out from under you and there's nothing also you feel that also
chill out there's like the positive experiences for a child and also the negative negative in the sense of something has been withdrawn now material life is not able to provide for you now there are no material answers for why the suffering is taking place and and so that's spiritual thing needs to be there too I think that there's like a healthy acknowledgement of the limitations of material resources also that can be a part of the conversation and so I think that it has to be both I think you need to be able to contact spiritual practices that give you the relief and they experience of what this could be permanently and then also the experience of kind of feeling like okay these tools in these resources they help but where my channeling into what's the ultimate goal because this alone is not going to be able to sustain me and I think that you know kind of like a clue as saying that interdisciplinary team of people who have different angles on this allow four to eight actually knowledge is a complexity of our human experience we don't just have a mental-health thing that needs to be addressed in a mental health way and spiritual needs a need to be addressed in a spiritually
it's all kind of wrapped up together and I actually found a quote from one of those proposed for ports in the bar with some cuz it's the vote he was also asking like what what does probuds say about this and I do a lot of things that all kind of resonate with this one quote that I found this is from Sherman Bobcat I'm 15 22 this is an appropriate because when advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord the whole process becomes absolute the personality of godhood and his transcendental name fayme Glory Etc are all non different from him there for all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of art science philosophy physics chemistry psychology and all other branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord
if my life isn't even if my face is such
 that that I've come to the conclusion that my very purpose is to uncover my love of Krishna and everything I do Weatherby my occupation my my my role in my family my role in my Society all of these things I see in relation to that
 atera primary goal in my life
 then then then my entire life that then then then that's it that's a manifestation of complete face right light full surrender and so here it is very interesting the proper use that that okay if I'm approaching a psychological therapy of modern site the uniform of psychological therapy
 if I'm doing it aligned with that purpose why why am I seeking to stay
because it's because there's an obstacle that preventing my full service my full absorption my full meditation that psychological so the reason I'm seeking that is not because I've lost faith in the practice is because because I have so much faith in the practice
 that I want to do all that I can to be able to practice it better and probably right there in his senses validating that with that statement was a very interesting when you know a lot of the seems to me that maybe the essence behind this question has to do with
 do are we prone as devotees to reach out to questionable practices are questionable ideas
 to solve problems that there are clearly clear-cut solutions to that that that that we were consciously or unconsciously avoiding
 and it occurs to me that
do the do the do the materialist looks at the solutions of of the tradition that the person of tradition as naive
 and you know like when we need to tone your body and they're looking at SRI chaitanya and he's in his devotion Lexi's those devotional ecstasies appear to others as a mental health disorder right like you is wrong as he's actually convulsing and end in so and you know an extreme devotional ecstasies and people are coming up with all kind of solutions you know he's haunted by ghosts he needs an exorcist oh you know who is he's got an imbalance of The Prana you know it in his body you need to you know the solution to this is rubbing oil you know how his body he needs the daily Avianca and and so they look at those things as naive although there is there a lot can be said for those things you know
and the traditionalist looks at the Modern things as
 misdirected in and potentially destructive you know it and it's a fact that you know so much of the you know people are being drugged like crazy nowadays nowadays and there's all kind of side effects and has all kinds of problems that developed through that and at the same time there's a lot of a lot of people are being helped and finding solutions to Modern methods that on both ends there's quackery on both ends there's a fence can fall short in their application and at the same time both also do provides practical answers
 and that's why I kind of like your idea and it's something that you both invited so well to to your two people that I've known for many years that are very serious
depressed spotty and in very engaged in it and at the same time
 bouncing that are you entering your field your your modern filled with that and providing you use to turn down the I forget what it was but kind of like a call your number what I was
 I'm sorry I'm never going to unmute you and I and I buy some approaches that we can I suppose as as practitioners of these fields of therapy that you both operate in that you find a range of people and just that there's a you know a range of of how
 these techniques should be applied some people need more of this and some people may be need more of that or less of this or less
but it does seem like there's a it's a healthy idea to say that these can work together for the one at NS as for the devotees for the buck to Yogi's for those with his faith that that combined I'm sorry that these processes can be seen as complementary and always within the context of
 with that that one goal of the Diwali that one that that one faithful golden Vale that whatever I do that all my that my body my words my mind that they all be offered entirely to God that's that's my goal that's my purpose and that's my purpose in seeking these kind of therapies I thank you both so much we run out of time it's it is such a big topic but I think I am hopeful that we got to the
