to the chant a mantra with enthusiasm right now to break out of this little bit of Hayes that you're in for about the blind Lila on the way down
 don't think it's a good good drive but it just worried out it was a great ride. So you got your gnome are a little better told her that she's like a criminal speeder she was barely speeding because I just had a quota you could tell she was going to like 14 miles above Sergeant cards get-out-of-jail-free cards I called them works every time you looked at it was like you're getting a ticket it was not having it okay I told I told her all about the heart
scene and how we got at the Christian at like more details and I ever told her the hardcore scene how Christian of influence got envelope influenced into that hardcore seeing how it the origins of it all the colorful characters in that scene you know you know there's various
 thugs
 I guess you could call it thugs that were inspired by Krishna Krishna song attract if you can Inspire someone who's very saintly but is not has no connection to God working Inspire some type of criminals I remember one time going to my apartment on the Lower East Side back on the Lower East Side was a real dangerous place and I lived with like 14 people all different types of crazy people I live in this apartment and this big sort of
 gang member came out of the apartment I don't know what he was doing there he didn't live there but he was sorted into Krishna but that really I was just bored to spiritual things
Portland I-5 here it was going to tell you her name is the full moon if you've noticed in the skies are beautiful moon today and he looked at me and he goes
 are you going to court like I said in like a real harsh voice are you going to be in today I was like I don't know what that is he goes on his appearance
 and I was like oh no and I didn't know and he goes and he looked at me or his finger to goes its going to be auspicious of one sort of like gang members use like a very beautiful Victorian British words like auspicious so that was that was that was the first time I've ever heard of core pretty and I did not go that year
that would have been like 1987 or Neymar gaura purnima from Calcutta to
 are you sure it's not just that's the Sanskrit way to say I supposed to like bengalis were like they were correcting me you know
 or pretty much
 Spokane Valley way to say it what size she is shastri she's on the Shelf she'll know you like no I do know I'm just saying there's different Lives Many many languages that use the Arts in sand and definitely has a long a
 is it a long at the end of Reagan.
for the night I think it is I don't think of that but I think it is in India tube goes to sleep that's why sometimes I call you cuz stupid but I'm telling you you brought us to buy your name is Dubai so I wasn't doubting it I was in town again I was just saying it's where name and I think there are languages that do called for him I don't know that's why I was going to ask go to see I just realized you are just a grump is today right you know what is this digging in the in the Florida beaches
 and finding a beautiful Treasure Chest like a beautiful ornate Treasure Chest why would you be digging in the first place why do you cuz people did on beaches
Daytona Beach beautiful golden ornate Treasure Chest but there's no key to get in when people get interested in everything everything metaphysical things spiritual things reincarnation in Indian art Indian dance astrology palmistry you know gemstones all these things like how do you get in
 cuz each one each one of those things I mentioned is like an ornate feature on the chest
 but how do you get inside the treasure chest let me tell you my friends the key is Sri chaitanya mahaprabhu that is the key that opens up at Treasure Chest and it ties all those very interesting
subjects it ties them all together and demonstrates their purpose and largely Tanya sitting in that chest no don't you tell me is the key to do that now. He only at Treasure Chest opens up his the bottom of tub the stream of Donald Trump's inside light on down the bog with time and it how special is that how it how how about what time is the key the key
 key to understanding all the other literature well I think Lord she turns the key to understand the Baga Tom check this one out put the key in you open up another key inside there
 in the Bible times in there and then you get back here then you open up your house Bob is okay how about this one
 right now I know what
tell you know radha-krishna but if you know Lord say Tonya but if you know then you will know radhakrishna at me it's real that's the real one okay let's let's speak a little bit about who you is you know okay let's just map it out a bit the thing is even amongst you know Krishna
 if we go to Schulenburg, it lists all the different avatars of Krishna
 and then it says about 8th junk Saca La Panza Christmas to vagabonds for young Christian is is the source of all of these avatars they're all coming from that sweet baby Christian at very personal
 most personal
 manifestation form right at the end that form of Krishna it's he's showing everything this is the whole me write the different avatars he may not be revealing his whole self
but you should tell him it's it's it's it's his fault it's like knowing that just like a person you know they may not reveal their whole personality in the workplace or under different circumstances in different settings but when you get them at home they're in the backyard. You know you got the whole person you know they they reveal their whole Krishna in Galaga for David he Reveals His whole personality and in all the different unique ways that you can be loved his call tequila rest and recover more tea and that form and Morty it it it it done within that form he can he can respond and in reciprocate with all different dresses all different moods of of love and devotion
 so that is the source of all the avatars but then he take he comes into this round because you somehow weave weave
we've wanted to try to
 experience what it's like to be him in some way and in reality we can't support that we're we're we're we don't have that ability but we're able to enter into this virtual reality of this world the material but he comes into that realm he maintains a real me some free crates it maintains it supports it and enters into it in so many different ways to for different reasons in different purposes in so these different avatars have different purposes and just different categories of avatars like we could start by saying there's the pro shop at ours and that's for the creation in the maintenance of the material world rather than those Pro Shops are the three different forms of Lord Vishnu beginning with mahavishnu is called there's a within the limited spiritual Sky you can picture like a in a calculable e large bubble and
she was lying down and you know floating in the water that and it said that from his will has water in it just going to mention that and within that bubble he's lying in from the pores of the skin as he breathes unlimited more bubbles come out in each one of those is a universe it's like a bubble machine is going on here and so each one of those is the universe right hard to believe isn't it but why not sure what do I know right and this is also is helping us this is the zoom division is helping us understand in one sense
 it's his counterbalance in once
we are Eternal we are forever we are in that sense unlimited we are made of indestructible spiritual energy that has no beginning and no end and at the same time currently our situation is weirdest tiny tiny tiny who's a lifetime is just the tiniest tiniest tiniest little speck and we're considering all this to be so important and so significant we get so upset about the smallest little thing I do not understand just how tiny are proud I'm sure there are like living entities dying when I inhale too and like I don't know the sign yourself or like the deeper deeper deeper deeper down we don't even know where the the bottom of it but this what you're explaining sure the top of it not the exhales and the in-house of Lord Vishnu are creating an
destroying universes with exhale they go out on the in here they come in the entire lifetime of burmaa which is practically inconceivable for us is just one brats and I think I'm so important and so and then and then he then he enters into each one of those universes
 in the second Pro Shop at our garbage out trying to manifest his lineup. There's water in this bubble to
 every bubble has water in it and from his Naval grows elotes in Amazon that Lotus appears the meditation and Krishna he enters is hard and in shares with him all that he needs
no
 so that in a mood of devotion
 he can engineer that entire universe. All the different species of Life created all the different planets cradle at all everything in this particular promise I even aware of all the other brahmas growing out of beans are there motorcycles in the other bubbles, is the creator of every living entity within that universe and therefore his what a powerful position I have and that's why we see it sometimes even Lord vermaak and fall into illusion because he's got like that he's got the best game ever he's like the original being powerful you think about what a big shot and then the incident now he's created all these different species and all these different living entities the third Pro shops that are the third form of Lord Vishnu it enters the heart of every living being an evil within every atom of the internet Papa
 yeah now so
these aren't exactly bubbles but I guess atoms are like bubbles bubble come up with a better take away in the butt but so now he's he spread his awareness and in every nook and cranny and you know he's like the son spreads its Rays he spread his awareness throughout this universe it throughout every Universe throughout every living body he's this is what it means to be Vishnu right it means to provide his weirdest is providing everything so that so in order for this world to work for us we need we need these purusha avatars to manifest in this way into helping us to this world but then you know within that vast expanse of time one day of her Mama that this is the life of this universe there are fourteen different
Marvin Taurus another type of Avatar that is that is empowered to kind of government different periods of time and we can read about some of those who want to be read by the time the different monitors at the different ages and so on by the way this thing goes very deep if some of your like this is too complicated just can we have like God and the Son of God in the mother of God can we keep this simple simple if you want you can say you don't love God with all your heart and soul even say that love Krishna tharangam Krishna you can say that but it's like opening up a watch you can either just tell the time or you can like open it up and see how that Watch Works special it is if you don't open it open it up take a look around you don't have to live there like some people are really like scientifically minded may live in this stuff like that and then there's a saboteur in this house that I don't have to look at open it up a little
now there's another type of Avatar called Laguna Avatar which means that this world again if we we spoke this last week or some like that right like if you there's these different like a video screen and saying that I think it's RGB color red green blue like there's little pixels different three different colors but those three different colors in different combinations they create all the different shades that we see on the video screen are you interesting different energies that this entire material realm is made of
 and they Blended different ways to create all the different varieties but they have different influences right there's the motive goodness the motor passion the motive in your eyes and there's an avatar that governs each one of these becomes an empowered Avatar sometimes Christina takes the role of her mom self sometimes he empowers another living in the news to do it but you have your mama if you could say in charge
Rogers you have Shiva in charge of Thomas any of this to himself in charge of a septic wound and so we're not going to go into too much about this there's also Lila avatars Christa, said he plays in a particular way I usually is battling someone or doing something heroic you know and there's a whole list of ugly labs are Reese's Pieces Of Fish she comes as a tortoise comes as Lord ROM becomes as long as she knew Dave becomes his momma today becomes variety of you comes in all these different formerly Hunters Creek to himself as Alibaba Target performs Lila
 add an internet Lila there's so much for us to be to learn from but also to be attracted to or I like we need to see the Magnificent beautiful wonder is Lila's of Christian and all the different ways that they manifest and then there's also another kind of guitar called shuck your veitia batara
which means it's not exactly Christian but it's Christmas Power working through a living being the four Kumar's a call to shut your face I was in Naruto
 remind self we read about 32 in the in the Bob with Tom partial Ramen about time we even here obviously of himself is an empowered incarnation
 and it's Even Stevens said like there's a category of Chuck TV show b r called big booty which means like the different Dave us that they're they're kind of like reflections of the Lord's power so you have Indra and hug me and nehru Andre hospitality and kartik a.m. bring you these different kind of they have the Lord's power working through them in there cuz they kind of fit under this subcategory of a subcategory Bobbitt ours then you have something in this is part of world war cheat on you comes in there's the yoga Avatar it means that for every each of the four
seasons of the universe is an avatar of Vishnu appears that reveals that you could Dharma that reveals that this is how we practice spirituality in this age
 and dumb in this age SRI chaitanya is that you got out of the car for the age of Kali and he teaches how we practice spiritual approach a l sunk your time at that in this age yoga Dharma is how do you know I'm sunk your time it's not your go-ahead to use our avatars are coming the different colors is incorrect yes is white red black and yellow I knew he would be yellow or gold
 yes tell me what to say
 Green's one of them to then again I know that's the same Patrick's Day
white sugar is Red Rock. Krishna Blackish
 and yellow turn is much more than a yoga Avatar
 and that's where we want to get this bring this conversation and this is the very esoteric theological idea that's Express it's like your hearts into and now we're going to like throw this out yet yes we are Morehead Idaho
 this this theological understand is chemicals in your mind is kind of
 wow like this is so beautiful and sweet and I I just can't even
conceive of it you know but here's the idea that all of this Vedic literature as we say many times on the show it's important for us to to understand reality is important for us to become free of all of our sufferings in life to let go of all attachments and experience our own spiritual nature that's also important but when you get to the bar with Tom would be us finally reveals with Iran great detail is that all of that becoming free of the influence of the material energy it's full the blossoming of its full value is found in love it's found in Divine love that this Divine love is the highest price when all of this yoga salt only meant to bring us there and we read about that Divine Love In The Bob & Tom and we read about the most beautiful and intimate Divine love in the temp cancel the Box on Denver and Abba write it in the end of that place where Christian Reveals His hole
 is his whole being his whole heart
do people say Christian is a god of love my people speak about that and maybe often when like people are saying that
 the saying a kind of like in a bit of a kitchen knife on the way oh yes he plays with the gopis and eat you know people that don't really understand all that. But they don't really understand the significance of it all is she always playful and he's beautiful that's sweet is the god of love but really you know if we could understand that meaning that it becomes March a much deeper theological concept that that all powerful being who was just a spark of his energy
 write create unlimited universes from the pores of his body
 right and and end in does other unlimited things that even though he's so powerful and so unlimited omniscient excetera all the stuff that we considered that when we think of God was great all
he said he his only interest is he has no interest in power he has no interest in creation has no interest in judging
 his only interest is in Love Therefore
 he he he creates all these different he expands is all these different avatars or empowers he's different beings to take care of the material realm because he's just interested in love and when he comes into this material world as Krishna
 he brings his realm of love with him and he just shows people what that love looks like and that's what we read about in the 10th cancer
 he's so captivated by love and nothing else
 the Heat and becomes controlled by it right when one has love for Krishna
 they can control God that most powerful of all forces that's how powerful but dear Divine love is so with that brief
background now let's look at Krishna
 not the very Pinnacle of either the not only the Bob the time not only All The Vedic literature not only the box I'm not only the 10th can to the bottom of town but then the climax of the 10 to the bog time is there in the Russell Leela Krishna dances with a gold piece right and and we've spoken about how they give up everything they run out of their homes when they hear Christian playing the flute and they come running to give everything a fatty zzizim you should go back to your homes and your Dharma since your duties into family life and home life in the, you know it like we have no interest in all of the things of this world we just want to serve you with love please accept us Tears in their eyes
 and Krishna accepts them in the dance and I dance is the most exceptional beautiful perfect mind-blowing manifestation of love being expressed in the most beautiful artistic way even the demigods are like
flying above it showering flowers down I'm just saying what is this that we're witnessing it's just inconceivable the beauty the death of this love
 and at the end of that dance
 Crystal feels like
 I wish the gopis they've given me their hearts they've given me the full of right
 I wish I could reciprocate and give them something back
 but he realizes that the love that they have for me and what they're feeling in their hearts
 that there's nothing that exist that can compete with that they've got they've already got
 the highest thing there is to have
 so he says to them I wish I could reciprocate with all that you give me
 but all I can do is say please be happy with the Divine love that you have in your heart cuz
Stigmata have
 and in that realization he realizes they have something that I don't have
 they've got love for God in their heart which is such an exceptional experience that I'm not capable of feeling because I'm God I'm the object that look
 I wonder what it feels like to have that Prima the Rada has for me what would it be like to feel that cuz I can see if her ecstasy is greater than mine or Ecstasy of loving the Divine source of all being is more powerful even than being loved
 what does it feel like to feel that in the heart he becomes captivated by this idea
 and the only way that he can experience it
 is my coming
 as a devotee of himself following in the Footsteps in the mood with the complexion of Shima
Ronnie and therefore he comes in Shreveport on Youree that's what street it's on use your blow in some mines right now I can give a very practical example here's a most practical example
 when in a we would play a big show our band play Big Show
 any travel there you can the van of the bus go there's backstage and support that you some short excited sort of fun you going to put on a poor man's a lot of people showing up and there's like a buzz in the air and the band takes the stage and everybody and you know you put on a quote performance or a you sing your songs etcetera and it's fun and it's joyful is really good
 but the people in the audience they are enjoying it more and I've even said that to myself while singing on stage I was like they are enjoying this more than I'm enjoying this they've actually been like meditating all day long I'm going to get to go to this concert and we're going to get to go to you know I'm going to I'm going to spend this whole
Levi's near enter the bands coming to town this week I'm going to spend all week listening to their their songs you know I touch their foot through my hand pretty high five me it's like
 to me to high-five. It's nice it's a nice gesture but imagine if you're a fan and you know Janis Joplin Jimi Hendrix piano Taylor Swift they just come up to you in high five you when I was young I was high five by Annabelle from Bow Wow and I was like she must have felt like you know what it's cool people think I'm cool I'm going to high-five this kid I thought like oh my God I'm going to tell people about the store forever and sure enough I still am so my point is like there's so much love in the devoted those who are devoted they are they have a different if not I hire taste in the person who was actually at the center
probably use example of a mother with a child with a baby like a new mother has her baby in her hands the babies feeling the love of the mother and that feels wonderful but the mother's heart is just melting like and saying you know it's a Christmas looking around and say like that I need to eat, to shoot your 22 experienced Riders love he experienced is it in kirtan he experiences a chanting the holy names he experiences in hearing about what time experience is it in hearing the The Poetry of the great Bucky poets Association of just a couple of I mean it said the rod is closest friends Lolita machaca also come with Street you Tanya
 as Ramadan to Ryan's and screwed download with Swami cuz who better can help him experience the mood of rod in the rod is his most intimate friends that's an interesting point of like to Tanya Lila is that you know in this
world I love trying to understand things of this world when we try to understand the celestial world and of this world whenever someone very important shows up rarely do they do something alone there are you bringing the Entourage they bring an Entourage and sewing Street a Tanya ma purple comes the demigods are ordered by brahmaji to take birth in in the dynasty Associates, and then and then sure enough when she Tanya Pearce same thing all these associates from Christian is Lila start to appear indifferent Brahmin households all around then also the demigods who are big fan they're like the big fan of the fans come as well you know when he was little the demigods wanted to have darshan so there they would either
 just manifest
cuz they can do this as just ordinary people just sort of like walk around the village and being on the house but they were actually there were not from the village they're actually higher beings if not alien some people call them and just pier in just to have dark shuttler to Tania or sometimes they would come in an invisible form and it would just appear almost like you know did you ever have like like what you feel like a shadow came by so they would appear at like that like hovering around the room in like a nun manifest form and then when people with and especially in cultures like that that actually believed in spirits and ghosts and stuff like that it would think there's a ghost in here trying to pack my child a tail fishing his name
 exactly the Democrats you also wanted to come to take part in the Lila have the darshan of the Lila everybody was attracted cuz in the spiritual world everybody
attracted to Krishna and in this world everybody's attracted to Krishna even higher beings and so so then now you have to shoot a tiny this is Christian himself it's not even exactly an avatar is Krishna is not anyting like
 the other avatars like Vishnu that's just like a and it's it's it's Christian but it's just showing a part of himself but it shoots a Tanya that is Christian himself with a different complexion
 but his whole fixation is whole internal fixation is experiencing that love of rotted mahbob the deepest
 purest most overwhelming powerful love it that exists Robin love he's experiencing now that's his internal experience he's come for two reasons though it said right he has his internal experience of Crema but it said that when you take the Prema
 when is
when when do the voting has love for God in their heart and is focused on Krishna we call it Prima and that same feeling of love when it's when it's playing a Christmas called Prima bonus when it's pointed at the the living entities of the squirrels
 it's it it manifests is compassion
 write the Same Love turn the other way
 is is overwhelming compassion being because he's feeling the most intense love Prima
 that when he turns that same intense love it becomes the most intense compassion becomes the deepest most powerful most overwhelming most almost all logical Beyond reasonable Mercy you know is manifesting that form should you Tanya so in this age of Kali at the age where Mercy is most needed the age where people are confused and quarreling constantly and Disturbed with Disturbed minds and suffering so intensely he's
giving compassion like crazy very very special
 manifestation and very very special opportunity because he's saying I'm just going to do the most precious thing this diprima in the heart is more precious than then life on the Heavenly planets and on the higher plan is far more precious far more precious than the experience of Liberation into the rummage o t you know it's a to the treasure that they say is I have to I can't just wait around to find people that are qualified for it people suffered I'm going to give it I'm just going to give it out I'm going to get everybody to help me and that's what should you turn your father's are doing is like take this Prima Just chant his name even if even if you have no qualification even if you aren't some great Yogi even if you can't perform austerity even if you're incapable of Performing precise ritual all the
when things that were important all the all the other Vedic considerations I don't consider them at all I don't care he or just take it just take it you know get a reward I can do a good according to my INR yoga teacher I can't do a appropriate up dog am I still qualify to get it cuz scuba we're not qualified but he's giving it anyway even if I can't do an appropriate up dog and so answer this manifestation future tell me when you hear the book are we wanted to read some verses in these vs. they may sound too esoteric or to the clarifications is too high at over to get it we want to give this background
 did you search the end of when the Great sages won the great dammit the demigods themselves hold it this is beyond we are devoted to the Avatar of Vishnu this is way beyond that this is inconceivable Howie's, this merciful mood wow I thought I was lucky to be up here on the family plan is the people on earth
right now we're shooting Tanya. They're getting the greatest gift is way beyond what I've got there the fortunate ones the most unfortunate become the most fortunate by the grace of she should tell you so maybe we can read a little bit from sure the Pro Bowl turn on the side so I could talk or cheat on you know I think before we even get into that it's good to say that I think everybody especially looking at all the Zoomer face is right now people listening unzoom but people out there listening we've all been touched by this stuff or most of us wouldn't be here it's all affected us in a deep way to the point we were coming back on a regular basis some of you guys have radically shifted your life around to take more boxy into your life some people have given up things they were attached to some people that weren't serving them some people have radically change their behavior and their habits because there's something sweeter
 on the other side of that and
 you should understand that that was
given to you by Lorde chaitanya so that's how you can fully appreciate some appreciate some of these verses you know I was doing this to my kids the other day I was just like way to hear this person I read something from promoting on the core and my ten-year-old goes I don't get it. He's affected your life in some way you should have that appreciation for like okay I got that from Morty time to do it and it to me by Laura cheat on you I was just a simple story because
 it reminded me of is something very very
 and relatable which was there was a follower of Lord chaitanya
 who was completely desperate he was a well-to-do person named was gunga Dass
 and he
was he do this this was a time of fierce colonialism the time of large Italian in India where they could just you know
 the rulers of the time could just do anything to you and you'd be helpless and living in some type of police state and so one time he was getting attacked and his family was getting attacked and they were running his wife and his daughters and he was fearing they are going to kill me and you know brutally molester kill my children I don't know what to do you think I might just have to we don't even understand how hard are these situations cuz most of us have never been in such a horrible situations but this type of desperation makes you like I want I want my whole family died or something until he was running towards the ganga and he was praying if there would be a boat here I could get away but it was like the middle of the night
pursued fearing for his family's life you could imagine the terror within him and he was praying oh my Lord if please send a boat save my family what can I do it sure enough there was a boat there in the middle of the night and he got on that boat and he basically said that my life is yours if you could just save my family and then when he got on the boat he said to the boat I will give you anything please protect my family take me away from this place right now
 and so that happened it was sort of like we've all had sort of Miracles Little Miracles like that we say a prayer and something happens please help me out of the situation and something happens
 but he never told anybody about that and during the
 Maha prakash that's when Lord chaitanya I bet that the nocturnal this night League here times
 and he revealed himself as the Avatar otherwise
