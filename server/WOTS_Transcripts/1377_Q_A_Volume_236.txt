 that's my day off no right to walk around in circles rubbing your face with what do I do with my life and I'll be alright I'll be alright
 alright so let's start with the questions this is from
 we're allowed to read the name right Mikey Goldberg Goldberg
 I like when adults go with a child they like Mikey
 right rights to be Stephanie Stephanie and Josh pit for drumettes Stephanie moshpit will be at the picnic
a 70 mph be there at names. I called them but one day stuck with him okay Mikey Goldberg says hello I haven't recently got in the back seat and I feel very drawn to the teachings and the path I've been listening to the podcast daily for about a month after reading on some Monk elevator any home
 all right I'm smoking journey home I want to get copies of the bog of Tom and the Gita and I don't love reading online to people mainly read from database or other sites or are they the places are there places online to buy copies only handle this every book distributors like I'm over here getting ready where you know any local iskcon temple will have them but if you could just buy them on amazon.com to just Google bug of agita as it is
so you know or write me back what time BB&T like that of course the commentaries there's the ones we study in the read widely available before too long and we're going to kick into that I want to get out in front of it this year. You know when if one donates it's about with x
 oh yeah you know that the political I'll get you can get it right in front of it right now but some you're right out there if so could you if I didn't say you did everybody let's all it would let's all night mine was okay yeah you can find them there anyway he says this normal
what about what time he says one other question I have is I started to dive deeper into boxing and I have been feeling a lot more disconnected from friends and family yeah that's that is normal that happened I have become increasingly disengaged and I don't talk uninterested and at times disturbed by gossip AKA snobby want to go there is this normal I know this is a sign that I need to meet more and spend more time with like-minded people but how can I control my thoughts and emotions one spending time with the people I love and care about and not let it bother me
 oh that's a good one huh it seems like we all go through this phase often times and
tickets it's similar to when you say clean up your diet you clean up your diet then when people are eating around you're like well why would they be eating them and sometimes you get a little judgmental why are they eating better why why doesn't he understand this by eating this it's going to have this result and I don't want to go to that restaurant because they don't have anything I can eat
 when you start becoming really refined and who you want to become
 you realize I have a lot less in common
 with the masses of people even people that were very close to me sometimes I found cuz tuba that
 my only relationship with some people as friends
 what some things that I didn't want to be any more example you know in a teenage guy I'm just talking about sex and girlfriends and making fun of people that's what I did was $18 plus tax. Bill girls and make fun
other people sit on the stoop sit on the stoop and then you just make fun of everybody that walks by I wouldn't sit on the stoop but it was just sort of like that's what I would say just it's just horrible isn't it just cruel his parents money at somebody else's expense was like always a freakshow to wework part of the freaks are people said it to us people would be walking in like that they think they are walking around in that wear and that you know sometimes if you're really rude say something out loud
 back then when I say we make fun of them to their face
all right but the point is that's what we did and of course we talked about girlfriend sex look at her judging rating her body and stuff like that
 and then when I realized like that's not the type of person I want to be and I'm going to cut that language
 I'm not going to talk about girls like things I'm not going to talk about girls like like something to consume and write them according to their external body and I don't want to find fault with people and those were like sort of principles that I got into when I wanted to be in a spiritual path it I realized like some of my friends I had solutely nothing to talk about with absolutely nothing ready to come with you there were ready to come with me and then I felt weird and awkward and I I like them but all my likeness for them was based on something else but you know sometimes I
I think in a mature state of mine now I can say
 sometimes other people grow also you do sometimes you may not grow it just a different plants I have this one tree in my Orchard it's a East Coast persimmon and this thing is taken like 3 years to sort of kick in and develop a root system where the other one is blurry shaking their huge 20 ft tall or 15 ft tall and they're giving fruit this was taking its time and it's going to stablish itself in maybe a couple years from now so people are some people ready to go is to a certain place but it sometimes takes a year or decade or a lifetime or maybe never at all we seen that as well
 salt in retrospect I just want to like kind to everybody but I don't invite everybody in my life anymore and for me I had to make a conscious step away
from a circle of friends because
 it was too hard for me I was too attached into those two in the mix of all my friends and my people and I seen that I actually had to make a conscious effort to cut to cut and then reintegrate people into my life on my terms make sense either re-enter I'm going to reintegrate you into my life on my terms sound good or else I could just be otherwise I'm under there it on Christmas terms by this battle big bear has done it so much I mean Marys cement has the middle path you and me a couple extremists and what did you tell us because do I sound like an extremist
 no but I mean for me maybe because I was older when I got a
Krishna Consciousness I wasn't it just sort of make such a I didn't make such a big extreme cut her my friends and family but what I experienced was you know you can take a little distance because it's like you're not eating me you don't want to talk about the same things you don't want to drink anymore you know those sorts of things so it naturally created a little distance and at first I was like sort of had the same thing that might be Goldberg's going through or like like man talking this way like I'm just trying not to talk you know being disturbed by a lot of the speech but then like after some time and space I was like oh well I remember calling one of one of these people in particular that I'm thinking of I remember calling her on her birthday and I'll take what you doing today to celebrate your birthday and she's like oh I'm making lasagna and I was like oh for who and she's like all of this contractor guy who works for me too son got in a really bad car accident so I'm going to bring over a bunch of food for him and I was like
 she cooking for someone else
put the service on her birthday and I was like what a devoted like I was like such a naturally and so it's like after I took some space I was able to see like these sorts of people is like oh like wow you are such a chimera nice mare so balanced was there any meeting that lasagna no but that's the point right rather than see what was lacking you saw what was there
 I like that better it's good it may because we just found out what do you think I should maybe got into a two-year-old I think what he's saying like he's he asks he's feeling disconnected from family and friends
 and he's become increasingly disengagement idle talk uninterested and a x disturbed by gossip is this normal you know what if you're doing it right that's totally normal you should be feeling exactly that
if you feel exactly that but now the question is how do you respond to that feeling and you can yeah you can respond to it on the level of a neophyte like the beginner or you can respond to it like in the middle and high school respond to it as I like that the more evolved spiritualists and so in our practice the ideas we want to get off that neophyte level as quickly as possible because nobody likes a neophyte and it's nothing but suffering anyway the neophyte responses I'm better than these people I'm I'm better than these people you feel it and so you've come to the truth
 but you're still relating to it as a person that has not realized truth so you've accessed some kind of knowledge and understanding in life that they have not access yet but you haven't evolved through that knowledge yet so you're responding to it from a person that still has no spiritual depth and so the response
I'm better than that because I'm not engaged in that gossip and then when you were late on that level people don't like that nobody lies and even you won't like it in the long run you know that's why everyone hates religion because most religious people are neophytes they might Beyond a truth but the responding to it on that unrealized level so that just becomes office
 as being judgemental feeling Superior and you know any more ugly kind of manifestations of Tina gets violent or you know how oppressive so violent people do with their ideas of righteousness as we're right and they're even there either they're evil yeah you know what the phrase that goes with this cuz you want to be strict good be strict with yourself and be one hundred percent tolerant with everybody else
 no doubt
can input it but still I think his question goes deep or like maybe he's being tolerant
 but now the question is how can you relate with these people you know I think you said what you said let's go back here he said
 I know this I know this is a sign that I need to meet more and spend more time with like-minded people but how can I control my thoughts and emotions when spending time with the people I love and care about and not let it bother me and so I would say keep this idea in mind right that when you respond you you're onto something that what they're talking about has no value
 it's not uplifting them is not uplifting you you got that but you have to exist in that space with them and how where's your mind going to be when you in that space if it's thinking I hate you do you know if it's like that resentment in it and in your in your thoughts do you want
go beyond that and you want to think that the deeper spiritualist is seeing through their mental programming I just said you were saying a few minutes ago right everyone's a beautiful person underneath this person may or may not have underneath underneath yeah they may or may not have external beauty but you're seeing like on the mental level on on the level of their conversation and their thought their thoughts aren't engaged in a beautiful way and I don't like it
 okay but you know that underneath that too
 is that person that did the the soul the self that the does have that spiritual Beauty keep that in mind at all times that reality has to stay with you at all times and the more that you're acting on that the level of that vision
 the more that they're going to appreciate you not yet you know even if they don't get it it first though
feel that that you don't have any sense of judgmentalism in you
 it's a maybe it's not it's a tall order maybe it's not easy to do but that's what you're working for so that's just I'm just doing that one thing out there right
 don't don't don't don't root yourself down into that neophyte type of thinking which is like enjoying my Superior my spiritual superiority over this person it's it's it's almost like a an oxymoron or like some kind of contradiction in terms if you're on that level you really know where
 spiritual superiority t-shirt
 I saw you showed me yesterday.
 All right that was good one Mike Goldberg Micah Goldberg I got one from chitra Devi
a knitting Hirsch rubbing them scarves she's got quite a big problem scarf collection here at super-soul hitting the back of a tub into the skull you know what's great about winter here I get to where the shop and I'm scarves when you have an original copy of the original the Tri-Valley the first guy was I meant I must remember you were saying in the first episode she was knitting because she never did it before she always just sat there in class and then we start the podcast because we did it before the podcast are we start the podcast she started sitting there knitting and she wasn't like on a look this up look up look that up in a fix app adjust this
 and then I said I was and I will chastise her on the show and say Mary got to stop your knitting if you were soaked
concentrate with your knitting and it turns out she was knitting from me for my birthday all along or she faked it feel bad but I got a scarf out of it the nicest present I've ever got questions from the mind with its memories ingrained habits and preferences acquired skills and addictions is part of the material subtle body
 how come children who remember their past lives not only episode realize about yesterday score
because on the show just before that I shared something with you
 that I think it was on the show just before that that like even the Christian makes you experience he makes us all experienced certain things like in this kind of no getting around it so like even though I don't have children I have to experience some of the things that a parent experiences when they have children even ever at change that diaper on an airplane you've never been the screaming kid on public transportation but let me ask you a question have you ever like thought this is something great it will. I'll do it with my kids to love it I mean this is going to make them happy and I want to be so happy to share this with him and and I can't wait to see how excited they become like we always do that and then you then you take them
yeah yeah you know that feeling yeah did that took him to box seats at a Dodgers game Stadium gate baseball they're like this is it I was like Yep this is it this is the best of the worst you're right it is a boring game and that's what I went through yesterday right after I want I was going to give you this big juicy girl that's it here today did you see the thumbnail from test with your squirrel your kind of looking like a boring sorry about that it's easier to take my parents bought me a bicycle once in their child's bicycle
 and I wish you know
this is really important to the idea that we just can't get around certain things in life no matter how much we might try yeah you know if you don't have children you got to go through that stuff thank you Robin I said thank you for that cold callous way that he dealt with me sorry man
 I'll let you ride bikes with Tyrone how about that remember their past lives not only have memories but also offered show habit skills addictive behaviors like asking to drink liquor or four cigarettes from the refuse a shot of that has reference from Ian Stevenson's children remember previous live audio request
art of a subtle body travel with The Swordsman X body
 does at least part of the subtle body travel with the soul to the next body are those informations transferred to the Soul at time of death is that what since cars are and what are the scriptural evidence or explanation for how this happens good question
 do you think I'm not I'm researching something right now but I'm not going to tell both of you do that before this year I jumped at me I just had some inspiration okay boss, I want to hear what the behavioral tendency or karmic imprint influences the present behavior of a purse
it's a technical term in Indian philosophy particular yoga a Buddhist use it as well so it's like leaves are they different than slipping my mind right now okay anyway
 anyway you have to settle body travels with a soul and sometimes we were saying yesterday there's some trauma
 the kid can remember what happened in the last life and there's lots of cases like this doctor in Stevenson University of Virginia came up with a lot of the stuff I gave some links for a websites that we trust I trust and I trust I trust and then the Air Force was my personal experiences then Bobby Marchand he's doing Retreat for this weekend has some crazies personal stories to with her kid she shared some of them on the show and remember that you don't ever get her kid is like her old boyfriend or friend or something on it and she mentioned all these things about how he died
and then once the child looked at Bobby and said hi Bobby Bobby world's two or three was like I mean you know she just called her mom or Mama and you know she can call her by her name so for her to say hi Bobby all of a sudden it was at just the right time right there's something inside like member that time I fell down the stairs and hit my head and everything went black
 and then she said she didn't remember that Bobby so they get their subtle bodies come with them they get there
I say it's a practice what you have today if your excel at something it's a practice and people you know people get good at Art because they practice people get good at lifting weights in a practice it but sometimes you find children excel at things why cuz this whole life is a practice we are practicing our subtle body strengthening our intelligence or strengthening our creativity by practicing it or you can also strengthen your addictive behavior your sarcastic and rude Behavior you are a violent rage Behavior there are also practices you want to get good at resentment practice resenting people right if you can't get good at forgiveness guess what you got to practice it he's worth it so there's things that devotees want to practice even if they're not good at them right to tell me where very addicted to meeting it's not a weird thing it's a practice we were practicing eating it and we might even have a deeper attachment do we even know that
okay
 but we have to practice to get out of it if we want the results of in a bit being a devotee and living a lifestyle as a devotee and getting the benefits that go with that everything's a practice and I find and I noticed and be open to what you think about this too I find a real car make and the subtle body really kicks in through puberty and that's where you start to find can what
 that's the sexual stuff that route that b access to that kind of hard not just sexual stuff but parts of the that's where you might go with that here begins when sex keeps asking to go starts to develop as well and it comes back into what they were totally tied to one sexual identity Bubba
okay alright but
 okay but there's a fat ass and it's just not walking around talking about sex all the time there that identity identity is of themself as a being in this world is not cool a gentleness or a harshness that comes with like you don't notice in a child until they go through puberty Detachment from the parents of Detachment from the parents pawlosophy attaching to the parents philosophy of Lifestyle to their offer they're all I find that bit that it it really should have kicked into the kid after they go through puberty not just sexual there's more to life than sex and Rogan asteroid would just be picking you apart right now picking you up in the Trump debate
 oh no you okay
what you got to say about that it's a great question and it's such fascinating science and it's so incredible that these texts these aren't just like religious texts that are just saying you know believe this or you're in big trouble they they really get into understanding all of these aspects of the body the senses the Mind itself so the first question was just at least part of the subtle body travel with the with the soul to the next body the answer is yes actually the whole thing goes with you it's just a question of how much of it you going to be able to access you know which becomes a real important talk about that hang on to that hurts
 I'm not going to start until you put the phone down
 take it from there. Krishna take if I'm graphic day working for him
it don't say it like that right as he's working for the good of the podcast in the people cuz you think you know what's the best for the podcast people know that's a presumption right there the people need you now let's take a deep breath
 y'all worked out I'm going to take the reins back from the store so you are all what happened what happened what you're looking at my hair holding the phone yeah I looked up I just wanted to share that Episode 600 was a past life Memories episode yeah that's what I was thinking I had no beard in that I stayed with you the whole time you were talking to those they're taking it all and I was ready to respond and I have a much more creative intelligence was just that just for my own good just feeling you I'm here and presents
connect but yes really the whole thing comes but you might be saying why don't I remember. Because you don't have access to it all okay and we'll get to that now the next question was are those informations transfer to the sold the time of death and is this what some scars are there not transfer to the soul of the time of death of the soul is is connecting with them all along and then the Soul carry them to the next body and those all of that program and all those informations are going to form the next body right the next body will be formed according to that information and three things three aspects of once rebirth will be determined by the information one is the type of bird that you take a human and an animal male female you know like that
 another is the lifespan how long it'll be and the third is the quality of that life you know what the what the what the quality of the experience will be now the neck
question was what are the scriptural evidence or explanations for how this happens there's many that's all over the place but maybe the most famous what were you thinking of one road maybe the most famous that talks about how the mind is carried to the next body the 15 chapter you have 15 8:15 in the living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life that's what we're talking about conceptions of all that programming some Scotty carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another and it uses an analogy here as they are carries a Roma's thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another greater than OG Kush Bob Krishna like a flower you know will stand in one place but the saddle is part of the flowers fragrance the wind will just laughed over it and then carry it and then
where it goes is really at the power of the wind do you know it's like it's kind of helpless work is carried and so the soul is kind of like that the soul and in our subtle body is carried after that leaves one body and it's kind of
 we land where we land according to Christmas play right now that's 15/8 here's here's part of Shield prabhas commentary on that he says it is stated here that the subtle body
 meaning of mind which carries the conception of the next body right all the programming for your next bodies based on your thoughts in the previous your thoughts your actions but especially how your actions are written into your thoughts
 so it is staying here that the subtle body which carries the conception the next body develops another body in the next life this process of transmigrating from one body to another
 I am struggling well
bodies called car Schutte or the struggle for existence so if there's great information there but there's bits all over the place to talk about this I wanted to share one other place is fascinating part of the bar with time linking porcini bar he's being instructed by Narda a question to the Great Sage Naruto he says the expert knows of The Vedic conclusions say that one enjoys or suffers the results of his past activities
 but practically it is seen that the body that perform the work in the last berth is already lost so how is it possible to enjoy yourself for the reactions of that work in a different body
 no proper rites this in the counter
 he says atheist one evidence for the resulting actions of past activities right you're saying that what I'm experiencing now is based on something I did even in a previous life
the evidence for this therefore they ask what is the proof that I'm suffering and enjoying the result the resulting actions of past Karma
 they have no idea how the subtle body carries the results of the presents bodies actions down to the next roast body
 the present body may be finished grossly but the subtle body is not finished it carries the soul to the next body actually the gross body is dependent on the subtle body
 therefore the next gross body must suffer and enjoy according to the subtle body
 the soul is carried by the subtle body continuously until liberated from gross material bondage zoom out of your an idiot all happening it's see it all happening like wow being a stupid we were twin brothers in
it's life or some like that we have been brothers and then it and then we had the same mother and then we were in our children and then we got influence by spirituality or sometimes we took this weird birth we are going to run into each other again Mary was somehow in the mix what was Mara there was something or older sister who knows you realized you don't own the house you don't own the kids don't own your stuff you're not a New York Italian white male around we just been blowing around with different again in the same way you know something I'm in a beautiful a beautiful lady breathtakingly beautiful lady gets in a Volvo and then she gets out of a Volvo and she gets in a really crappy old Volkswagen run GMC Gremlin or she gets into a Ford Bronco 2 changing vehicles and in one sense she has
nothing to do with how that Bronco drives are the we're having a old Volkswagen without the power steering doesn't work etcetera so
 it's not that the soul is intelligent because I'm intelligent that that's all that's all Hardware the soul the soul of completely separate them settle body it just uses that machine in the same way a person use the machine to get they get into a Volvo and then they get out and they get into an excavator and they've a whole different body you thinking just like me right now
 okay that's good but but no because your analogy one step further okay and then I'm going to take that one a little further to and you're going to be amazed
now imagine that like when you got in the car and you drove the car that you had like a pen drive write a pen drive yeah and you know like with a USB input and you would snap that into the dashboard and what that pen drive is stuck recording everything about how you're driving like and it's in that in that pen drive is connected to you could say the senses of the car right like it's connected to a camera that's in the car whatever you're seeing through the car it's got its got microphones that are picking up the sound that's reaching the car Etc right
 and as you drive how you respond to what's going on in the highway
 is all being recorded on that pen drive so like for instance if you're cutting people off it's being recorded
and drive okay if your speeding is being reported on the pen drive if when the siren is being heard you don't respond appropriately it's being recorded on the pen drive road rage pen drive it's all being recorded on the pen drive and when you're done and you can you drive that car for Less a year and then when you're done you take that pen drive and you go to like the you go to a counter to get your car for the next year
 and then there's a person behind the counter that takes that pen drive plugs it in gets a reading and says okay for the next year you'll be driving this car
 and they'll be like they may be like all this great look like iCarly maybe like hold it you know then they then you get in and you plug in that pen drive into your new car and you realized I don't have even that may be there
even there's air condition cut you don't have access to the air conditioner
 it seems like I cannot drive this car over 55 miles an hour you know I was like my last car I was able to drive that thing a hundred miles an hour yeah well the problem was you driving a hundred miles an hour and 55 mile an hour Zone in this body you're only going to be able to drive in 55 if you don't have access to that speed anymore Laura be no says her Geico app does that okay so interesting and drive was I thought your pen drive is a bad analogy truthfully but actually it's already cuz I've never heard of anything doing that but somehow will analogy but buddy stay with you're not done yet okay I'm still with you I'm here okay
 it's because your arm is out front right at this very obvious that you're going to the chat board and reading it like crazy I'm just stretching out
so so so here's the idea right there's a system in place
 that's meant to train you to drive in a sensitive an appropriate way you don't even let say before you got in the car in the first place you're given a manual here is the right way to drive here's the responsible and righteous way to drive and your and if you drive that way you're going to find that you get more freedom and and ability to do more on the highway but if you don't there's going to be consequences for it and then that hand drive is recording everything and then you hand it to the judge in a sense and they they determine what your next body is so your body was made up of which recorded that that that pen drive is like your mind is like the some scars in your mind and it's all recorded there
 now what what our situation is is like is that judge is not only taking the pen drive at the end of thing he's in your car with you and that's the parmatma right up our mom is with
with every decision you make and it's all your thoughts and all of your decisions
 in cases are recorded in your mind and it's all access by the part of Mama right there in your heart and it's determining what your next body will be not now listen to this this this is the answer to the question by King Virginia bar he was saying what how can we hear he said how is it possible to enjoy yourself for the reactions of the work that was done in a different body but that's body's gone now and not a response like this the great station already continued the living entity acts in a gross body in this life this body is forced to act by the subtle body right it's the it's the mine that's moving the body
 which is composed of the Mind intelligence and ego
 after the gross body has lost the subtle body is still there to enjoy your supper
that's there is no change or it just like we moved from one car to another no property rights in the country
 one may change the gross body but he works in the subtle body
 people cannot understand the activities of the subtle body and consequently they are bewildered as to how the actions of one gross body affect another gross body the activities of the subtle body are also Guided by the Super Soul as explained in Bhagavad Gita 1515
 Starbucks Ketchum
 ready Sunnyview still mithaas Mitchell Piano a poem sure I'm seated in everyone's heart
 and from me, remembrance knowledge and forgetfulness not think about this this is a really interesting idea
 remember it's knowledge and forgetfulness knowledge is all that we've gained all that we have on our hard drive is our knowledge
 and Remembrance is the ability to access that knowledge
and forgetfulness is the inability to access that knowledge right so like this the part of Mama's they're saying I'm going to give you access to this I'm not going to give you the access to that according to how you've been living living in the choices that you've made I've got it all right here on the pen drive in a sense right and I'm going to give you access to certain things I'm not going to give you access to others I'm going to give you a member and seven give you forgetfulness is really just access right he can to the report continues because the Supreme personality got it as Super Soul is always guiding the individual soul the individual soul always knows how to act according to the reactions of his past Karma
 I'd like some people know how to make money they have access to that knowledge some people don't they have no access you know the little turtle want to bust out of the out of the shell on the beach to get this access to this now is run you know it's just better
The Nest they don't come out of the shell
 turtles are born Turtles shells come out of the show course they do
 I'm going to come out of the egg
 will the tag is a she'll do that she'll come out there Turtles like some Bugs Bunny cartoon with a rubbery I'm not sure if it's like a crack chicken egg but go on it and they come out of that she'll come out and they have some instincts to go run to your life is pomegranate them access to remembrance it's dangerous now so because of supreme personality of super Souls always guiding the individual soul the individual soul always knows how to act according to the reactions of his path
in other words the Super Silver Mine seem to act in such a way there for although there is apparently a change in the gross body there's a continuation between the lives of an individual's Soul so so the whole thing of karma is just that it's like this Cosmic sensitivity training
 and all of its recorded there in the mind and then the part of my mother got in the heart is granting us access you not to be able to remember or to not be able to remember to be able to access or not access the memory that we say like well if we're in another body why don't remember why don't we remember it we're not going to that access you know and and probably a good thing you know because it be like just too much emotional stuff going on that we couldn't for granted certain access and were denied certain access and you know Krishna said like on the 10th and the 10th chapter the Heat
 that dumb what is it there
Maurice's
 Dallas versus live in my mind right now but you know what to do with your constant devoted to serving me with love his arm stuck at the use of personal pretty poor become the dominant I give them the understanding by which they can come your access to understanding the truth by which they can come to me you know it's it's the Parma, granting access and denying access when is karma it's it is within a sensitivity training system just like it's going to say you can't drive you got no air condition this card that you got to do better if you're going to get a better one next time you know and then and then when you turn to them and really want understand then the knowledge is granted to come to Krishna and that's why you know it's a it's a path of individual Endeavor combined with Grace in a we make the Endeavor to turn back and then God grants you access to understand everything that we need to understand and can light up the mind and light up the heart just by granting us access to
