 yeah we have back to recovery meetings today at noon and 1:30 p.m. eastern time and tomorrow is Cult of Cain Josh cane sauce in a class for Patriot members at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow at 11
 it probably never said the word nectar before I became a devotee now I said that there like three times a day after in the fridge
 what does devotee words isn't it a thumbs down
I need some nectar right now okay we got some anyway this is from your friend and mine Albert Einstein Albert Einstein
 yeah this was a large let's see what Einstein has to say all right Einstein he was writing to someone named Robert Marcus who is incredibly distraught after his young son died
 holy oh yeah and then I thought that that's interesting because we're reading a story about someone who wishes he says a human being is spatially and temporally limited piece of the whole
 that we call the universe
is a spatial in temporarily limited piece of the hole but we call the universe experiences himself and his feelings as a separate from the rest and optical illusion of his consciousness
 the Quest for Liberation from this bondage were illusion is the only object of True Religion
 not nurturing the illusion but only overcoming it gives us the attainable measure
 of inner peace did Albert Einstein live in the ashram how does he know this stuff while he's got my headaches all of those all of those scientists that were working together at that time and his whole crew and I definitely had an interest in a pint of shots and Bug of agita in Heimer is something you'd hear in an above a Time class or
 living in some ashram in India a human being is a
spatially and temporally limited piece of the whole time is Bass Hall the universe quotation marks
 he experiences himself and his feelings as separate from the rest and optical illusion of his Consciousness the Quest for Liberation from his bondage or Illusion is the only object of True Religion not nurturing the illusion right now wieners for the illusion that nurturing the illusion but only overcoming it gives us the attainable measure of inner peace be the most comforting thing for a person who's grieving or maybe the most comforting thing
 I think it's more company to someone like me who the children are not sick or dying some like that and I like that I can make sense and then maybe three years later or five years later 20 years later 30-40 years later when something happens like well remember that valuable piece of information it may not be the most comforting information at the moment that everything
I think that's comforting I don't know I think I'd be happy like
 but you know I think we tend to go off on our mission seeing ourselves as separate
 and
 from that from that Paradigm is from that Paradigm that we operate that we begin our decision making we make it within that Paradigm right I'm A Separate Peace and I got to make sure I get what I need and get what I want and then I'll find out if this and then I'll find peace
 and Einstein you do with his his scientific Outlook he's he's recognizing somehow
 and everything's tied together
 and it's only through realizing that do we begin to see truth and it's only through truth do we find peace
 yeah this this goes right this goes right to
I mean it's interesting here I don't know how we got there right I mean imagine all these guys are like rage do you know Jewish or Christian in the in the abrahamic traditions and all the sudden glimpse of the upanishads you find some old tax somebody translated like wow look what these got look with his head and they did this clicks with our scientific research yeah and you know but one we if if your say where do we see this being discussed and I want sex all over the place but of course within Bobbitt on that we're reading
 you know early on we got this conversation that's going on between Vishnu right who is that being that ties every he is that Central piece
 right that that's kind of like the Hub the route
he is that nourishing piece he is a piece that holds all the other pieces together
 and he speaking to Lord Brahma
 the being that he's empowered with the intelligence and the ability to create the universe
 and therefore versus in the Bog time called the Chuck who's Loki the four verses that summarize the entire teachings of the Bible time
 what are we to buy with some Doritos for when you're done
 but this is versus in relation to that this room says to Vermont obermeyer whatever appears to be a value of any value
 if it is without relation to me real in other words if you see it without relation to me
 it has no reality no it has my illusory energy that reflection which appears to be in the Darkness
Okay so
 what are illusion is not nice to see what we see in this world is not an illusion but when we see it disconnected from the central
 from The Hub from the root then were an illusion
 we are so prone to seeing it that way because we want to exploit it for their own enjoyment thinking that that will bring us happiness with that will bring us peace what Einstein is recognizing is not a no actually that doesn't bring peace it's only an understanding this truth write a leaf to Leaf might be thing it if I can just break free from the tree I'll be free I can get whatever I want now
 you'll you'll find peace when you realize
 your nature as intrinsically connected to the root it's a route that nourishes you
 it wasn't right I'm totally with you
try to imagine what if he did live in ashram back to Albert enough philosophizing clean up after the Sunday feast
 now would you like to hear a bit of the comment or two levers yeah are you sure eager on the edge of my seat right now probably look up property rights in the previous verse that has already been concluded that in any stage of the cosmic manifestation and its appearance and its sustenance its growth its interactions with different energies it's deterioration and its disappearance write the whole cycle from creation to destruction all of it has basic relation with the existence of the personality of got it
 he's there
 caring in a holding it by the hands you know he's the one there that's moving it through all those different through all the different facets
all the different aspects of its cycle through creation and Destruction has all has its basic relation with the existence of the first time they've got it and as such whenever there's forgetfulness of this Prime relation Prime relation right they may have be into I may be interacting with you with you and I may have a relation Rogan us but our Prime relation is with that Center existence just like leaves may have the relationship you know everyday but their Prime relations with the route
 so again at such whenever there's forgetfulness of this Prime relation with the Lord and whenever things are accepted as real
 without being related with the Lord that conception is called a product of the illusory energy for Lord because nothing can exist without the Lord and should be known that the illusory energy is also the energy of the Lord the right conclusion of dovetailing
everything in relation with the Lord is called yogamaya the energy of the Union interesting right
 the energy that centripetal force that moves me towards the central core I know I was thinking about you know we had G2G come in and we talked about you know holidays are coming up and there's some pain that people suffer with some family of origin issues of the group in a dysfunctional or traumatic family experience and now we're supposed to go home for the holidays and how does that relate I'm going to resurrect some same Dynamic that I had forty years ago thirty years ago 10 years ago
 and I was thinking
 everybody who has a family right or is connected with the family or has children and he's like they need they need to hear this stuff they need to hear that the primary relationship with the kids with your brothers and sisters and your siblings with your aunts and uncles with your parents is spiritual so even though we we get caught up in this this is my family these are my. This is how we reacted for ears
interacted for years
 there is one primary main relationship I have with him and that's a spiritual relationship and I have to sort of uncover it and I have to sort of create a bond somehow with them on a spiritual way I should understand that if that doesn't exist
 the bond is really that it it's it's just that temporary but it's that temporary it's it is feudal in a lot of ways I'll be trying to like it it's it's sentimental and
 it won't really be lasting and of course will cause me great pain and suffering and they'll be some fun there as well but we want substantial relationships with all these and then it it will also shed light on in any pain I would have been going through in these relationships especially when it relates to the holidays this is actually
for me to hear this type of stuff is super important as a dad his holidays do bring up things like that as well and I just think it's extra
 it's a m initial but it's extra information to bring into the holiday season
 to share with your family or to just understand himself by myself going into whatever I'm going in to choose not to sometimes I choose not to
 go deeper cuz you got to keep certain people aren't ready to your conversation you just keep it on a surface and you realize you know I'm just doing some duties here of the material world to keep some relative peace and then sometimes people are looking for that and you want to go deeper with it with some spiritual connection with the person or sometimes they haven't been ripe for that for you
and then something happened something ships and they're ready to like they're inquisitive they want to know something when they what do you think about this I'm going through this in and Things become ripe as if on a cloudy day all the sudden one day the sun just comes out and so be ready for that too sometimes people are really ready to go deeper into a relationship relation to action right then right right jump all over that I jump all over that but otherwise these relationships can be very very very superficial you just pleasantries and then and I never push I never pushed but if people get to that point then I push that I push hard because that's the that's the opening and that's where you can actually develop that's why sometimes even in bhakti we have much deeper relationships
 you know you know it might like my relationship with you might like she would like Henry Mara the universe and everything
they're deeper than a lot of my family relationships you know you know my kids are more related to you and Henry and Mara than they are to like their uncles and aunts you know because there's some depth there
 you know this in what sense this is this is where the box of Yogi wants to be they recognize there's two energies that can be flowing through me throw me through flowing through my where my my where is Canby Canby surcharged
 with the energy of Union
 right there at the energy that's that's that when I look through my eyes I see everything is connected to that route I see everything is connected to that how there's something holding everything you guys do something that's nurse and everything or
 if I so desire
 and it is $0.01 if I just let go and let it carry me I could be under the
go to the Muhammad is the diluting energy which when I look when that energy is when my Consciousness is surcharge with that energy
 I'm seeing separation I'm seeing different everywhere I look I'm seeing nothing is connected with that route everything is its own individual Separate Peace that has no intrinsic connection
 an end and he sang it what Einstein say
 is in that state of mind there's no peace and what religion is meant for
 is to help us beat help a c always the connection right and if we have that he says only he says it's only then that we haven't attainable measure of peace and what I liked about one thing I liked about what we're eating right now is Church of Kate so he had no peace because he's when he looked at his son
 he didn't think look my beautiful son
he's got a connection to the root of all existence as do I
 I'd rather he was thinking I'm his route right I'm his route and end in so when he lost his son he was just crushed by but then if you want to call the true religion or to Dharma he was given instructions by the sages he was given instruction by a son that helped him see how everything is connected that that that entered that energy of Union they kind of like it's almost like to say just had an electric charge running through them they held him by the hand and he began to see is dated
 and it gave him that piece I gave that piece of he was he was literally rolling on the ground crying and moaning and and then he came to like everything but not only that in this is where the Bob
time takes us Beyond like conventional they don't it takes us to that very confidential side of spirituality a confidential we don't to nardis said let me give you these mantras that you was understanding Lord Vishnu who's behind everything meditate on this now that you found peace
 meditate plant this seed right in your peaceful mind and watch what Sprouts it wouldn't suck my nuts proud in a mind that had no peace but now your your mind is fertile your heart is fertile you're no longer attached to no longer distracted you can become absorbed in these mantras in them in their meaning and then watch what sprouts and what sprouted was the man who saved America station septic above is right he saw Lord Vishnu and he began his his Consciousness and is eating his body
 became became surcharge Nova wound with ecstasy physical ecstasy's involuntary ecstasy
I always hair standing on end is boys choking up to your point is he's feeling this is his true nature that's underneath it all came out fully blossomed always proud until we're going to read more about this this idea in the verses that he that he that he speaks to Lord mission is he is he speaking out against speaking and its continuing on with continued is just seeing Lord Vishnu and what's just coming out of his mouth this is
 this is Nora and I must put down that I'm shy even wrote them and even satisfied him we have something to do before he shot in the Stream about what time which is our very means of Conquest when should I be respectful of Base to the Supreme Lord Narayan interior and reach you this ship will she would being a mother star swathi the goddess of learning and she will be off today with the author not stop for a show about race
hey Jimbo let's go give it to you too much low-key about the about Bettina HTT the regular tenants in classes in the Bog with Tom and the refinery service De Pere devotees all that is troublesome the movie Karate Kid and loving service to the Supreme Lord he was praised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact again and again I'm going to Jackson. That's why I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open in my life or the torch out of knowledge I offer my little Basin seized after I go to sleep reading from the show by the time Cancel 6 chapter 16 text 4742 speaking
 but your Lord you are the Creator maintainer and Annihilator of this Cosmic manifestation but persons who are too materialistic and who always see separateness do not have eyes
with which to see you
 they cannot understand your real position and therefore they conclude that the cosmic manifestation is independent of your opulence separate my Lord you are the Supreme pure and you are full in all six opulence has therefore I offer my respectful of a since he's on to you but you were the, Terry Road
 paleta is the commentator for the commentary 47 atheistic men think that the cosmic manifestation has come out come about by chance by a combination of matter
 that's pretty crazy theory if you think about it God I mean Prince to God materialistic so
called chemists and atheistic philosophers always try to avoid even the name of God I hate the name of God in a relationship in the relation to the cosmic station
 for them God's creation is impossible to understand because they are too materialistic the Supreme personality of godhead is parma hamsa or the Supreme pure whereas those who are simple
 excuse me very much attached to a material sense enjoyment
 and then for engaging material activities like asses
 are the lowest among men
 all their so-called scientific knowledge is null and void because of atheistic temperament thus they cannot understand the Supreme personality of godhead so this is like take apart this one line the Supreme person I've got head is parma ham set where the Supreme pure where's those who are
simple be very much attached to material sense enjoyment right here's another another idea then again we hear this simple and we think like we're doing something bad and now God is going to punish us whereas when we when we take that approach it's real inch wood relinquishing in one sense our responsibility I use that example of if I shoot out the wheels of my car with a shotgun
 it's a dog's think about doing that Christopher thinking about you and someone hit my car now I'm going really slow if I want to go to the store I did it to myself so are our bad choices create a bad reaction and the instructions of God and we here in Henryville revealed the literature is just having to have a smoother drive in this world
and what is it it's attachment to sense enjoyment like why is that so evil it's not that evil is evil it just keeps you're bound up by the body it it makes you think that the body is the self it just endorses illusion I bought the Albert Einstein was saying it endorses the illusion that you are a sensual be when you're when you're actually a spiritual being your carnal being where you're actually Spiritual Beings we look out to find our pleasure instead of looking into find our pleasure and so then we get we get a call this is a great word of the bog of music you like an ass either you become like an ass and in any took Wing It Word and a sword like the lowest among men and ass is a beast of burden doesn't incredible amount of work and what do they get in return they just get a little water little grass
 it's like living in New York
city right working your butt off in New York City what does it take to get New York city so expensive anyway because because what are you because there's so much more effort just a just a commute to work is exhausting packed in a place where you don't have to go so far when you live in the city when you live outside the city and work in the city you know what I
 but I live in Los Angeles and that's an exhausting to get to work that's crazy when I teach yoga in Upstate New York I was like what a beautiful drive to driving but it was just charm it was a Charming drive so that the passionate cultures like New York City or La it's so I'm just using that of course you can be an ass anywhere in the world you can be an ass living in the forest but if you're in the city just exemplifies it cuz it's Bill with a passion ignorance
and you're working hard everything's expensive you know you want to drink I want to drink a $12 drink
 and then what happens you get your this is where you get to live you get to live in this little box and you have a window and what you can see in your window you can see a tree if you're lucky that's it
 there's no trees under Street this is like it's just it exemplifies we work and he get this much in return
 I was as a reading the school what what prophet is speaking about here
 he's saying a materialistic so-called chemists so on canvas was a chemist someone that studies chemicals
 okay we have our alliance time now I've noticed you know like
people that like have some kind of religious or spiritual Faith are they always want to pull Einstein on their side I researched this quote in and found a whole article is written about the exact source of where this came from where was quoted in different newspapers over different years was in the running to Eastern philosophy about that it did mention that yes and then it went and found even the handwritten note and then translated from German so that they made sure that they had the right context and in the in the right translation
 and it here's my point that you do I know on the other hand you have like the empiricists and in the wood we get the turn the use but like for rum
 for this new brand of kind of Pop Culture atheist
scientist scientist you know the con like are there different names for them but like they're almost like a religious
 religious atheist or something like that in their ATM is so is like a religious fervor them okay okay now when I look at Einstein and I haven't studied him in-depth everything and I don't even know if I could but you know when I read some of the impression that I get is that he was objective you know he wasn't I don't seem committed to any particular
 spiritual tradition but I see him open to them and engaging with them respectfully at least that you don't find that nowadays so much you just said about like the G word you can't say God or else you're sort of written off as some sentimental fool you know like let's say that I were one of these religious atheists you know do you know I pee on television shows and
speak about people who have faith in a God or a god being a Creator a maintainer and I'm and I'm just constantly with a with it a ton of condescension just like making that face right when I'm doing my research
 and if there's a little thread that I could pull on you don't otherwise I have my theory and I find some something to back up my theory but I see a thread there
 and I know well if I'm going to see if this holds I need to pull on that thread
 I need to pull on it even has a small threat I need to pull on it and see if it still holds up
 if my whole reputation you know how I if if if I pull on that thread and find oh my God
 you know my theory didn't hold you know perhaps there is you know
perhaps Consciousness is something that's not produced out of matter perhaps there is a designer you know I will be hesitant to sincerely pull on that thread
 if I presented myself if I've mocked you know cuz it's going to be so hard for me at that point to say oh I was wrong you know and people that have that attitude that's super condescending attitude that they have the hardest time admitting that they're wrong and so so how does so my point being how does that affect my research
 can I be truly objective in my research can I be a true scientist in my research you know if I'm not ready to overturn every stone and really examine
 and so I appreciate Einstein so he's not he's not in one sense he's not even saying over there is a God exactly but he saying when I look I see everything's tied together something's holding all this together right
and then he says it in a very interesting way religion should be for finding that what is it that's holding everything together what what is it that makes nothing separate that there's something I'm seeing something tying it all together and I think religion should be all about finding out that I appreciate that you know like I see him is objective you know he may we may not share all the same ideas but I see that he's engaging with this kind of an engagement with with tax like Upon a Child in bug of agita respectfully sure at least he's trying to be objective and I may we can't be fully objected because we are limited in what we can perceive and maybe we even to be blindsided by our own the way we find it by signs could be a little blinded by science
 squirrel Massacre scuba my dear Lord it is after you and ever that Lord Brahma Indra
and the other directors of the cosmic manifestation become occupied with their activities it is after you've received the material energy my Lord that the senses begin to perceive the screen person out of god holds all the universes on his head's like seeds of mustard we haven't seen a mustard seed they're great tiny little balls
 48 after a special Basin season to you that's a pretty person I've got head with thousands of hoods
 so you can have this one we continued the Lord the Supreme personality of godhead ananta Dave be very much pleased with the prayers offered by King pitcher K to the king of the Vdara replied to him as follows Hillcrest to know who Dynasty Mars Prickett so here is Now official order the ham respond
okay as a result of you or having accepted the instructions spoken about me by the Great Sage Narda and sages Narda and Amira you have become completely aware of transcendental knowledge because you are now educated and spiritual sight in the spiritual science you have seen me face-to-face there for you are now completely perfect sure like a promise isn't it like this is what's going to happen
 this is what can happen to you and he seemed what's what's tying it all together now you got it you clicked into the spiritual science you see it all tied together all living entities moving and now moving are my expansions and are separate from me I'm a super soul of all living beings who exist because I manifest them why do you exist because you manifest you I'm the form of the transcendental vibrations like own Cara
and Hari Krishna Hari Rama and I'm the Supreme absolute truth these two forms of mine namely the transcendental sound and the eternally Blissful spiritual form of the deity are my eternal forms they are not Material okay today I think of yourself that I like
 the sound vibration when done with the appropriate intention and appropriate attention
 can be like a combination to it you can give it to one of those in the banks they have like those old-fashioned safes like these gigantic saves with the ship wheel on it everything on leashes and the whole Vault opens and then there's the treasures
 the holy name is like that treasure first of all the proper attention and intention
hearing that name and you're just working this combination and then it's going to walk the great well it just appears right just like what is a safe of your life is just like a big wall you don't understand that you might understand this anything behind it there's something incredibly valuable but behind it but you can't get through it's it it's sealed off to us but we're given here by the great Saints the acharya's a combination lock now non-spiritual scientists right you just have no faith in a spiritual science they'll be like well I don't see anything valuable here but you can't get into this to the wall here I've turned the Giant Wheel there's nothing there's a way to do it and there's a combination lock we've been handed
 and if you think about everybody who's coming here
they're Also spiritually have a spiritual sentiment you know that changes caused a box turtle sentiment the ego fever has to lower and when the eagle fever is high it's a block it's a say it's a giant sealed right it's taking like Krishna on the eve of Gita jayanti
 but the combination is here would you want to know how you're thinking like a Christian on the eve of the Jedi tell me tell me cuz this is this is really where where I'm really adding and what I'm writing right now when I'm working at
 is is this idea the Christmas says that he says that there's a confidential aspect of a Toronto
 right who young says buddy speaks about the combination understanding it and it's not renunciation not austerity not intelligence
none of these things that are, you know brought up in in in the studies of the less confidential aspect of vedanta
 but he said if it has to do the state of one's heart
 right that you're not envious that you're like a devoted friends Oktoberfest in Mesa call j.t. Russian the mystery or something confidential Altima means like the most write the deepest Mystery Box do seem a Pity because you're my devoting my friend there for you can understand the transitory nature of this greatest mystery right in the Night chapter Raja video Rodger William this is the greatest of neurologist right this is the most the most guarded secret but what does he speak about when when you opened up like this somebody Falls he says you can understand it because you're not envious right
 he says
what did because Target is that behind all the workings of this universe
 there's a director in an Altima that directors of person this is the confidential aspect of a doctor if you study vedanta you know all those that study bit until they they accept Bhagavad Gita. But it's right there the Christian saying that there's a confidential in the 15 chapter kooyong to come sjostrom the most guarded secret the highest secret of all the shots drove all the way to get literature has to do with understanding The Princess and I'm behind everything I'm making it all move I make you know if it's all connected to me
 and so I I like the way that you said that right not to know it's like you know that that's safe is there there's a combination to that safe but that combination is not austerity that gives you the combination
got intelligence it's not it's not a scholarship you are right and it has to do with the state of your heart and the hearts are Kristen you open up because Krishna the absolute truth the origin of everything is Abby and just like beings in this world you know I'm looking at the like I'm looking at the resume Zoomers right now we got Martin and Henry and and Saraswati you know than Manish Manish I can't just order Manish to reveal his most intimate part of himself to me you just tell me everything about yourself right now
 you know I want to look her up when I understand you I'm looking right at you right now just going to let it shake you around that's not going to do it because he's a big if I approach with the appropriate attention and intention
 to love
he starts to reveal himself to me she starts to build herself to me and that's what how love works in this world it doesn't come to force it comes through a sentiment and a sentiment hide with attention to detail right now in intention what it like you know we've all mixed in a relationship with a person has ill intentions and after a while we pick up on it like a favor for my beer to try to use me for my body whatever it is but when we see person to ask this person is great intentions and that goes through trusting us and proving ourselves then all of a sudden love starts a really flow out of that person the same as with Christian and Christian is always wants to send that's why we go through these stumbling blocks cuz Krishna wants us with our best
tensions only and that's it that night and then he will reveal himself and will happen if things will surface will start to realize wow I'm doing this for even though I'm doing this to show off I'm doing this for Prestige I'm doing this to you no gain followers I'm doing this and Christian will not let you close these things will keep manifesting you keep having a stumbling block You'll Play in Chris. You'll play in the community you'll blame the religion and church now it's all for our purification and then we can come closer and closer and closer with all that stuff sheds because Chris is ready to give it to us he's ready to open up that that Treasure Trove at Fort Knox of love but we got to we got to come correct
 how come correct, correct you sure Mary Mary's coming correct use her motive is good and everything very very good motives she wants you for your wealth may be rather Shifty
just like that was he laugh when I said that off I need a prenup
 I want to see the combination is being spoken of here in two things are being mentioned one is the Mantra the sound the spiritual sound the names the transit on vibrations that are objects of meditation
 and the other is is the form of the DD right the Archer vigrah right now if you hear from someone like these
 it Neo religious atheists
 you know they won't try to understand it you know we've we Spoken Here by like how to have a
productive argument and means like I try to represent the side that I'm arguing against even better than they can represent themselves right I need to really understand them and then articulate what their position is it one of these days about 6 I'm like Deedee worship they're just going to paint it
 end it in such a way that it appears absolutely ridiculous oh there's some God in the form of some you no carb statue and you're convinced that if we don't supplicate ourselves to that statue that earthquakes are going to come and floods are going to call him and Charles because it's envious and jealous and angry and that's your God and he just wants to manipulate you and now you know that's not at all
 the idea is one that that that that Consciousness that ties everything together penetrates everything
and therefore is within this form but that the form is really about us bringing our minds to the form and Transforming Our Minds in that way red like we are tension going so many different directions
 but if I learn to bring my mind to that form and then I performed the rituals
 the train my mind to think and to see in a different way on a daily basis
 then I begin to see the connections in the world that that Albert Einstein's talk about work where I'm prone not to see them
 I'm prone to get caught up in my own feelings of separateness and seeing everything is separate in my own exploit of nature if I can begin to see beauty not in a separate form that I want to exploit but Beauty in this form of God that I want to connect with right that if if if I can see happiness not in trying to manipulate everything extra
with me as a center which I'm clearly not but I begin to understand that I can find happiness by serving the center and it was the mood of love
 that's what's cultivated through the ritual of worshipping the DD
 now if you're going to go ahead and explain that first and then explain why you don't have face in it then I can accept that you're no Jack right hind but if you're just going to paint it in the end in some kind of tones that have nothing to do with what the people are actually doing then I know that you're not sincere you're not objective therefore I again I appreciate Einstein give me to write a timer
 ready for some takeaways for some music some songs
