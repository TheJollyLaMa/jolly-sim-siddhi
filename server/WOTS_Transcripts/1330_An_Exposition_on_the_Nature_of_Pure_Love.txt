 good morning everybody
 good morning. How are you it's walking Wednesday walking Wednesday is a day when we bring people on that we think are sorta cool they tell the story a little bit but today we're going to talk about this age group because one part you know what you were trying to think of like what are we are we a podcast and that's always the obvious question where podcast but without planning this business has become more of a community and the podcast so we have these things called sage groups and they've been incredibly outrageously successful and you know I'm not taking any of the credit because the stupid did it was his who was his brainchild his baby cuz stupid birth to baby and is called the same age groups and I'm very proud of them and its people loving it and it's transformational
 cell is to be able to say something about Sage Grouse before we bring it on stage
I wish I were but but maybe we should just check in with me real quick for any announcements that she may have meetings going on today at 1 and 9:30 eastern time we can check out back to your cover group.com and come over here for the details and then also tonight at 8 p.m. City Krishna right now you know why I read that one cuz scuba is one day you read that to me when we were young man you said sit down and read you a story and you read me and I sat there at your feet and I said mama bird feed me
 yes I know but we didn't end with that we started reading another one
you're reading the Christmas saves
 the son of his teacher comes back to life two sons of his teachers Sunny Bunny money so that's up for patreon subscribers they can tune in to the
 to Baby Krishna with Robert tonight tonight at 8 p.m. Harry Bolton so what stage do you know the idea is that you know you may listen to the podcast and appreciate some of the wisdom from the srimad bhagwat time of the wisdom of the ancient sages that we talked about in the show and and as you as our new opening says you know that the other ideas we want to make this ancient wisdom relevant make it come alive in our life but if we're just you know we may live in our own or we just may not have a lot of people that practice Buckley around us or even if we do give me to live right next door to a person to be hard to spend time with him how it tastes you notice the way the world is in their house
even then never going in and out a lot here he has sent to this age groups you know there's a study aspect to it you know generally it's a it's a small group to get together online look through resume there's there's a kind of you know a person that's experiencing bhakti generally is kind of like a host of it in a sense that kind of the you could say the same group leader but they're not really a teacher there more just like there to facilitate the discussion it's really about opening up having a place where you can discuss about the present your questions present your challenges in life share what you're going through good you know whether it's you-know-who good or bad you know whatever
 whatever going through in life make friends you know make friends develop some friendships get a little guy than sometimes it's just it's a it's a little Community you know this age groups go for about usually go for about 16
weeks and then we break them up and then we set up new groups and people can join a group so you can move around a little bit and it's a different group some of the groups have different themes that thing it's not so much in terms of exactly what they discussed but themes of what people share in, like there's some groups that are like for parents you know like everybody in the group is a parent or there's lgbtq group there's men's groups women's groups I think apartment on his is like a hardcore group people in the hardcore punk rock get into that but it's just people with a you know a similar background so we're this week is the last week for session 6 of of the sage group
 if we had 06 16 weeks sessions or so over the past few years and I think it's on what is it merits a Jew
first that people can register for the upcoming sageworks
 can hear you registration opens June 1st registration open June 1st in I'll tell you a little bit more about that when we wrapped up a why don't we check in with her I guess
 bring on Jamie stepdad you when you have enough Prabhu
 so is an old old friend of ours and body Centre from New York City he's a comedian a performer actor and sweet sweet to Bodie and yeah man. How are you it's great to see you welcome to the show paid real money did you tell Chloe I didn't double it
 great
what's your favorite part I'm not finished with it yet
 started wise guy you just got initiated yeah it's it's just great it's punchy and it really put you there and thank you for boo now enough about me tell us about the age groups and I talked to us yet or not this age group leader yeah but you know in listening to kiss to bubu describe it I've been doing it all wrong I've been doing I've been having them read from my the manuscript my autobiography is a difficult experience there's this
 do this knowing States up is it underlying Relentless love that is there which iPhone
we have to blame the two of you for I think it's back to you it it's these groups are are great because everybody is just so supportive of each other no matter what's going on we created a safe space and what's great about the group's is like a super was saying it's not about the leader it's about each member of the group being able to create this safe space so in my experience there has been this really refreshing lack of judgment no matter what's going on people are are willing to open up and and be themselves Express who they are talk about struggles people are connecting with each other I've had people who who have been initiated and it's sort of falling away and have sort of come back because of this podcast and then well let me you know I'm not really associated with the hoodies
let me join a group and see how that's working out and it's been a powerful experience for them just to connect because you say very often there's nobody around you know it may be my group of friends thinks what I'm doing is ridiculous but there's something that resonates with me about it so you know where's my outlet for that bill sage bush has been perfect for that and Grace so happy that you did that you host to that you lead a group b
 and so you've had a few people this past week it's super Soul Martin Lindsay Yuri I have been part of the group pictures of them together which is really satisfying, plus when they come in to the New York area I get to see people you have seen Scott and Laura and you Kendra that way so we're taking pictures of ourselves send them to me
it's just a bit strange and bring the sleep you know potentially Global Dominican mangu between Japan and Global yeah around the world just coming together for this shared experience we have about 40 groups or so at different times different days of the week is it is global so you know sometimes you need to join a group just to the time consideration you know like with an hour that will work for you so we try to put out a lot of a lot of possibilities and they're all great people you know what all of them if so I've been really impressed by the people that you to attract well how much do you think it would cost to join a group like this $7,000 and $9,000 no $5,000 you get yourself into a sage group
 no wait you got charged enough to free your business coaching
you're free
 free data free
 you're actually entirely free so we're very excited about it service in a way to build community friendships and more than anything up a place like you said a safe space I hate that word but it is a safe space where you can actually just share your heart with people in confidence that are like-minded without judgment wow nice is Timothy talk to her just put up on the message board this age group has been my rocket fuel for my back you practice we bring up James step is it time for Jamie step-by-step Doja who's this age group member member he's my tractor Guru he gives me his tractor advice where the oil the pinch points and where to dig we're not to dig Landscaping genius
walking the show Harry Krishna Hari Bol
 how are you what you like being this age group how is it helped you defected you you don't live in a temple obviously you don't live near Temple you come to Super Soul occasionally this whole Christmas thing was very very peculiar to you you don't you don't think you work for the city you handle big big big equipment and somehow your chance 16 rounds and always hearing and Channing tell us about this age groups and how it's affected your life
 first of all I'd be lucky if I could hit the nearest of OT with a cruise missile honestly. I am literally in the middle of nowhere when it comes to Berkeley so feeling like I'm in a box of desert it literally is like an oasis ice age group is like an oasis I can tell you honestly that when there's that break in between stage groups I feel lost
I'm a little bit I really do and I really look forward to it there's been a lot of times when I was sort of like I have to do that tonight you know and I have to login you know I had a long day or whatever and I'm always always Grateful by the time I'm done being so it's like going to the gym sometimes and I know that everything the commitment right I'm going to be there yeah yeah absolutely rocking office I think spoken about this a lot it's like when I do what I want to do anyway I'm never satisfied like I'm never feel better when I just do what I want to do I don't feel good but you want to do what you want to do that's exactly what it is and like I said my age group every single one of them has been amazing I've got to have a associate
with very very senior devotees bio Prabhu nityananda my sage group leader we had one very senior devotee stop V I think she's a problem pod disciple and so aside from like sort of being all in this together I've gotten to see like what an example of a lifetime of devotional service actually looks like not like an action but like getting comfortable and seeing how they actually conduct themselves aside from watching yourselves on a daily basis and it's just seem like they're family Dynamics and stuff like that and it's just like it's so beautiful I really really really is and it's been a huge part Lake Association with the bodies has been everything for for my whole spiritual pass it's really been Association that store
launch me that's propelled me sustain me you know and so it really is like I said I can't key I keep coming back to it's really like an oasis in the desert association with the Bodhi Spa in so it's just been like I said everything to me I keep picking this and under because honestly I first of all the time slot is perfect for me I have a lot of stuff going on during the week and Wednesday nights at 7:30 is just perfect but then again I could probably go through five lifetimes and still have things to learn from him he's just so wise and there's just so much stuff that he knows and I just feel really comfortable like if there's like a tough question that maybe I wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable asking a senior to you because I'm not that you know intimate with you know intimately familiar with them I can ask someone like the tough questions without feeling like
you know embarrassed or like it if it's inappropriate and get like a really really reasons sort of empathetic answer about that there that's always something else that impresses me about senior devotees is the is the sort of the reasoned like it there's just so much
 I want to say confidence but there's just the the philosophy is so sound that there's there's never any like sense of right I have to win this debate it's just always logic it's just always Sound Logic and it's sad that so attracted to me so
 beautiful Sage groups like giving hope to the modern world is beautiful we got a secret message I got a private message on the message board that said Jamie influenced the entire Sage group The Champ Or Joppa
you're doing something good Jamie
 anything else you want to share what when's the next stage of when signing up what happened to Joanne can they get the same people again how does this whole thing work so the way that you find out about this and register for now as you go to wisdom to stages.com and then you go to say troops I think it's the group's Sage group leaders and and you know if most most of the groups are like kind of just like generic groups and but if their group has like some particular theme then it also let you know about that and what time it is and then you can choose you know this about
 use it as a few hundred people involved in them and like a little over 40 groups because the groups are small you know what other words in order to in order to really share the group can't be too big and it's it's
otherwise there's no opportunity for everyone to speak and share so that means that if you have a particular group that you want to get in only about eight people are going to get into that group and hundreds are going to be signing up so that means you know as the days pass there's less opportunity again in in any particular group so I think by Friday night latest all the new all all the new groups will be listed and in their time slots and and and their leaders and all that and I think that registration probably opens up at midnight you know on for Saturday morning you know that going into Saturday so Saturday would be the first day to sign up if you want to get it I recommend you you tune in early you know you knew sign up early so that you have the opportunity to most likely get in the group that you want to get
 beautiful what kind of themed groups are there out there that you can join well I name a few
you know this like ladies groups in men's groups I think hardcore Tina lgbtq hardcore parenting class for a rock if anamaris are you coming back this time there I did come on yes yes say yes ma'am no I not
 travel schedule and everything is traveling a lot this season as good as that mean that
 you'll come back for the next session
 I'd like to I had such a great group earnings package from book distributor
I would have got her for this session I'm persuasive tactics
 all right everyone loved to have been there is group was Mira and Bobby together is very popular and we had a brother nature as part of our group it in Watson
 it's like there's this is Treasures of special people that are hosting these leading these groups Shore and then there's wonderful people that are in the group's it's really you know for people that are into it over they're realizing all I'm I'm you know what you go through like let's say you go through in the course of a year you go through three groups so that's you know like say three groups to let you know you met 25 people about you know and you become close with them because you share you know it's up it's a place where you really open up so
you'll make lifelong friendships you know really important meaningful friendships friendships with people that understand your spiritual path that encourage one another because it's hard you know the way the momentum is in this world nowadays with all the media and in the long hours that we work and and being separated from families and separated from dear ones broken families you know the issues that we have people really feel alienated they feel isolated isolated and it's hard to have the determination to stick to something even to read a book you need like a book group you know that the book club you know it's a real book I need a community to help me get even with adapter be pleased to devour books you know and now it's like hard but you get in a good book club and it really helps because you know that you share yeah you got your account just like Jameson sometimes I don't want to show up but they make a commitment to each other unless there's really some serious reason I can't, I'm going to be there and and then you walk away glad that you that you joined end
it it helps you like like I want to practice this I want to follow principles I want to bring healthy regulations into my life it helps that when you check in on the do you know the next weekend and you know that you going to be checking in the next weekend people going to say so how's it going you you said you wanted to read a chapter bug of agita everyday is it are you able to do it you know I wasn't to do but I know it's going to be here so I've been doing it I'm so glad I've been doing it you know so that kind of yeah kind of be able to make a huge difference what we want to thank you out enough and Jamie step or I'll be a no-show and all you're just your sincerity of heart means a lot it inspires us so thank you you guys for flood warning in the basket down there I'm sure Mom didn't satisfy some overtime which means a conquest when should I expect the base and sees to the Supreme
Gordon Ryan on Turner and Randy see the super most human being at the most are spotty the goddess of learning and she'll be out today at the author naasta pretty soon if she's okay but fear of a Teenage The Key by regular tennis classes in the back of Tom and by rendering service De Pere devotees all that is troublesome the Harley Quinn eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the tragedy of the songs will be established as a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance and my teachers are opening my eyes or the torch out of knowledge after obeisance he's after Lotus feet reading from mybible.com can do 7 chapter 10
 next one is a new chapter prologue the best among exalted devotees best
 is the
it's not a competition but he's the best but he still the best you know but yeah so is
 it's not a cop but you know there is such a thing as spiritual competition but it's not it's not a competition with your fighting to enjoy the same external resources
 is a competition where you're trying to serve each other better serve me I'm competing with you I'm going to serve you even better it's a competition of selflessness rather than a competition of selfishness selflessness okay that makes sense did you see my post yesterday that said you cannot compete with me I want you to win to stay there is competition transcendental competition but you still want the best in other people are trying to help them do you know who your friend is very meaningful prayer
I want a verse each one kind of you know that guy's a verse of Sanskrit poetry and vested infused with devotional wisdom it with yogic wisdom in it and glorifying Lord Vishnu in the form of the half man half lion and then at the end of the chapter
 Lord Vishnu Express his appreciation a lot and then he only did what you do when you love someone right
 you want to give them something what do you want you know if you do that with mirror every morning I give her a cup of coffee in a song a song She's woken up with a song a new song everyday and a cup of coffee you could release the song I composed the song on the spot okay song that's like Hachi actually while you're are the part of your generation
you know what you know what I love about these offering prayers is it teaches you actually had a pray also it teaches you
 I tried to pray. But devotional prayers are different so when you hear the prayers of prologue it teaches you had a prey by his example and not only that now we're going to learn what to ask for when the Lord says I'm going to give you whatever you want and we're going to hear her Lodge respond he get a little bit of a response yesterday right he didn't respond yet but but I think we were told we were we were told by Narda that he was not going to be interested in the the things of this world so do you know this is this is what we're going to hear from this little boy is really kind of like an exposition you know it is an explanation of
nature pure love
 that's what it in and it's coming in the shoe and Bob time at the conclusion of all the great huge collection of Vedic literature from the stage bi they did this to literature which ended the all these her spirituality stemming from but this is the conclusion that explains it all where this is what you owe me is about it's about becoming entirely selfless your heart melting and and being capable to love purely without any selfish motivation
 list Ivan although prolonged Mirage was only a boy when he heard the benedictions offered by Lorde to string a Dave he considered them impediments on the path devotional service does he smile that very mildly and spoke as follows this is for loud my dear Lord Supreme personality of godhead because I was born an atheistic family I'm naturally attached to material enjoyment
wasn't but he's being humble here this is you know you you're born in the certain circumstances generally take on the qualities of the people that you're with their for kindly do not tempt me lucian's right you want to give me something because I have offered some prayers I'm very much afraid of material conditions
 and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life it is for this reason that I'm taking shelter of your Lotus feet what a great attitude I am afraid of material Good Fortune is the opposite of us in the material world I'm afraid of material conditions from the goal of life and only tangle me in a cycle of suffering that
 again like vomit on his teaching us how to think
it's now next time I think of something materialistic disbursal going to come up in like wait a second train is going off the track how many times is like the train just gone way off the track and she's like it just be just some thoughts some innocent thoughts and it just makes us beer away and then next thing you know
 will a completely lost what's the verse or versus right now
 just one of the wandering senses what is that one that one's a good just one of the wandering senses and I was thinking of whatever the mind. Oh yeah I told her she up humza from attach station objects of the senses one develops attachment to them from such attachment
 one hanger anger develops from anger lusterizer molest arises one falls back down until material pool intelligence is lost
if yes then can I fix my intelligence unfortunately we don't even have intelligence we don't even understand that there isn't even a goal of life it seems like the goal is you know get our material conditions in it in their Peak Performance get what you want how to get what you want in this world how to move forward you know haven't you coach me to get what I want I'm not focused enough on my material desires and he replied saying be afraid of you focused on your spiritual desires
 that's okay I'm spiritual coaching spell you a question. So we hear that when you practice bhakti that you know that actually we're going to hear later in this can't of what we refer to as many times what is it that the Mirena put a survey in the cutest turn your baby teeth
Target off of Argonne are case you up until you are 2-0 data the devotees of Lord Ryan of Lord Vishnu that they don't have any fear
 and yeah she replied saying I'm afraid I'm afraid of what your condition how do you understand that
 the question
 when were engaged in spiritual life
 there's no more anxiety cuz you understand we are not I think a lot here at setting an example obviously I'm not going to fall down he's saying I don't tempt me like right right a lot we can't temper log but he's he's he's making the statement for us that's how I look at it you don't tempt me with material sense gratification I know strange liberated there is a direction right there is a north and there is a South I'm not going to say oh oh I'll take a little bit of this I'll try a little bit of that now don't tempt me with this stuff I want to be focused I don't want materialistic life
I'm actually afraid of it I've seen what it does to people I've seen what it does to you I saw what it did to my father I don't want that same thing for me and he sort of I feel like you started to drill into our head almost like recalibrating or tweaking in fixing the engine of the car so it's like hyperbarics now this is the high-performance thought process of its your devotees yeah yeah it's kind of like that and it's also like
 like there are things that I'm afraid of but it's not like I'm walking around in a state of fear it's just like I know they're dangerous or not going to mess with them so in that sense you're afraid but it is one thing to be like in a state where you're suffering because of a fear and it's another thing to know something is dangerous and feared in that sense right I don't you know what I'm not going to walk on that ledge you know I'm afraid of that but it's not like I'm I suffer because of that I just avoid it and it'll probably he's one said to is this
people see said your problem is you're not you know this one you're not scared enough of Maya yeah you're not afraid of my you're not afraid of the the power this illusory world that you think okay I've learned a bit about Bucky now I'm okay and it's all right if I dab a little bit in this or that it's you know I won't get caught up in it you know but
 you know the highest trying to knock on the door again and again don't say hey Maya what you want me to dabble a little present Christian as a Christian say how can how close how close can I get to sinning without sinning it's a lot doesn't even want to get close you say you're offering me anything I want but you know it don't it don't even tempt me with these things I just want to stay connected to you and I don't even want to be tempted by other ID
your happiness lies anywhere else sure we got to remember that the whole idea of stepping out off of our tracks or as a Christian say sitting it's not like you're evil because you've done something bad it's just means you're going to get a reaction for it it looks like I can use I can't use my electric drill in the water that's just like it said to keep out of water so so on the on the box when I bought it keep away from Electric things away from water so it's not like it you're evil for doing it it just is not going to make the drill work well it's unsafe it's it's not like you just made a choice there is an instruction manual with the human body and with a subtle body and to understand the spiritual body and the latest give teaching us how to live in this world make that drill effective in the most effective but can be used and there's ways to use it and there's ways
abused it so it's not too it's not to punish us is were punishing ourselves but no one taught us the rules you know cuz I'll do all works by Bustos horrible glue traps that mice get caught at do they have like some Aroma or something that attracts the mouse to it
 I never use them I don't know maybe they put a piece of cheese on it or people that's the classic mousetrap I just like she's down there I believe The Mousetrap before I kill him I put something vegan on their dog's favorite food you put it on everything
 Europeans don't even get it.
conversation the other day didn't we apples bananas you don't even need jelly
 okay Bagel toast all right let's get back into the Bible
 oatmeal
 yogurt a sneaker
 okay where are we text 30 my worshipful Lord
 because the seed of Lusty desires which is the root cause of material existence is within the core of everyone's heart you have sent me to this material world to exhibit symptoms of a devotee of devotees and saw Dennis Cinemas Perfection Southern Ocean Tsunami Sushi Perfection through the practice right you're not a failure in perfected State confuse
by this world you know Tried by the things of this world is what you think I am
 I will I will leave that up to all ready and then and then there's niches it her which means it means always that certain people come into that they can enter into the virtual reality it never confused by it just to help others come out to kind of like
 if what's-his-name Neo if Neil was like never you know confused by The Matrix and I need to pass it to it's a lot of Psych that very interesting concept people are born of the world already liberated and if you like that guess what you can become like that through son to her practice
 okay but there's that one is for otherwise oh my Lord oh Supreme instructor of the entire world
you're so kind to your devotee that you could not induce him to do something unbeneficial for him on the other hand one who desires some material benefit in exchange for devotional service cannot be a devotee in okay
 indeed he is no better than a merchant who wants profit in exchange for service who that's a good ones are very instructive benefit in exchange for the Postal Service cannot be you like you're a devotee when you walk into a grocery store like you got Price Chopper up there right and you're part of the estate Hannaford Price Chopper Hannaford in ever heard of that one before you give them money but you give them something you offer them something but you're not offering it because you love them you are friends because only because you're getting something in return
the merchant write a merchant will give you something they're going to Price Chopper they give you something but only because you're giving them something in return and that that's Mercantile kind of motive its you know it is it enters into so-called spiritual life you know what enters it it's there and all of the spiritual traditions
 in one way or another you know sometimes you see you really gross manifestations of it like some of these event event jellicles on the television right God wants you to be wealthy and I'll give you your money here you know it is at the bottom of your screen you know there's a telephone number call it right now make a pledge you know so it's like they're promising you that you're going to enjoy the things of this world if you give something two Gods give your money to God what are like that
and you do you see more refined version of that within The Vedic culture you know where it's like the idea is more like recognize that all these gifts are being given by God you know through the gods through nature and it's only right to respond to that through some through some ritual where you express your gratitude with the with the motive that I'll get more of the good things in life now prahlada saying I don't want to have anything to do I don't want you for a moment
 to think that the reason why I'm dedicating my my life and my heart to you Lord Vishnu has anything to do with you offering me something with your back it's out of love and I love is pure and so you know if someone is is coming to God with with the idea that I'll get something from God through no better than a merchant count me out that's not what I'm interested in at all
 beautiful
a servant who desires material profits from his master is certainly not a qualified servant or pure devotee similarly a master who bestows benedictions upon his servant because I'm a desire to maintain prestigious position as a master is also not a master flipping it you're flipping it be problematic Rose attached to even the prestige at the disciples are giving me that type of Fame
 I want to be too long my vehicle. My vehicle real like yeah I did all this service and I feel used yeah you were supposed to be used asking please use be engage being service
 so this is It's these kind of motive
motive to get something from God motive for Prestige motor to be recognized as a Great Devourer D motive to have followers what Moxie means purifying you just like we're talkin about
 that's that the real Beauty yesterday right the real beauty is the center light is Light Within the heart you know and we were we're kind of comparing it to like an external beauty routine where you know there's certain flaws in the skin or something like that. My hair so he knows I'm growing my hair out the scuba or are you going to go with that rather not to where you don't wear no we're not growing out and that's the problem anymore, balding, ponytail guy I think it'll come out if you just let it grow so long you don't know if your guy gets going to come out
 but yeah so just
someone may try to like remove a flaw on the skin or to like say let's purify water right likes water has something in. Put it through filters really the practice of bhakti it's like a it's a beauty internal beauty routine right it's a filter filtering out whatever interferes with the pure exchange of Love whatever mode of there that's in pure needs to be filtered out that's what we're here to do in this world in in in buckie Olga's totally focused on that you know I want my heart to become pure I want to be able to approach God and and threw got everything to be without any personal motive so that true love can actually be exchanged collage getting right to the heart of it here. The soul so bad once
 unconditional love and we're just not going to get it in a human being we're going to get it with God we should we so wanted the heart wants more than anything
and then we we put that on a human who can never often times never live up to those expectations
 so that's why we say real love in this world is you hold each others hands and you lead each other towards God hold each others hands and lead each other that's what Real Love is All My Lord I mean I'm your unmotivated servant and you are my eternal Master there is no need unmotivated Regency unconditional right same thing I'm motivated. I'm your unconditional I love you unconditionally saying I'm your unmotivated servant and you are my eternal Master there is no need of our being anything other than master and servant is like Hanuman talking right you are my master and I Am Naturally your servants we have no other relationship isn't that beautiful in in the love that's Express word insignificant and as
speaks directly against directly contrary to many interpretations of The Vedic literature it is like no you become the master you ubik you become one with God you are got a lot a note eternally you're in one position I'm in the other position and I'm good with that you know it's it's like the Leafs into the route you know what it's not that I become the route you are always the rude I am always a lie but but it's a perfect I'm nurse by you I'm perfectly satisfied it in that position
 that's beautiful oh my Lord best of the givers of benediction if you at all want to bestow a desirable benediction upon me and I pray from your lordship at within the core of my heart there be no material desires you want to give me a benediction desires so nothing will interfere with the purity of our
