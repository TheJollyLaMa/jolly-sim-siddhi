 you got a huge another today sir music from this is from Aesop you might have heard of him ASAP.
 I love people can just rock one name another man is nice Up Madonna ASAP Batman Prince
 Charo you got to be out by ASAP a crust eaten in peace
 is better than a banquet are taken
 and anxiety crust cake recipes
it crosses me like a good chunk of bread or does it just make it past the old piece of bread harder the Christian pieces better than a banquet and anxiety we've been hearing a lot about acceptance
 yeah you know what I mean a lot of it is kind of austere you know this person is lying on the ground somebody in any Endeavor for Comforts in life is that a good life you know but I think we got to we got to get to the essence of what it's all about really is that by minimizing one's so-called needs
 when's actually there also minimizing anxiety
 sure we might here like always living such an austere life that its existing it gives me anxiety just thinking about but there's just a principal
keep things simple enough so that you don't bring anxiety into your life the more that you try to kill every step just watch be observing that every step that you make for Unnecessary Comfort or unnecessary fees Pleasures unnecessary luxuries that with that thing start to get more complicated things start to get you know the anxiety starts to come out in and you don't leave space in the mind for contemplation you don't leave space for meditation you don't leave space for that spiritual and life which is so it can be so elusive
 sure can I give you a perfect practical real life example for a rock and roller roller most of us most of my friends we toured in advance and then it's certain point the bands got a little bigger and they got on Anna Wintour
and travel around America I went to one guy is laying on the wall if there's a loft in the van or something like that going to town to town maybe stay at a hotel if you got some money if you stay at somebody's house otherwise then somebody gets on a major label and so the major labels like what you know will lend you money the car too or support where they lend money to your money but they're lending it to you so you can travel now they don't understand that we went toward Advance our whole life we've figured out travel before we met the major label you know but they're like no will give you two or support and for a banner like they're basically giving up isn't giving a kid a credit card who doesn't understand that this is their money so you think in a tour bus in the first time you ever go on a tour bus of your bands like of my caliber you're like
 oh my God we each get our own bunk bed there's a driver there's a little hangout area where you can like read a book
a bowl of fruit on the table it's on it's unbelievable and you can drive for like 14 hours like through the night and wake up in your whole nother part of Europe or America and your like this is so incredible and then the next two are there like yeah well you have the option of going back to avantor and you're like no way I can never go back in a man never go back once you've tasted that luxury there's such incredible pain and going backwards so that's why you're you're beautiful point is
 get comfortable with Simplicity because once you get into luxury to cut back like that once you enjoy that it's one thing if you're a renuncia it and say okay you're going to get this right now fine I never got to take everything away fine if you can develop that middle
 I remember your Guru said to me once when he said that he was why was with your Guru and your Guru is like
big powerful Guru gets offered a lot of everything and someone challenged them in a joking way off garage you like all these you like all these opulence is and he goes he turned around and looked at the guy said I'll take nothing I'll be happy with nothing you know what I mean it was like he was serious but sort of like he played back in a joking way we got to learn to be if we can learn to be happy with nothing then you could be happy with everything and detach from everything
 read saying like opulence is bad we're saying that you got to learn to be happy with nothing or else you'll suffer don't curse the people who have stuff feel bad for them if they're attached right to be attached with the causes the pain just like you could have nothing like if you see a guy at a homeless guy pushing a cart and he's got a bunch of garbage cans close if you were to steal
thing from that cart but he would use his mind he freaked out cuz he's it's not like he's a renunciate adiposity etcetera he's actually very very attached but in the mode of ignorance and maybe has some mental illness or something but he's very attached to it so it's the attachment that causes the pain not the stuff the sense of propriety ship so that's a proprietorship yes and it's really that's that's what's causing the trouble if there's there's
 you know what the 2nd chapter the key to the way wind sounds very beautiful and I'm going to have 71 text text 71 to 271 in the bug of agita if you know the person who is giving up all desires for sense gratification from desires and was given up all sense of propriety worship
 in this void of false ego that that person alone can attain real piece
 and so that's you know this the Sanskrit that they use this
near mama
 I need my mind not mine that's the innocent you're right like even that you know a pop or running around you know who the grocery you know baskets full of you know junk is there only possessions if you if you take it they still might freak out who are you taking with mine or someone may be very wealthy and feel none of this is actually my time just a steward of all of this energy of all these resources do not for me and I think that's what you know that's what's being taught here you know is it we're about to go in to
 more directions about
 how to live life in the different rituals ones performs of the different regulations one adopts and we should always understand that there's a meaning behind these it's meant to cultivate certain mindsets that doesn't allow us to be free and write down to the essence of that is
letting go of the sensor proprietorship that it were saying that the other day minus a day hillgate ho you know my mind that's not mine I offer it you know my home my my body that's not mine I'm making an offering my home is not mine all the things that we think of is mine I send your mama you know but not just like it's some kind of artificial sense but like in a deep ontological sense
 understanding that I'm just a spark that's all I am wearing a sparkly it's an eternal Spark It's A Beautiful Spark It's a spark that's full of knowledge and Bliss by Nature eternally
 but everything that it's passing through in this world really has nothing to do with it everything that I'm passing through know that that I passed you in this world I really have no ontological connection to realize that doesn't mean that you have to behave like that all the time like you may take responsibility for
stuff in this world for people in this world for a circumstances for even so-called property in this world but you realize on a deeper level none of it's my property I have no sense of propriety ship over any of it I'm just have this little spark floating being blown to through this you know Universe taking on so many different forms ultimately I just need to get back to the real shelter to the to the spiritual and
 beautiful that's pink shirt right now I sure how it works but thank you
 alright you ready yep you seem distracted I'm a little distracted do you got your phone in your hand in there and try to be a good daughter with short she sending me like text messages of one of my chores today
Noah Noah nice kids you know what I mean yeah sure they're a little lazy today kids I really like my kids
 good good I think I feel like I missed this if you didn't go through the mean mean when you know what I was watching a movie on the plane yesterday at the window and there was like a really mean mean teenage daughter she was never mean it was nice to me
 okay
 the rain in the mess with you and that I'm driving really satisfied me to Conquest much love respect labason cease to the Supreme Lourdes neurology
let you know when Ritchie would be learning and she will be off today but the author not stopped raining about 3 if you need to talk to your brother today sticky but regular tennis in class in the Bog of Tom and my rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the heartbeat of Raticate & loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transcendental songs be established as a revocable fact when we get it done this year I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch or the knowledge of Mill Basin Sees at their Lotus feet read it from the shoe by Bob and Tom cast of seven chapter 14 text
 14 magic magic definitely another miracle yeah
 I was
what I was listening to on the plane I downloaded some videos on YouTube of a
 a people who are disciplined missing persons missing persons who have just disappeared and then we found like and it's like like they disappear in the middle night and they found other stuff like walking through the snow to the end of Lake Michigan or some like that and no apparent that there's no way they could have fallen through the ice of ice was too thick but then no Footprints and nothing and then I'll just send the guy wakes up in like Pittsfield Massachusetts or something
 what do I have to do with it but my point is that people like disappearing and then waking up somewhere else and gone for like 10 months and I've no idea where they were how they got there what happened to them
 do you suspect alien well I am suspecting
demigod or a demon abductions that's what I'm suspecting but I think it's interesting that it's a phenomenon these things happen it's not like the other one we are crazy guy who made up the story it's like a phenomenon that occurs again and again going to be a phenomenon that just occurs in the book chemicals to the brain
 no they did find evidence of this guy and there's nothing there anymore the person's Footprints 10 nothing it's as if they've even the reporters as it is as if he wanted to stay there
 Air Lift air bags for bringing that in order to the back with Tom now getting abducted the Hobart
 where are we in the Mopar
 not in the Mahabharata in the Bible
so hearing from Narda he speaking to
 fedora
 Takahashi I was like 33 cantos ago in the python man no python when was last chapter
 what is a shamrock enough day just tell us where we going to disown your own shame and I didn't even have to do anything
 yeah he's speaking to you this year he's giving the instructions about
 think about it right but you can pull together just talking to you just are always talking about the idea or ideal householder Thank You Soldiers for that that stage in life where there's some allowance for material enjoyment
 tax money
Comforts of Home children all all these things kind of them to put things in material life right but there's also the comes responsibility with that and a way of passing through that we're in you don't develop that sense a proprietorship that that's going to become really important so he's he's instructing him now and when we pick up our respects 14 you said yeah
 intelligent person should be satisfied with eating prashad food offered to the Lord that's what for Shottas or with performing the five different kinds of yoga or punch Asuna right by such activities walking give up attachment for the body and so-called proprietorship with reference to the body when one is able to do this he is firmly fixed in the position of a Mahatma what do you see yourself as the proprietor of
just like when you're not on it like when you're not well I think that that you can't you don't even realize it until you're like dying
 when your dying realize all the things I'm very attached to you know even especially that your own body we have a cont we have as as as spiritual as you and me are cuz you and I both think you know what like we have some like ego about us like we think we look like you dress very simply but you this is not you this is everybody but you think you're sitting there looking cool right I think I picked out these glasses I think these glasses look good on me I'm sure you put on those glasses look good on me look at your face you think I look good like this
 when you're dying and your face is shriveling there's a sense of like I'm losing this I'm losing
 any like attachment to my idea of
attractive beautiful or in a respectable you lose all that so we have these attachments that we don't even know we have I think sometimes we clean our closet we realize what I'm attached to that I don't even wear this thing it's been my closet for years I'm attached to these shoes that I bought I'm attached sometimes you go through photos I'm attached to my kids aren't work when they were in kindergarten when I never look at it it stays in this closet nice to bust out occasionally so so yeah there are gross and settle attachments that we have and our idea is that we shift that we become attached to Christian. We got a couple of tests to Christmas Ava to buy some of us a favor and that's how we actually get rid of the night like you have to live in a tiny home necessarily but you have to understand like this nothing's ours it's all on loan we don't get to keep anything because if your home that is it seems like yours your Gardens
the trees you planted your email your house that you pains in and worked on and created this is like a hotel room no one gets attached to a hotel room right now going to decorate your hotel room when you get go to it you understand I got to leave this even if you like your hotel tomorrow you don't go out to Ikea to get something to eat so you don't get so you have to look at it like that and sometimes it hurts cuz we the sole wants something Eternal and they want something Eternal in a temporary place isn't it frustrating we want something to eat we want a feeling of I'm going home
 and even when we come to our house we feel like I'm this is my home you know it and there's something very healthy there's somebody help me being a punk rock band cuz it was as if for years we never had a home we just like sort of bouncing around in the back of a car it's sort of prepared me for
being in a brahmacharya which you never really have a home
 and in that being said I'm a bee
 maybe we need some type of Tempe even temporary homeless person mental stability but I will say it helped me become a little detached
 but you know this this text is also speaking to kind of the regulation that you know traditionally with what householders would do
 it is that they would perform perform yagna Right light for for us but to Yogi's in the age of 11 generally the ideas that we have some altar in the home
 and at that altar it because, Central focus it kind of his many practical ways were if you're going to do it right it regulates when you wake up and when you go to sleep
he likes you in terms of keeping the place clean and it also becomes a place where offerings are made now other Vedic pads may not have had like an altar like with radha-krishna but they may have had like a fire right like a lot of the homes were built with like a central Courtyard yeah you know and then in the mail that cord you'd have this fire pit right did you build it to the nice one like bricks or stones in some way or or even Earth they kind of make it nice and dad through Mantra and through ritual that that fire kind of is is recognized as like the place to make offerings to the Lord has one chance which is full of meaning about how all this is coming from God and now I'm returning to God as an offering you offering Gigi you offering grains into that with the muncher and you do that
often do it like morning and evening you know I'm so why what is what's with this ritual what's the point the idea is I can go ahead and say yeah I don't know what anything this is all the energy of God but still that sense of propriety ship is built deep within us and so through this consistent steady day-by-day meditations really meditate to meditation that's kind of enhanced are strengthened through using external ingredients in a they can involve your eyes and your ears your senses in it but imagine that you do a meditation you say dear Lord everything that you've given to me I recognize it at all or actually belongs to you I returned it to you as an offering I seek your blessings and all that I do let you know just as I'm making this offering here I offer you my heart I offer you my life hell for my body my mind my words excetera you make that a daily ritual
 then that kind of it becomes
rooted in your awareness and you begin to see the world through that Vision now you're free right now you're free you said that very nicely thank you I am very clear and a little deeper here is talking about the food that we ride like a proud ship right down to the most basic fundamental
 sustenance right like if we had what we all have in common we all need to do we got to do it you know pretty much several times a day that's how that's the most fundamental basic way were sustained is the food so it's so this culture goes right down to that point and says okay every
 every meal that you have every everything that you it's also on the most fundamental ways that we enjoy life you know it's their food
 so think of it all when
do that daily activity don't do it saying oh I acquire this now it's mine now enjoy it actually prepare that meal again as an offering to God and then honored only after he does like as if as if it would be wrong for you to take something that's not yours and said that that near mama that's that that giving up the sense of proprietorship right down to the most fundamental activity the food that we eat is is reinforced in one's awareness through this
 type of young are sacrificed to interesting things I want to save up Rashad Rashad food offer to God so he was one story famous story about problem pods Guru you were amazing when you start to think okay we eat for shot for shot and then when you move outside the temple you might think really I thought was like everything's going to be prescribed because
Temple all the devotees are cooking the prashad for you is everything is already prashad you don't have to think twice about it but when you go when you live outside the temple if you want the Cook or something maybe I think it will offer this but I would offer best offer this
 anyway that's how I thought but then you heard the story of the famous story about a bhaktisiddhanta when he was a little boy that wasn't offered and father said did you offer that
 you said no and he said you are you took Manuel on you you took mangoes and you didn't offer to the Lord is in a first we offer everything to the Lord and he said I don't like you made this vow you're right I'm a I'm a thief and therefore of the rest of my life as a child he makes his vow I will never eat mangoes and even in his older age when the disciples offered him a mango he said no I cannot take I am an offender
 Mason
you're amazingly keep these valves like I'm an offender I think it like this
 I was also thinking so in my days of early like living outside the ashram after I lived in the ashram I thought we let you know these devotees that eat tons of Rashad may be better we just eat healthy food to see a little bit of it and who cares if a shot or not and then I read that was reading the history of Maharaja Jai Singh who was the sort of the founder of the city of Jaipur and he was a great ability of Lord Krishna and a powerful King and he had this deal where no matter where he travel all over the world he would not eat anything except krishnaprasad. And he was a king you probably eaten and I was probably going out to find restaurants are probably has people have ganick vessels silver vessels you can see these really big white in the Guinness book of records are the two biggest owl
Jaipur yeah they're silver lotus and he would carry ganga water with him wherever he went and he would only bathed with cook with and a drink Don G's water the things are better than having a ship to go to London like okay bring the lotus flower Hindus rituals he's got these cups of things of water anyway the interesting thing is people make these vows and perhaps people like extreme diets perhaps make your value only eat krishnaprasad make that vow I mean that about because when you're when that's your vow I only krishnaprasad there's a lot of times you have to skip a meal you know I'm pretty impressed with the delicious Mexican
I was so depressed with you in a sort of like who's this guy think he is loser
 and no idea how to enjoy
 embracing to use mundane rituals
 Gracias Madre Gracias Madre great vegan place we went out with a whole crowd I was with sages people for Mary's birthday start a lot I'm losing my mind what happened now we're all sitting there and everyone has refined okay okay I can't eat any of this stuff it's got garlic in it was this guy's a restaurant for Mary's birthday guava juice or something because you know I'll take a slice of avocado
a corn chip I was like I didn't like the corn changes
 first of all and fried plantains and first of all I was like eating Army corn chips give you a confessional right now in Africa is all on point don't pull out any squirrel or anything
 so I was flying to you know as I've discussed on the show I think already I was flying to California and but I got there at 3 in the afternoon for like a 5:30 flight
 on Tuesday and they kept delaying in a delay in again again again again again so in all those hours you know from 5 until 1:30 in the morning and I just was in the airport walk around sometimes I'm on the plane sometimes I'm taking us off the plane and you know you have a chance to look around is there anything here that I can eat cuz I've been on here for so long now
with stay with me right now I have a whole lot of 2nd garlic shamed on the message board right now thanks everybody don't worry I want it all the time I'm getting a Shame by a few people in The Message Board I want to join you in your shame I don't have time to take a step further I'm going to be the most the most shameful guy right now so so you know I'm looking at there's nothing here for me to eat at this place you know that the onion pakora I will get what's going on here and and so then so then I said to 130 and and then they find tell us all of the place not going to go tonight come back we're going to fight 11 tomorrow
 so I'm I'm going back into the City and you know I left you those messages you and Linda the intellect am I meant to go to California and you're not supposed to go over there I get home you know it's like 2:30 in the morning fall asleep about 3 or something like that I sleep for just a few hours I got to get up and you guys convinced me to go so I can okay
we're heading back out to the airport you know I don't have any food in the house now but now I'm doing a whole trip and I don't have any prepared food like I did for the previous day where did you eat kill steal and so and it's early in the morning but you know the one thing that I saw in that place is they have this pizza place where they're making pizza it was a serious-looking pizza I mean I was I was quite impressed you know and now he's dipping into the non ahimsa cheese so I can have this pizza yesterday but now maybe there's a need you know like now I don't have any food I hardly ate yesterday I got a whole day of travel across the country I think it's wise that you eat a little something even though
you know if I press it looking Pete's was a good well I'm about to get there but if her something this piece is too big you know maybe like I can split it with Summer somebody that you know anybody that's looking around the airport going to share a pizza exactly what I was doing a margarita with you
 then I'm sitting down and I'm like okay and I'll make an offering of whatever way I can you know this pizza but I'm offered to Christian they don't do that do that you know probably said sometimes you know we purify just by buying it you know cuz you put in the energy that you have to get it okay I will get a wholly rational justification cuz it's going to get worse so then so then so then I take my first bite of that pizza which is granite like a well-prepared pizza
I think I'm garlic it seems like it's so strong yeah I'm like you know I'm like this is disgusting you know like now what do I do do I waste the whole thing now you sit here and Injustice garlic at it look at it as medicine that sounds kind of doing I just said okay and I I do need fuel for the day and I mean if I'm saying there's no way Christian accepted this thing is so stoked and garlic and I mean that thing and I'm eating it I mean it and then I finally finished and I feel totally dissatisfied like I should have spent the money you're picturing a little roggen off on your shoulder but then then this is the real Clincher right now and then I realized it was a Kata she
 enjoy that would forget to keep that in my file cabinet and I said man
 it was
not worth is Christmas Pikachu and then went to Gracias Madre no I did get one other dish I found like the one thing that didn't have onion and garlic in it but still I felt dissatisfied eating I thought I can't I walked out of his majesty Gracias Madre like thank you mother for letting me know that I'm really not meant to eat food only if I really need to you know like sometimes you're traveling and there's no other way but it's nice to have enjoyed I appreciate your standards and I've been eating pretty much all prashad and healthy food but when I went out when I sometimes I do have to watch restaurant tonight eat there
 garlicky things and I don't shave I don't beat myself up about it either I say you know what a special night tonight. I'll hate myself another issue of Shameless
okay but I walked away still deeper convictions I don't want to be like that you know
 wake me up at 1
 so but you know what also in the bug of agita we have it right there where like the act of eating the most fundamental sustenance you know the most fundamental human activity eating you know Christmas saying that he enters into the food you know by the power of the song by the power of the Moon he becomes the life inside the vegetables that we eat and they said I become I am the fire digestion in the bodies of all living entities and I joined with the air of Life The Prana outgoing and incoming to the incoming to digest the different kinds of food so it's like everything
is meant to be meditation about the cracks cuz I cried and including how we eat what we eat how we offer what we eat have a how how we meditate when we're eating it that's really meant to always be bringing your mind back and in the sense of propriety or ship should be like Neil it's just like just like the aunt gets its food how God provides it how does the elephant get its food God provides it how do we get our food while I go out and work for it and God provides not only provides it but God also digests it for us and energizes our body with it we make it as an offering to him with genuine affection what chant what prayer do you change when you make your offering right now
 my dear Lord Krishna just as I said a bunch of deities names and their ride Harbor in the oven vihari just as you've accepted the offerings of the wives of the brahmins just as you've accepted the milk sweet to the gopis just as you've accepted the banana peels of a do a roni
and just as you accepted the breast milk a mother's soda will you please accept this offering and I'll explain what I'm offering with an l and then I'll chant and I'm Omaha bad idea and now remind me to buy you and the first one just as you've accepted
 the offering of the wives of the brahmins please do so much with so much love in their heart just as you've accepted the milk sweet to the gopis I mean, just as you've accepted the breast milk a mother your soda and just as you've accepted the banana peels of the wife of the door, she offered me the wrong item but with complete love with the wrong edible you know I think this is a big part is
how is our meditation charjabug is mentioned in the message we're too it's like when you're offering even if you're eating the krishnaprasad we should be off there some meditation that this is krishna's Mercy that's important and that thought alone. Bye is what you're doing and I love her she says better to have no going back to the Nugget better have a crust than the most tasty morsels well prepared food because it seems really feels anxiety
 when she what she eats is not prasata that English how do you accept write a story of a jury own offering the Fine Food to Krishna is the best Beastie could have offered and and Christians like me or not hungry and he's sort of like walks away from it and look what we made for you been traveling all day please take this food I made for you and Chris Rosati
Twisted in the finest food but he went to the doors house and ate the banana peels that he was lovingly in hurt Rapture of love she was throwing the bananas on the floor in the banana peels in krishna's mouth and Christian was chewing them and not protesting whatsoever you should join them and nodding and enjoying them and went to love Chris. He's the Lord of our life the lord of the demigods daily meditation you're feeding a banana peels and he just said over doing these are the sweetest banana peels I've ever eaten
 it's not even food and Krishna is appreciating the love of his devotee the principle Illustrated through a metaphor
 but a powerful one that we can adopt and we can try to deepen it and deepen it as we
 grow in our body
 you ready
Jessica bird the chapter cover here's a bird most birds they go round they sip water wherever they can find it take a bird versus I'm not interested in all that dirty water on the ground trivia there where does the ciatica bird get his water from
 give you a hint. I only drink the rain right to admit it might have to wait a very long time but it's not going to lower its standard it has a standard I accept only the rain water and its sister with his mouth wide open look towards the sky so like that that's a principle that can apply in her life in many ways like friends since what we read what we listen to who we associate with and also what we
I got that idea that within one's hard one says I will only eat what's already been offered to Krishna I don't eat anything else that's a powerful meditation too powerful conviction and was hard it's a powerful
 expression of devotion I don't want anything that you know it's kind of like you know imagine someone matching your like a mother and you cook for your family and you know your kids come home I don't need anything unless you cook it mom is like I love you so much you know like it's something like that you know your tongue and your passions are tied to Krishna gluten anyway with intermittent fasting that they're like I had you want something to eat now I don't eat till 1 we're already doing these things anyway imagine if the Restriction was Krishna Prasad yeah it's one way it's what some people say what I don't have time for Java will make maybe maybe that's your valve then you only you only you
Rashad have a baby how about bathing next time anybody gets in the water I will chant a dum dum Mantra and you can just take the most simple one is just saying gunga gunga gunga and meditating on gunga that calls ganga into the water every time you take a bath anyway want to think I'm dumb. You just have you just have to try out Conga Conga Conga three times very loud wake up the kids

 I got a email the other day for my wife you know her mother is like really into art and museums and all that kind of stuff and her current thing that she's studying is like that the painting The Last Supper you know yeah and so what you laughing about
no I didn't think about the Olympics open but go on and so so so my wife wrote mean like do you know of any kind of connection between the last supper and buck deer you know what its meaning is honestly I've know very little about it which is shameful considering that you know I was pretty shameful day Tuesday but from what I if I if I'm not mistaken I believe that the ritual of the Eucharist is to ride out of the Last Supper isn't it where he's like telling this is my body is my blood yeah and so all of you you know whenever I was a kid I would think of like going to the to church I was starving to terms like this lecture
 it really is the lectures just like kind of the opening to the ritual the whole point to the to the thing is that there's a
ritual where by ordinary bread becomes the body of God and ordinary wine becomes the blood of God and you ingest that into your body and you know and it got purified in some way through that and so that you know that the Catholics will once we go there where the priest will perform the ritual where they can
 eat and drink that which they believe has some kind of powerful spiritual potency and you don't Krishna bhakti would like no actually everything that we eat you know there's a ritual for every single thing that we eat we actually offered to God and we also feel you don't say it's the body of Krishna but we do say is not different from Krishna yeah I know it's like you're here ingesting pure spiritual Krishna energy into the Last Supper it's so so so that being said don't although it sounds crazy the fact is that people that live that way it has a powerful effect that
did don't underestimate the power of Prasad
 that's my point, leave it there you have a lot of power can I make a confession I don't think we're going to go to do this just cuz I did the garlic think if we don't want to hear to my chair. Took a am I the compassion is this me and my friend when we were younger we stole a pack of on offered communion wafers
 never told her how many are in a pack like 30 by 30 in a pack something like that 30-pack what are you doing how backstage backstage in a church what did you do with a witches what in the world were you thinking like I don't know how to check it out a pack of Wafers look like I'm stealing your mother found out about that I would like the direct the bullet train
you are an altar boy or something I was somehow connected I think could maybe you were Boy Scouts we had like access to the church can't remember how it got them but
 do you confess that in confession that I didn't depend on offered Eucharist wafer what the hell's the matter with you and our tradition we say it's okay to steal
 yeah sure if you go to a priest out of his hands and run that's okay don't steal the wine yeah please take it away minimize needs to minimize anxiety
like it's like my life airs get disturb them like I don't know where I am at Lou's like my baby do you feel better coming out of it like maybe that could laugh just needed maybe it's good for me but I do like a sick but I feel like I might leave my body
 I hope there be a little
