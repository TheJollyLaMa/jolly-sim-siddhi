 he's about to do a course what's the course called do the course first of all I'm just grateful to both of you for all the work that you're doing you're spreading Krishna Consciousness and this wisdom so powerfully across across the entire world
can I talk to people everyday and they tell me that like you guys are like a Lifeline for them and Oasis in the desert where there's nothing else around I spoke to this gentleman in New Zealand yesterday in a small town in New Zealand that he's like literally the only thing keeping him going in his life is listening to listening of the sages so he'll work you guys are doing is just so incredible and all of us everybody out here is so grateful and appreciative for what you would think so thank you for making that strong efforts all the time you always see the good thank you we're all in this together you know very nice to be in a nice father and a nice husband he's got such a great store you can go back we better get them twice on a podcast but now he's going to do a course for a hour
 what do we call them now subscribers supporting numbers putting numbers
horse called so the course is called understanding and deepening your relationship through astrology so this is a
 thinking about getting into a relationship they're in a relationship have been married for 20 years of 30-year you know anybody who's on that
 you know being in a relationship or understanding and deepening who they are in that relationship so through Universe ecology can see all the different aspects of what's going on in your life and one of the biggest
 kind of hurdles people run into our relationship problems and one of the biggest sources of strength for people to be a strong and solid relationship for their material life for all of them so this course you know is going to help people understand number one who they are who their partner is what's the things that connect the two of you together what two things happen
you will park how you can maximize
 the benefits of that relationship so you know how you can both be fully empowered and deepened in that relation how you can both be kind of a hundred percent growth in that relationship and grow at every level grow in your material life growing your emotional connection grow in your spiritual connection and gross with each other and in your relationships of course not be able to fully support each other in that Journey so this so you know after you know years and years I've seen people struggle with this this type of thing and where people are successful in it it really empowers them in their spiritual relationship with Krishna can I put a lot of people here about astrology in the air by relationships that you know I think the first thing that comes to mind to most people is
baby simplistic completely
 invalid kind of understood misunderstanding astrology recycle what's your sign or this is my son or were meant to be together we're not meant to be together sometime some real this is a real fascinating powerful agents science is Vedic astrology that that you work with can you just in a very quick way just kind of explain how this might be a more mature sophisticated kind of application of course of course so you are absolutely right you know in the modern-day you know you'll see it in the movies and if somebody walks up to somebody in a bar and say hey what's your side like this in this kind of thing but no it is not it's not that simple this is very superficial way of looking at things so you know what your astrological chart is a map of your karma it's who you are in many ways you're
nature you know that go to Passion business Negron switch can control a lot of things that happened in our life you can see and they're it manifested through the plan so you when you look at all the planetary influences in a charred you'll see that okay at this time in my life I'm going in this direction at this time in my life this is going on this is my deeper nature these are you know this is my physical nature my mental nature my spiritual nature this is what attracts me spirited this is the type of partner I'm a need in my life and you can see both the ups and downs of where that relationship, stitches itch I'm sorry I threw those so yes this is understanding our Karma at the deepest level and through that understanding our relationship with each other and our relationship with
on our potential strengths and weaknesses at any given time and of course of course I do this study where I talk about different famous people and how you know where they've gone through who are famous people who got divorced and why it happened in the good in all of that and a lot of times in relationships it's about you know there's just a bad. There's a bad year for about 6 months or something like that is going on and if we can be challenged at this point in time you can expect to be challenged that if you can be patient and tolerant during that time you will get through that okay that way that's coming and then things will be peaceful again so seeing all of that can be a just go out and look for a Capricorn or something like that it's
the Moonshine is your internal that you're the sunshine is you know where in in the modern world with the rent okay you're born in December you're a Capricorn and all of this kind of settled space completely differently when you look at things at the deepest level it means a connection between two people can be at a much deeper level and it creates a strong and solid foundation for a relationship and when you're you know when your life or your material life is solid and set it creates a very easy Journey for us to move you know strongly in our spiritual life in this course is not just like romantic love connections not about all types of our relationship types of relationships can be people who were you know with your children with your parents with your siblings with your
friends all of these relationships are included because in astrology you know Astrology Birth of all people who don't know I want to know is your astrology is in service to Krishna you know what's the purpose of astrology it's to help us understand our own Karma and then to go deeper into our relationship with Krishna it's one of the limbs of the it's in the service of Christian so it's not something that you know is separate order Boyd of update that this is very important to know that's why you want a nice astrologer like you are helping you out with it cuz you know the main thing you keep the main thing I don't we don't want to get sidetracked and send you got a real good sense of how to apply
 yes yes oh this is so any relationship you're in because once you understand yourself you understand your own, you understand why do I behave like this and what why is this happening in my life
these things are related to our own ass, which is manifested through these planets of these planets you know when were talking about Sunday WHo Saturn or Jupiter who is A or B you know these are all very great Servants of Krishna and they're here to help us you know what the you know who we talked about in the bag with the is available to krishna's Mercy to each and everyone of us to help us in our spiritual training you know Venus is there to help us show me there with Saturday we sometimes are fearful of what is actually a very amazing devotee of Lord knows she is here to help us on our spiritual journey Krishna has made it so easy you know sometimes we think that okay if not let me go on this journey and there's nothing in between but there is
 thousands and millions of devotees and spiritual energies and people there to help you
journey to bring you closer to Chris Knights actually very powerful and amazing and humbling when we when we really sit down and think about on our journey the same great spiritual entities that are present in the bottom of them or talked about in The Vedas and the products are there to help us when my original strong as your soul mix but a question about that maybe you seem like a nice chart medication for both correct Tom houses does he have enough trouble is on the whole feeling his life's purpose in the deepest way especially you know now continue
the rest of his life this focus is going to be very powerful his path both widens and becomes more focused at the same time I'm just waiting to see how this manifests as the years go out it's going to be beautiful are we compatible or uncomfortable when you guys are compatible at you you're both doing this so you're you guys are compatible at the deepest level and the and the most superficial level in every race so I like we love each other deeply we really do and
 I'd like to say that our relationship is durable you know it's like we can fight it out sometimes but we never
and I think this is really the blessings by something I think this is really the blessings of great souls in our lives that it's giving us the ability to understand even if we disagree even if it gets hot sometimes we love each other and it's never worth
 it's it's never worth walking away from this relationship you know or or saying things you notice saying it if you feel that way you're really angry with me yeah I got to go like brothers Brothers to fight sometimes I don't get mad at you you do get mad at me get frustrated time with you guys see how much you loved each other a b Barre
get frustrated with myself as well

 I love him Rachel are you ready to dive in
Ryan and the musketeer on that I'm sure even wrote them they themselves with him he has something to do before starting to shoot my bag with him which is every means a conquest when should I be respectful of base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan Hari she is super most human beings earning and just really be off today of the author not stop her you should bother Asuna Chan Baka Baka Baka Baka Baka Baka the United States by regular tenants and classes in the back of Tom and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome to the hard become eradicated and let me serve the Supreme Lord who is praised the transit nickel songs will be established as in a revocable fact I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open in my eyes are the door side of knowledge base and seize their Lotus feet reading from the stream About Time cast of seven
after 10 text 50 let's let's do a little Recon it's been awhile since we've been spending time with them directly
 yeah you know why because we had so many Q&A we had such a known and Swami 43q and a sore and then that was beautiful wonderful
 so why we're wrapping up the whole prolonged story now it's as a matter fact it's wrapped up with this is just kind of the final ball on it I suppose you could say and it's a cotton with the conversations come up the level you know upstage level up to now we're back when we're no longer provide speaking to it to Lord Vishnu is Lord Nishida Dave we have the sage Narda speaking to the king you to steer the who began this conversation 9 chapters back you know basically telling stories within stories within stories these narrators now
all right up and you just are who is arjuna's older brother is so as the as the Bob Thomas you could say is prone to do or it does constantly is designed to do work work it's a text Sharon by the time it's just the most special attack run to Raj or even have all of the Asia Davis ancient spiritual texts like the upanishads in The Vedas and the and the Mahabharata amongst all of the all of the Piranhas this is the brunt of this is the grantor Raj this is the top of the mall do you have your ass is going to express himself this is the work is on work has betrayed against the key that maybe that's the most important thing is The Bob & Tom is the key to understanding at all and when you take all of that literature that wide range of their sure that's designed to speak two different people on different platforms of understanding speaking to some people are very tight
materially speaking to some people that want to become detached but still have emotional issues that they're struggling with is it it's it's presenting truth to the mall
 and on different levels when you look at it can be confusing as to which one is the higher truth is it is it all leading and One Direction it's so easy to get confused because it's not like there's the Bible and you read the Bible and you'll be good it's like there's so many nuanced books to evolve on your spiritual journey within the Indian Canon of literature but if you have to pick one and if people do this they just got to keep themselves to the bog of a time cuz it's the essence of all established it was in these texts itself that it is this says that it is his it's the cream of the cream of all of this literature it's the the work of yassa David the Great Sage you can post them all in his maturity it was an endless it's it's mention there that it was
it was designed specifically by him to answer all these questions and so when you look at all these texts you can say well how do we understand what God is God just an energy is God a person will the last text that with that it said this the impersonal Brum Andy and personal spiritual letters non personal spiritual energy that that's Krishna himself because Krishna is the source of the impersonal Brahman he's the origin of the transcendental blues song by great saintly persons so so if you read these texts I threw punches you get these stages that are focused on this non personal aspects in Chris's behind that was the last text Sarah you know where the way people work
 we work like it's right in front of us so we think we'll Camp you this it's got to be something more hidden tell me something more secret it's this when all the way up the arduous Trek up to the Himalayas debauchery know you know anybody out there
and invite you know if there's a cave and there's a bottle in the caves like oh my God I'm all the way at the top of the hill artist Ostrom goes in the cave he needs to Sotto and give you some mystical information and he said go to print oven and read the back of a Tom we want it to be harder we wanted to be complete like a chimney the season fall in our lab you need it to be easy and it's super easy for us so it so text for dealt with the question of like is God a person or not yes God is energy and goddess person but behind the energies there's a person and that's what the last and now this text 50s like what about a we hear about all the different gods are so many of their sword Shiva there's no drama then there's Vishnu
can be confusing so this text you was with that actually there's a whole we're getting a quick story here at the very end it is kind of thrown out there that really gives us a nice perspective on how wise people move through life and it begins with this text text Christy
 exalted persons like Lord Shiva and Lord Vermont could not properly describe the truth of the Supreme personality of godhead Krishna
 may the Lord who is always worshipped as the protector of all the devotees by great Saints who observed vows of Silence meditation devotional service and renunciation be pleased with us so if we look at the last two verses
 Naruto who's more capable we haven't told people this is what I'm after 7 I just have to 10 weirdest custom right now text 49 and 50
 Naruto who is more qualified than anyone
he's called the stage amongst the demigods so when it comes to talk about the sages but when it comes to talking about demigods he is very qualified in heat and he's he's putting that you know you we consider him a Great Sage but he's a king or he's not one of these people that's wandered off into the mountains he does that eventually the end yes he does but you put but at the stage he's he thinks of himself as like a worldly man with worldly responsibilities that doesn't necessarily get the Deep insights that the renowned stage is get that don't do those that spend their their hours practicing deep meditation deserving vows of Silence living a life of renunciation he he has no respect for that lifestyle and for the people that practice it in the realization he has that humility to say if someone's going there they're likely coming there they're turning deeper inside that I have I need to hear from them
 down artist
I got it that you have faced in those kind of people I'm telling you you do in the previous when he said
 he was he was speaking about these the saintly persons who seek transcendental Bliss through their deep meditation hear he's talking about is that the Lord who's always worshipped is the protector of the devotees in the great Saints who observed vows of silence and meditation devotional service organization so he's he's framing it in in the context that you just year is capturing his attention Okay. Then take this is appreciated by deep deep thinkers and deeply spiritual practitioners and he saying
 Christian is the person behind all the energy and not only that but the other gods even though we're not even going to Shiva
 these are not ordinary beings that they can't even properly describe Krishna and now we got a very interesting story about Lord Shiva and his you could say his dependence on
even though he's so powerful even he's dependent operation my dear King you to steer long long ago and history a demon known as Maya donova expert in technical knowledge reduced the reputation of Lord Shiva
 in that situation Krishna the Supreme personality of God had saved Lord Shiva Maya Maya who was Maya donova
 Alex Alex Alex you know that the architect of the Demons ultimaya shubba so he knew all kind of tactical that he could create things she basically we could create these like mysterious fun houses or like you go to the fair to go to the haunted house at a fair that's what he would do and end and not only that but he could create entire cities that would float in the air
and that's what mystical architect anyway he was very expert technical knowledge reduce the reputation of Lord Shiva in that situation Krishna save Lord Shiva March Madness text 52
 for what reason did the demon Maya Donovan Vanquish Lord shiva's reputation and how did Lord Krishna say Lord Shiva and expand his reputation again kindly describe these incidents text message Teresa could questions and when the demigods who are always powerful by the mercy of Lord Krishna bought with the Asura the demons the asuras were defeated and therefore they took shelter of Maya donova the greatest of the Demons my dunava a great leader of the Demons prepared 3 invisible residences and gave them to the demons
 these dwellings resembled airplanes
gold silver and iron
 and they can't and uncommon paraphernalia know what that means I'm very uncommon stuff in there my dear Turtle what would it be my dear King you this year because of these three dwellings the commanders of the Demons remained invisible to the demigods. What movie is that with the invisible cloak
 Harry Potter
 do you have a cloak this is like a bug the house it's not even a house I think it's like a it's a city where I'm going to three different cities that can float in the air and are invisible and you can attack from those
 airplanes going to call him that he's floating cities very dangerous taking advantage of this opportunity the demons remembering their former end
began to Vanquish the three Worlds the upper middle and lower planetary systems
 they got an edge on them good they did right now technical technological Edge
 there I have to when the demons have begun to destroy the higher planetary systems the rulers of those planets went to Lord she surrendered to him and said dear Lord we demi-gods living in the three worlds are about to be vanquished we are your followers kindly save us the most powerful enable Lord Shiva reassure them and said you don't be afraid he then fixed at his arrows to his book and release them towards the three residences occupied by those demons they are was released by Lord Shiva. Like fiery beams emanating from the Sun globe and cover the three residential airplanes airplanes which could then no longer be seen
attack by Lord shiva's golden arrows all the demoniac inhabitants of those three dwellings lost their lives and fell down then the great Mystic Maya Dunn of a drop the demons into a nectarine well that he had created. Well
 quiz for you. Seat for you tell me what name does Lord Shiva get based on this Lila this Pastime troop Aura a r e r r e which means the killer of the three cities is Victorious over the the other three the three cities r e means
 the killer of like like more re
 I know Sanskrit
I know some of you may think I am okay so now all now the demons who they're they're playing their cities just got knocked out of the air by Lord Shiva there all beaten up to my father may be dead
 but their bodies are going to go into this nectar well nectar well I want how long you got to get them in the nectar while before they come back to life like sorry you can't you already left what if he's already took even longer will you know what maybe they pick child dies
 that's because they getting sucked back into another body everything about that let's just keep reading here that could make a lot of sense it could
 then again maybe not know that I knew a lady who had anyone that's but I shall die and then she said she felt another baby she said it was the same child I can't remember the clues you know that story mirror
 Africa
when the dead body is just the child wasn't ready to come
 then he came when the dead bodies of the Demons came in touch with the nectar their bodies became invisible to Thunderbolts endow its great strength that got up like lightning and the trade in the clouds and other bodies are stronger more power than ever never in the nectar well I want an actor well seeing Lord Shiva very much agree been disappointed the Supreme personality godhead Lord issue considered how to stop this nuisance created by my donova by the way recognize if you want to be careful what you desire because you might have to take birth as a demon to get that doctor well
 see how it works a desire that's right you don't need to pray for my children but you know what no maybe not don't pray that one wasn't successful happily married maybe maybe I'll ruin their life after happily married
don't forget about the the main thing it just be caught up in the illusion of material existence my only prayer is now is made these people be deeply connected to you that's my prayer however whatever recipe you come up with to make that happen it's a recipe isn't it you know sometimes you see someone pulling a lot of chili in in in the in the in a preparation is it was going to be some kind of spicy now there's a lot of Sweetness in there was a lot of maybe maybe it just has a little bit of spice but you need to add a lot in the size of the quantity you're making sometimes we see some pain going on in people's lives but it might be just the spice they need to get out of the material world additional additional spice to heal themselves from their there is an intoxicant in the material world that is just like this material world is great is the intoxicant of Good Karma and Good Karma
ruin your life
 that's a regular a takeaway on was going to say just
 then Lord Vermont became a cast
 Lord Vishnu a cow and at noon they enter the residences and drank all the nectar in the well so the well was the problem now Lord Shiva I thought I took him down and now the right back
 the demons could she know the answer to this is they approached Lord Vishnu he says we can take care of this end in a creative way he'll never mind just be done just like okay God kill the bad guys done but no it's stretched out in two different like episodes and I miss Lila Lila is when we fall in love with a good story we like a good Demon we like
hero we like a good you know in Christian enjoys playing that way and Kristen Joyce play until there's something about him I became aware that demons can see the cap in the cow but because of the illusion created by the energy of the Supreme personality of godhead the demons could not forbid them the greatest thing that they drink episode nectarine the well that they drank the nectar of the well I don't know if they fell into the well like if I was to see a well and saw a little cat fall in the well
 well well doesn't feel well as you've mentioned many times in their well does this so we have to have one of those stone walls around it it could just I know but it's still a well
 how do you get out of straws
 okay
could see the cat the cat and cow butt because of the illusion created by the energy of the screen person I had godhead the demon cannot forbid them so they're just sit there like going drinking all day mystically climbing out of a well well what they're doing it don't even have any gripping digits are all the actors gone now and seems like they drank a lot of air in the tower drinking the nectar and he could understand this to be the Unseen power of Providence ever have that going on where you realize you know what this is just the way it's going to happen in this hour of private you're getting right to the to the lesson I think that comes through the story
 yeah I mean we all have like summer
Panda and then all of a sudden the universe is like nope that's not going to happen and then you have to then you can frustrated you like
 near like yes okay
 what we read this and read the next verse and I think this is going to speak to what you're bringing us he spoke to the demons who were grievously lamenting here's with my done about the chief of the Demonic Architects trivia question Mara what is the who is the architect of the demigod
 it was mentioned already on the show
 Alex are going to pass the stuff
 oh Alex gets it vishwakarma
 my Donovan said that's twice Mera that's twice today
you know she's on vacation she shopping she's bronzing like what do I get for this anyway. You know it's not all about the suntan okay all right but racist chanting and listening at the same time offending both the holy name and the bog of a time at once congratulations okay but what has been destined by the Supreme Lord for oneself or others or for both oneself and others cannot be undone anywhere or by anyone whether one be a demigod a demon or human being or anyone else okay that right there is an interesting statement right
 he's he's already shown us the kind of power that he has like we have very like again if is if I said
 why does my daughter really is got some creative abilities what can you create
like he just created three cities that fly in the air and visibly can you create a no I can create make a little brick wall I can make a smoothie
 practically for us inconceivable creative power inconceivable inflam material influence but he's capable of saying you know what
 our ability to manipulate the material energy is very limited and if the higher power
 wants to undo it is going to be undone no matter how hard we try and this is kind of like a I think for many people that sounds self-defeating
 and I think in the world that we live in today are thinking is so mixed up has become so mixed up
is that if we don't like how it feels we say it can't be true well that can't be true why not because I don't like you know I'm not giving you a logical argument as to why I can't be true it can't be true because I don't like the outcome the pits and I might not even understand the outcome I don't like the feeling of the outcome so I can beat you in this is kind of where that stoicism you know there's a stellar system within the Kiana you know the knowledge of the DS Vedic literature said helps us to kind of
 learn to bypass this kind of logical malfunction
 you know because if we're going to be objective and step back and look it up our own position in this world it might be it might be psychologically comforting to say
 I can change my own destiny
as much as I want and I can create a free Sims to support that conviction I am I am free I don't see a strong I am loved I am beautiful I am abundance abundance I am now all my dreams are being fulfilled but you don't like imagine if we woke up in a very very realistic virtual reality that was being intentionally operated by somebody outside the virtual reality okay and every adjustment that we made within that virtual world was ultimately subjected to their will write they might allowed to happen or they might not allow it to happen and we just got we denied that reality it in with bravado we declared I have the power to change this world from from the higher perspective from The Wider perspective said this person is never going to get out of this trap
because they have the psychological disposition to feel the need to to feel that they have control beyond the actual scope that they do have control over what is a wiser person saying perhaps I'm caught in a trap
 right perhaps my abilities are limited and took for this is what property rights in the commentary is this the Supreme Lord is one Krishna the district at 4 okay there's a there's someone that's operating the entire that has the ability they may Grant free will but ultimately they have an ability over the reality that were existing in Christian of the Vishnu meaning this room is the one that penetrates within the virtual reality that were living in right in it it maintains it has a full control over your Christmas pants himself into vision of Tata personal expansions song said this is technical language who control everything
three different levels of Lord Vishnu they enter into the material round and round teach University entry into every living being and every atom
 Amaya Donovan said however I plant however I plan however I plan
 you you plan or the both of us plan the Lord has planned what is to happen no one's plan will be successful without his sex our plan may be successful and may not be successful but it requires the sanction of the Vishnu type of the of the the operator of the virtual reality then property rights we may make our own various plans but unless they are sanctioned by the Supreme personality got an issue they will never be successful hundreds and millions of plans are made by all kinds of living out of these but without the sanction of supreme Lord their futile this yet. Just say this may sound sell the painting it's not it's actually self-empowering is understanding the reality in which we are
and then learning how to best operate with that understanding
 when I was younger
