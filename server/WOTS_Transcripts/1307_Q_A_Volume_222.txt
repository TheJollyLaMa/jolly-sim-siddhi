 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your host and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York City without us welcome to everybody Welcome to accumulate accumulate there's a day that people right in their questions send them to Miss Mara at wisdom of the ages one way to gmail.com and we try our best to answer them and yeah if you're listening from Rich Roll got a lot of people that came over from the rich roll podcast I did and also from tin foil hat podcast yeah so welcome welcome to the show everybody this is our daily study of yoga if you hear about yoga some
you just think it's up and down and breathe and jump back jump forward his other facets of yo that we talked about yoga philosophy how to connect the soul that's the self is a mysterious thing is so some mysterious whatever keeps this machine tiken that energy they call the soul is unchangeable commutable its eternal
 and it doesn't die they say when the body dies matter fact I don't know if you saw that thing I sent you the stupid and I haven't watched it yet what about about children remember remembering past lives I didn't see that oh yeah children remembering past lives there and it always fascinates you what it's like when it comes to it in the Washington Post it's fascinating getting on all my crazy websites in that I go to is not so fascinated by The Washington Post looks like it's real
 anyway
yeah well if you just you don't scroll through the comments because a lot of people like this is I don't know non-sense and then other people like my daughter and all this time I thought of what you was doing and saying all this stuff about how she was my mother and you know if it was yesterday that we're talkin about the Brian Cox and his interview on The Joe Rogan show and yeah you know how he hears an important point he came out and said you know they talked about the Sol and Joe Rogan said you know people many people believe that within the body you know when the engagement of the body there's this Divine energy you know conscious energy and then and then Brian Cox can forward and said I can tell you for damn sure that it's physical bright as a purely physical phenomena tell you for damn sure aren't even in the back off a little bit you know he couldn't they said we would have to be very very subtle like yes and we're like the exactly but here's the point if you're assigned to
if you're a researcher
 and you approach your research with that kind of conviction already I can tell you for damn sure
 then how is that going to affect your work you're at your research what will you filter out what evidence will you filter out because you've become you condition your self today to can't be that it can't be true so so you begin to throw out evidence that you would otherwise accept and they call that a knowledge filter and it's in that saddle that affects us more than we think and it even you because your scientist you have a PhD in you've got fun and doesn't mean that you're immune to that
 it is subtle and it's I like the you keep it very simple whatever animates matter and then and then we see that also in animals and trees and plants and they said right down to the Earth itself so
honest and you know it was weird because it wasn't explained well when I grew up in a Catholic Family so that you have a soul is so they make it seem like it's what I asked for the Friendly Ghost or something worse like this it looks just like you but it's inside you that it comes out of you anytime it was they made it into a television show or something that had a soul or a movie was like this ghost like thing that floats away actually the ghost or the subtle body isn't even the salt and animates the subtle body as well that makes the mine in the eagle and the intelligence so that thing that sort of you notes away is it you either do you end up watching that clip because he could start to talk about ghosts and cocks oh no I didn't he gives a very weak argument about disrespectful but he says what would people want to believe in ghosts in the book to go so it looks like them right when it will not necessarily and then anybody use that the show's to that means that there's a connection between matter and this and that
it didn't even make sense what he said it and that's my point here the guy that's obvious he's got a high IQ right and it seems like a nice enough guy and all that but if you got these convictions are ready you can end up putting a weak argument sit and you know what kind of effect and research you know you but you did put this article in the wash cuz I'm not saying where though I can't say how well researched it was what kind of rigor they put those testimonies through but you know some people going to do some people may have a knee-jerk reaction this is nonsense will hold it can you take a guide what's the guys name be in Stevenson who did so much research and give so much detail as well as it's still all just you know when you when you do hundreds and hundreds of interviews and you you know you put it through the kind of rigor that's necessary for a true researcher to do and in the end there's no answer except
 well it seems to be Supernatural no key
that ain't throwed out if there's nothing Supernatural we should be able to figure out everything that's that's that's that assumption can't be proven empirically the dog can hear at things I can hear is that means that's that's at segue into our first question dog question and no answer
 okay is that how you see it that's how I saw that kind of
 yeah we have a back to your cover your meetings at 9:30 of 11:00 and 12:30 eastern time and there's no show tomorrow but will be back on at 7 a.m. next week 7 a.m.

 alright alright so let's Dive Right into this question is from she from Miami Miami crew of the whole pack of people from Miami asking this question perhaps she's a long time other and by the way you know I was asked to give a little presentation to like an iskcon Gathering last weekend online that you know
spoke with that was massages for 15 minutes and they took some questions and where were they from there all over the country in North America and someone from Philadelphia said there's 15 people that are was in the sages listeners at that like from through was in the sages they got into just about to and they all spent a lot of time at the Philadelphia Temple scroll over there if we got to go and visit Miami crew parently to Miami Cruise Philly crew cruise around I'm at the San Francisco crew we got to San Francisco question today other than ever going to tell me to La crew the LA crude away ratha yatra and then we're going to be there
 okay let's go into this okay this is from Karen franchi here's what you says Hunter crew a very heartfelt an enormous thank you to each of you dear Souls my family and I greatly appreciate your ongoing service
the production of the podcast I was introduced to bhakti as a teenager have been a lifelong Yogi wisdom of the sages came into my life a few years ago it is immensely help me get back to the reading daily and I tell you what the association it's hard to read daily you could just say it like in there shortly this stuff you get lazy cat lazy we get distracted by a very interesting things right things urgent but not important. It helped me immensely get back into reading visiting temples daily chanting daily and sharing with my children friends and family
 I feel as many people these days is a strong conviction that I am walking daily through the illusion of Maya lie to this is an illegal and that Krishna
why are navigating the simulation together like to Magic Mountain Fire video game that's the next level of understanding right the first one is this world is an illusory virtual reality test ya like that one is krishna's behind it all and he's in my heart I'm going through it with him that's like yeah like when you get it when you were walking in the mall or downtown you like this is my this is my this is Maya meaning this used to make me attract me but now I know there's there's no big payoff here unless you said track me there's no payoff there and that's in a level level 1 vedantam but level 2 she's talking about the births like all but there's a person behind all the illusion he's with me all the time Christian quotes at the confidential knowledge she's got it yeah
 we have a beautiful sweet golden retriever golden I have a question about my family dogs she said oh I have a question about my family dog we had beautiful sweet
the retriever golden retrievers are beautiful dogs aren't they are being there I'm as I call ya ya noodles but I'm getting like stump awarded by the kids rescue rescue rescue right now so right whatever dog needs your help in the most you take that. I already have a dog so maybe you should rescue how about that says who saved who rescue it and bring it to you or I think you need one of those service dogs personally think I'm blind.
 You said that recognizes that a problem
all right come on up squirrel with me this he has been a witness to all
 he has been a great friend at the devoted member of our family he has moved to other countries with us has been a witness to all the ongoing events in our lives
 he is our little love sponge to him she's a dog person we can tell he's recently become very ill we have tried all the modern medicine options now he is solely with a holistic naturopathic doctor people have been asking me if I'm going if you would ask me if I'm going to put him quote with him down it's such a horrible way to put it to
 release him
 anyway this is come on because he has lost his ability to see and he is slowing down I feel I'm just happy each morning that he wakes up
daddy still has a very strong appetite and is excited when people come over or he will hurry to the kitchen when we are cooking I'm struggling with the painful attachment we are sitting and chanting with him regularly the fortunate dog as we are going through this process together we are all turning our Focus to Krishna I find it painful to realize we are not our bodies as I realized my time with my dear innocent little friend is coming to an end soon here's my question how do I find a Krishna conscious way to prepare my family pet and the environment for his death how do I know when is the right time for euthanasia or do I allow him to fade out naturally
 if any of you haven't had any experience with this I would love to hear more about it thank you for your service from our whole family over there all the time on the farm
you know when you got a lot of animals they died then it looks shorter lives than that yeah I'm do tortoises live longer one of these things especially with humans it's like I don't even know what I want like it down sometimes because it's like it's like sometimes we we've created so many ways to artificially keep the keep the soul in the body when it should have died years ago you know what I mean we try to do that yeah you just burn out all the Family Savings and get birds out through all the Family Savings and you're not even with the person anymore they're just bedridden or there they should have did that part of me feels like do I really want to exist in such a state where my heart is beating but I'm going are you going to are you giving me the pull the plug permission right now or I'm giving you the pull the plug permission
make sure I'm going to die so there's no way of you getting any better I broke his finger and we take it to your car or maybe you're not fully dead we take it to the funeral pyre and what happens anyway I like what she's getting into how to make this more Krishna conscious home for the dogs out like they are the things of the dog in the dogs a shot and if you still want my dog doesn't eat vegetarian food but he'll eat it right dog would eat my shoe if I put peanut butter on it and yeah you know it's a special special time and the I think the ideal thing is the dog dies naturally but I have to think about that myself and I was just sharing it over there with trying to talk me talk to me yesterday about something important I was your
talking about what am I going to do with Gus in my own world because you have a dog that's getting very old a better thing for it but you know these my dog to the joints go really bad he can he can can't barely get up on the couch anymore and he's just like he can't go for a walk anymore and it's a little sad so I like the idea of a very Krishna conscious environment who knows this could be the like the last birth of this dog with devotee with a devoted family this enchanting idea right now they're not ordinary yeah I was going to pick up there with you we got a lot actually get a lot of these questions you don't know who I think once or twice or taken before cuz we don't want to be the person that's going to say you know how do I know when it's time to put it to I'm not going to I'm not giving a good thing to do or not and you know sometimes shastra like the sacred texts they don't always
play like a like a manual in the sense that you know they provide explicit step-by-step instructions about what to do in any given situation more commonly dildo give instructions in terms of principles and values and so I think the principal lyrics compassion right am I doing it because I just don't feel like taking care of the animal am I doing it because the animal suffering so intensely that it would be better off you know if it if we're to believe you know right away or sooner yeah that that's something I think you have to read these texts and try to embody them as much as possible and then really think about it pray about it you make that decision yourself
 but as you Serenity I think you doing a great service here for the two Hawk you know in terms of the atmosphere
and of course when we think of dogs and devotees what would we always think of
 dogs and devotees dogs antibodies dogs and devotees
 I'll let you talk in the dog yeah I will hook it but who is the devotee
 commencing most importantly it's like such an important deep philosophical text right it's kind of like it's it's practically serves as like the most important text in our lineage shaken up like to go to both Dory the dogs are at an end within that very important text it puts a story about this devotee and this dog and there was a devotee name shipping on the saying you lived in Bengal I wear something we know where Lotte Tanya was from and where all his followers do you know most of his followers region with fun and they used to make a a yearly pilgrimage
the Juggernaut toy which means you have to walk that walk for like weeks it's like a pilgrimage me walking from upstate New York till maybe for junior and so so yeah you have to walk for weeks I think to get there and and there was one devotee and this is a special thing when do Roadies do the something to his Embrace is like like my friend Tara in my poor right like he lives in that beautiful little devotional neighborhood and people come to him all the time just with practical life considerations you know I'm I'm leaving my apartment and I need to rent it out and you know what to do or I have this issue or that issue can you help me he's always just serving them trying to help them you know and that's some some devotees really Embrace Pat and
walking with a group of hundreds of people that is so many practical considerations that need to be cared for and he just said I'm going to own that and that's a real special way to practice but it's a real way to get into the Heart of Christmas by a servant krishna's devotee so in that mood he's taking this group of hundreds of people in they founded this one dog stray dog just started following them along and there's filing them everyday and it in shipping on the same begin to think I guess I have to take care of the dog to a responsible now I got to make sure there's food at the make sure you know has a decent place to sleep and then he he on that responsibility one day the dog was around and he's running you know what he would he would there they're crossing the river and they both said I was having first. OK Google ask for all the people and they said that Bob pay toll for the dog so he really cared for and then one day they
he looks around the dog wasn't there and he was kind of upset with everyone that comes know nobody else seem to be as focused I suppose I think it's a bit like come on everybody let's be so he searched and searched everybody he said everybody searching nobody was able to find that dog in whose broken he was broken and he was but he was really broken and end when they got to where they were going to shoot to Jenna Poirier they came into the presence of sujay Tanya they're the ones that talked with Doug was feeding it chapatis no coconut was the hottest day I was putting myself in there was a peanut butter on that your party and ya'll go Channing
 eat the booty go
 which dogs do to make that they can do that kind of talk some
and so on and then it died and it went back to the spiritual world I talk now there's a commentary in the telling of that story that I thought I'd reach that's great I want to hear that this morning so this was the part where they started looking for the dog it was missing it said in the morning they look for the dog but it could not be found anywhere all the bike shop is worst honest I think they're especially astonished with the the level of Shivan understands concern yeah yeah and okay so here's the commentary on this should have done the same as attachment to the dog was a great Boon for that animal
 the dog appeared to have been a street dog
 since it naturally began to follow shooting on the sand while he was going to Chuckanut poori with his party he accepted it into his party and maintained it in the same way he was maintaining the other devotees it appears that although on one occasion the dog dog was not a
to board a boat should have the same did not leave the dog behind the paid more money just to induce The Boatman to take the dog across the river then when the servant forgot to feed the dog in the dog disappeared from Dundas and became very anxious and send ten men to find it okay you go that way you go that way we're going to find this dog so that's it appears that somehow or other she would understand it become attached
 to the dog here we have a devotee of should take Tanya out of extremely high level of perfection to do what you know he was not just an ordinary devoted he was a personal associative Tanya and you know what highest level devotee he had become property losses were attached to the dog you really cared for it he really had compassion for your head love for it as will be evident from the following versus the dog
got the mercy if she tell you my Hopper Boo and was immediately promoted to buy Clinton became an eternal devotee so in that life and that dog body you know that was his last birthday Material World Shield epoxy been no talk or has therefore song to me Tata khuda Tu Mera khuda Jane amore
 which he says he does offer of associate sprayer want to know tacos. He does offers to become a dog of the Bison of the right let me become of the dog at the bike shop in my next birthday is praying like that there are many other instances in which a pet animal of a vaishnava was delivered back home to buy come to local back to that it is many years is it is rather interesting such as the benefit of somehow or other becoming a favorite of a vaishnava
 should have bought you know about 70 talk quora has also sung kitajima High boo York
to adasi to your Dasa there is no harm in taking birth again and again
 our only desire should be to take birth under the care of a vaishnava fortunately we had the Apophis has fortunately we had himself or chili we had the opportunity to be born in violation of a father who took care of it very nicely he prayed to she might be right around you that in the future we would become a servant of the Eternal console to Sri Krishna some the somehow or other we are now engaged in that service we may conclude that even as dogs we must take the shelter of a vaishnava the benefit will be the same as that which a cruise to an advanced devotee under advice of his care
 wow that's so it sounds like Karen is doing a great job keep up the kirtan re Baba town to your dog give it some Prasad and I especially when it's passing away if you can place a time maybe teach you how to play cartels
God's you respond to your morning Puja he just seems like to come over and plopped himself down in their prayers and seems to appreciate the darshan and and you know he knows something something healthy and spiritual and wonderful is going on beautiful is going on there I think my strength is good thing oh Mike Bayer said our dog Kai passed away last year listening to Proud pie Channing and wearing Tulsi beads nice and is nice to talk you know what I would
 I don't know if they I don't know if that's all right don't see with material Vision it's a spiritual when it dies I would definitely do it I don't know if like normally was living a lie bring all over
my old cat yashoda with Tulsi beads maybe just put a couple beats on the dog collar
 maybe I'll stay with you you pray internally and see what you come up with okay saying it's so horrible a dog I'm very proud I'll give you know I'm a cat person you said yourself you're not a cat person or a cat person
 I will you know Kim got bit by dog the other day
 Kim Coppola Coppola from Rhode Island are at Lovelace at 2 she's a regular Zoomer
 sometimes even a good dog if it's been mistreated or something new respond that way yeah I think it was a little feral
 that's why I'm a cat person okay next question alrighty next is from
Victoria Johnny I remember Victoria from the bhakti center now she's on San Francisco with that have been at the
 Castro room Conrad run
 yeah we're booked the ssf I can't remember I have a practical chanting question chanting and breathing properly is hard for me and initiated divorce of chanting breathing somehow chanting japa going along you doing you're one of those people like to breathe through their nose
 and they charged if you're doing two hours of chanting you doing two hours of potentially breathing through your mouth which is can be a problem my brother. Same problem myself getting the reason they haven't you do it just like you just start you just do everything through the mouth
2 hours that you're committing to pour wreathing in one sense so she sang I'm a practical Channel question and then initiated ability who's also in advance to bode ice arena in front of your instructor once told me his method but I'm sure I'm not sure if it's Bonafide so I want to check with you by devotional activities in the minds while breathing in and then she acting 3 mantras out loud while exhaling I do this all the time we got to do this one all the time yeah because I like breathing through the nose that exact length of mouth on your exhales not so bad but breathing in through the nose is important so I do that all the time inhaling through the mud the one the one chat again say it again
 you're inhaling the maha-mantra as you're inhaling through the nose so you saying silently
only in your mind okay and then you change it out loud on the exhale Factory next 3 months she has two or three I love this personally because I can concentrate on the Munch or better if I wait to breathe in before chanting another Mantra the flow of chanted becomes Disturbed I know we play significant importance and actually saying the Mantra out loud
 which is why I wanted to confirm this is this a legitimate way to chant thank you so much horsepower you serving Victoria Johnny I think I think more important than saying out loud it's just hearing it and you can hear obviously we hear thoughts in the mind all day long I thoughts in her mind we here on a regular basis I hear voices or even a deaf person can hear the Holy Name sure sure so I vote Bonafide if you're if you want these people to care about breathing through your
you wouldn't try to sometimes you like to play around with our job at 2 as long as you'd like to chat loud sometimes like a channel through the mail since I was with Janet pretty softly marriage has really soft and yeah you just have to know what works for you sometimes if I just chance in my mind I'll become distracted by my mind is sometimes a little bit audible is helpful for me
 but I do like the smell that she's talking about in general show profit instructed us to chant allowed
 and hear the name right in one sense it's as simple as that but we do hear from other text that
 chanting can be silent within the mind
 and I think you'll find that in our adoption Tom minis that's the method spoken up but you eat what's in that accounted for dinner and there's a similarity in this question last question right I don't have a text that I'm going to open up like a manual and tell you that the you know what
inhale and silently chant for one Mantra and exhale for three months is not known if I believed to have Excel for two months is here and I was like I don't have any anything specific to off you have General things to offer you an in this the principles has become important she said here
 she said I know that will replace she said I know we play significant importance and actually saying the Munch out loud why why do we play significant points on that so that we can better bring the mine to the Mantra that's the reason and so when she wrote about this meth and she says I love this personally why because I can concentrate on the Mantra better okay that's the principle is it not so that we could we want to concentrate and we want to bring the mind and it is orbit in that name better and so that's that's the principal whatever
that principle is what we're trying to do so like that we'll find we'll find you know in general we want to sit when we chant or I'd like that's the same car if you go to all kinds of yoga texts are going to tell you stay with your spine up straight you know it's it's a Suffolk way to sit it's the way that it the energies flow to the body if it's better for being alert and concentrated but some people have trouble doing that it's so painful for me to do that it's so uncomfortable for me to sit that way that actually drives my mind away from the Mantra and into this feeling in my body all right then I just read then we adjusted because the principal we want to serve the principle the principle is how to get my mind more to it so it sounds to me like Victoria is practicing something that's helping her keep her mind concentrated on the manttra then we accepted this is our this Rupa goswami says in the body
Karina Mata Krishna the base yet that somehow or other bring your mind to Krishna accept whatever is favorable if it if there's something that's
 making it more difficult for you to bring your Chris minor Christian we rejected if there's something that's making it easier to bring the mind if we accept it and that is always going to be details how we apply those principles and so we just lean into the principles
 God bless you if you would have said I really love this because
 I feel like some pranic thing going on in me or I really let you know she could have give no job is about bringing your mind to that to that name and concentration and prayer will naturally well that's why we do it we don't do it for other you know you know what I'm say you are you at work and I would have been like no because it helps me breathe that could be true but if it helps you breathe at the cost
in the Holy Name That's right so the point of the activities to bring the mine to the Munch absorbent deeply in the night shift and if that's why you're doing it and if it's helping you do that then except
 that being said mayor about some tape on my mouth while I sleep and yeah yeah how's that working yet my mustache rapper what do they call it like a pony and Anna all right this is from into the gates I love how in Discord everyone got some crazy into the gates heavy metal name is my heavy metal name into the gates
 this from the Discord thread I was just reading the bhagavad-gita 434 famous person
you know it
 and it talks about learning through spiritual Master by rendering service so you can gain knowledge in advance in your spiritual life to have a little Corona here to this morning
 I don't know we have some we don't we don't have it on speaker do you speak or being we don't have it on that we got from his mom
 cuz I know I tried
 navigate to 434 want you quoted just try to learn the truth
 by approaching a sphere to master choir from them submissively or under service sent to them
 search realize Souls can impart knowledge because they've seen the truth or less that's when it's okay
for several I'm sure this has been asked a thousand times but how does one go about this right when the nearest Temple to offer services almost 2 hours away is there a way to do that from afar of course I've read and I'm continuing to read through the Prop Hunts books and consider him my spiritual Master as he has guided me this far but how would I render service the way I read and interpret that verse is physically present spiritual Master maybe not all there is
 there is some
 substantiality about ya rendering service to a person present but
 you guys can hear that they're doing some repairs on my roof yourself and then unmute yourself
we can either serve personally or we can serve at a distance Siri at a distance is also here practicing bhakti hearing enchanting reading issue about what time is also serving the guru Channel your job is also serving the guru and M end and following the practice of bhakti we're actually were becoming genuinely humble we're thinking about serving others more than ourselves and then we create a vessel we are even mystical even though the guru's may not be physically present with us mystically we're getting information put into our hearts through that through the readings to the purports and you'll find yourself advancing it's nice to serve the devotees devotees don't like to be alone because they want to serve other devotees so if you have other devotees around you
 you can render service to them and in serving devotees that is also serving the guru as well and of course if you have a
 something
but if you have that
 senior devotees in your like life also people are your instructors render service to that and that's also serving Guru cuz your instructors maybe they don't give you your initiation but they did give you booked it and therefore the run your service that was like the greatest thing we can offer
 cuz if you want to abolish, you know it's it is so important question yet it has been asked many times cuz it's a reality and I'll tell you something right this makes me I have a message for the international Society for Krishna Consciousness what we we have all kind of ideas that are based on like a model that existed 40 years ago and that was like everybody comes to body through these temples right it's not like that you know and so like
lot of the the guidance in the guidelines and showing they have to do with temples like you know if you were going to be initiated by a guru you need to get permission from the temple president what I never even go to any of these embassies that are in certain cities or towns you know how to draw the country so people are going to find Buck tea online they're going to find it by bumping into some of them to find it by picking up a book
 and they're not going to be around a temple or they may even be around a place where there is a temple and not feel the sense of communion you know that they're looking for there and we get that message sometimes too like I like practicing bhakti I just don't jive with the temple that that's near me that's the reality and therefore we need to find way
two again bring in the principles right find what's needed in very important aspect of body practices
 connection with the guru hearing from the ghost in the Crow River Phoenix
 so here's here's a very sincere person
 and
 take me at the dentist
 I hope not
 quick
 quiet
 you're muted I know cuz it's really loud right now
 sanguine points was tuba
 okay I can try
so we have to find a way to to facilitate this person's practice right and one was going to be online but you know this connection between the Gru and the disciple is it's what it is we're saying that Krishna himself comes through right through the guru to the disciple his message how to connect to his God comes through it comes to many different channels in any of those channels is considered glue right when you're able to connect in and get Divi again I get transcendental understanding present knowledge even inanimate objects
 technically are referred to as Guru within the sacred texts if someone has the ability to receive transito knowledge through it and so that's it's super important it is the way that receipt Transit allows you to see the way that we connect with Krishna
then when the disciple when the Seeker when the secret
 Hennessey car really wants it then then
 Krishna finds a way
 and I'm sorry that's okay
 all right if maybe I can try maybe you can continue what I'm saying is maybe catch on
 I don't know if I can maybe not I was saying is can I could talk like this is It's really so bad it's got just do it no other option okay so when they do matter what obstacles are in the way if the Seeker really wants it Krishna will send it and but you have to be open you may be receiving it online that maybe the way that you most substantial yet it also be
travel for be willing to seek it out you know if you find that their people online that you are rooted who's message really is changing your life since you can seek them out in person to you know you can find out where they where they're based and spend time with them, said you know it's Express to them in the mood that it is siple speaks to group your words have touched my heart you know the difference. Me and bhakti they're there helping me understand who I am and what this life is meant for can I comment and and learn from you and serve you you know I I could I you know I have a job in a full-time but is there an opportunity where I could take time off and come and meet you in person reach out like that don't be don't be shy to you know
 I think it's an isolated so you can meet right now so I'll talk if you're isolated is and and I told people this to have been really enthusiastic about Krishna Consciousness but don't Jive
local temple is become the temple make your home the temple invite people that invite people that you think our interest in Baki invite your friends over and read with them come have them make your home the temple and don't use an excuse why lie these devotees I don't get along with them or okay find make your own Temple and then you can invite these people to come that looking say Hey you know we got 10 people together every Saturday night could you call him and well if you get there someone there that inspires you may be the whole Temple doesn't spiral the world and end in if you say every Saturday night we bring 10 people together and we're very inspired by you would you please, pay for your transportation now you say Temple then just make your own Temple speaking exactly to that I say
 anyway that's the point
I've seen people bail also be like well I don't drive with the temple and then they just drift away and do their own thing you know if you've got problems with an institution guess what don't complain about it make it better and you can make it better yourself and and and of course as soon as you start taking that responsibility you'll find like wow this is harder than I thought and you'll stop complaining even more cuz you realized your ear actually tearing a globe in your head so it's important and nowadays if you want to prove something just do it it's really easy to do it yourself and that way it gets rid of the complaining and then you could make it better and sometimes things need a little refreshing
 all right
 that is all
 I was trying to say
 do your play reggae.
is that the day may not connect with the temple
 but they may connect with an individual that's a distance sure so if you do exactly what you're saying kind of create your own little scene where you have a mood that goes to relay to then that can be a way to draw that person to come visit you and do you have the chance to meet them personally and serve them that deck for someone that really makes it their life to teach back to you if you if you reach out to them and say you inspire me and it was a group of us and they see that you are actually reaching out in creating a scene it's a great place for that person if they are I'll come up somehow yeah I think we should stop at Shell right now even though it's a little bit more time I just think it's
