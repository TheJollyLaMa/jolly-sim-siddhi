Do you got a nugget for you Mara do you want me to read this cuz this is what we read a little bit from this it's a New York Times article actually
 it was published it was written by Ellen Barry and Cecilia King it was published on June 17th
 and the headline is
and this is important we talk about this stuff all the time on the show
 Surgeon General doing what the Surgeon General actually is right now it's it's like a position like Indra important doctor in censoring like this
 Vivek mortal named American look up what I was always wondering what it was in the old days but General the surgeons agree know that was about a surgeon's that a bunch of Surgeons got together had a committee Surgeon General President appoints the Surgeon General who has like the top person when it comes to the nation's health or some like that operational head of the United States Public Health Service commissioned Corps and nuts the leading spokesperson on matters of Public Health and the federal government of the United States federal government and who is fauci
I forget it wasn't the Surgeon General General calls for warning labels on social media platforms this stuff is dangerous people we've been saying it right now the Surgeon General saying it is this dangerous what we're doing now no social media platforms podcasting
 the podcast is safe with your podcast to dr. Vivek Morty he's a Surgeon General said that he would urge Congress to require a warning that social media can use that to that social media use can harm teenagers mental health but I can't once you once you get out of your teens it's completely fine no it's just as dangerous as well maybe not just will probably not in those impressionable years you probably really screws with you in the Playtex just like trauma
you're 25 traumas one thing but if your 5 trauma as a whole nother thing you know so I'm sure the warning is for youth but it'll if it affects everybody will it's just like cigarettes and stuff like that this warnings for the snap would like it's illegal to sell them two children you know and B okay the US Surgeon General dr. Vivek Morty announced on Monday that he would push for a warning label on social media platforms advising parents that using the platforms might damage adolescent Mental Health
 warning labels like those that appear on tobacco and alcohol products are one of the most powerful tools available to the nation's top health official but doctor Morty cannot unilaterally require them the action requires approval by Congress The Proposal Builds on several years of escalating warnings from the Surgeon General in May in a May 2023 advisory he recommended that parents immediately
 let's see if you do this
the parents immediately set limits on phone use to set limits on phone use you can't because you're here more than your kids doing is crawling on my way to S is it is it is it is it social media or just having a phone well it's not everything on the phone is social medium know but anyway this is the way the things work when did the parents of Millie set limits on phone use and urged Congress to swiftly develop health and safety standards for technology platforms he also called on tech companies and good luck with this to make changes to share internal data on the health impact of the products to allow independent safety Audits and restrict features like push notifications auto play an infinite scroll what is infinite scroll you don't know that that's me sitting in the bathroom scrolling infinitely which he says pray on developing
brains and contribute to excessive use in an interview Dr Morty said that he had been deeply frustrated by the platforms reluctance to do so I don't sit Navy quote quote there's a quote from I don't think we can solely rely on the hope that the platforms can fix this problem on their own he said they had 20 years he said that he is quite optimistic that legislators will put forward a bill requiring a warning label what she envisions would appear regularly on screens when people use social media sites you think that affects people do you think anyone who wants to smoke a cigarette is going well I'm okay with that right now past warning labels have had significant effects on Behavior
 in 1965 after a landmark report from the Surgeon General Congress voted to require all cigarette packages distributed in the United States to carry a warning that
using the product may be hazardous to your house that's began a 50-year decline in smoking when the warning labels first appeared around 42% of us adults were daily cigarette smokers
 42% by 2021 that portion has dropped to
 what do you think
 you know what I'm just going to get your I'm going to give the Surgeon General all the credit for that it was at 42% before ready to how about that 11.5 11.5 I don't think the surgery Jay I'm not going to give it to her General that much credit do they have to do what they do in India all I'm saying there's many many factors are people stop smoking in America so maybe that had a lot to do with the warning labels
 that's one crazy poop peculiar Factor B
that not necessarily crazy people got in to help more they are no one no one to the gym in the 70s now people go to the gym Pilates fast and just look at the look in your eye that people smoke like the people smoke like Chimneys in Europe and they don't have the warning labels there and they don't do you got to be like Indian India put pictures of people's mouths like being totally destroyed by a disease right so does Europe okay that's not working I'm not going to give any credit to the Surgeon General slowdown why you getting all worked up here on your cable
equation OK Google acts so downright it's the world's not out to get you just like to see the surgeon general's internet history himself so he's federal government OK Google
 Betsy
 here it says
 in an essay published in the New York Times opinion section on Monday dr. Murphy pointed excessive intake of nature is metal might harm your mental health that we know that is not true Morty pointed to research showing that teens who spent more than three hours a day on social media they significantly higher risk of mental health problems and that
6% of adolescents so that social media made them feel worse about their bodies you STS or spending an average of how many hours per day on social media platforms like YouTube tic toc an Instagram
 what do you think how many hours per day I mean probably 6
 that 4.8 but I put my kids they did get a phone till they were 16 that was a rule my ten-year-old slipped under the rail because the family was shaky but that he got a little he was he was a little feral but but but he doesn't have social media but I mean you guys YouTube is YouTube social media or maybe I will but I think everybody else does I think it used in productive way like he's completely like something entertainment like anything's to make entertaining videos does it does he do mice grow
 no he just plays video games
he's self-regulated Dad I think it I think I'm going to the point of a dictamnus now I'm going to scan and fill say that maybe that's because you said such a good example right now I'm starting a Mexican talk to me is a spiritualist dating me a list of who has Mark dr. Murthy said that he had repeatedly heard from young people who can't get off the platform offering find that ours had passed despite their intention to just check their feets the platforms are designed to maximize how much time we all spent on them he said sure I just one thing to do that as into an adult and another thing to a child whose impulse control is still developing
brain is at a sensitive phase of development talk to the Box Recovery Group adults don't do well with well with self-control and yeah you know I just rather than you don't debate the details about how effective warning labels are that's that's really not why I brought this article up but it's a show that actually you know what we take and things that are addictive of that make us depressed well that's true that we've got our time in life is ticking away slipping right through our fingers and then we voluntarily bring in these elements that really just suck the Vitality out of put the thing down you very intentional how we know we have to be really intentional how use it careful who you follow you may want all come to one of these Retreats give me your phone digital
show me to unfollow people for you not that I will do it that you don't have to follow how they just said yes so go ahead and head hurt your phone right now by the end of the show you can have a whole new set up right hand it over
 natureismetal gone you guys think that's Entertainment that's that stuff is the education that study is and I understand the interesting thing is Yoga teachers people run their own businesses you actually have to do it if you don't have a social media presence your your lost in the material
 okay that's just saying it's a slippery slope because you got to post you got to make things just yesterday I was telling everybody that spread my real around advertise my book
necessity it sells books but it's a slippery slope and get on to it and you can feel my getting validated for people liking this car people commenting on this what is there comment it's one of those comments that don't weigh the same you get 20 good Thomas and one bad I meant that weighs right is differently is it is different how that affects you and how you take it in and it even the stuff that you're not directly involved in like just you just scrolling and observing like I find this happens about once every day or or two days I find myself stuck scrolling
 and you it happened you know it's pretty easy to hack in Coast scuba and isn't what would Coast scuba do the key then then I find myself I'm watching stuff you don't need to just like 10-second clips and some of them and then I say this is totally in name
I want to check out the full one on YouTube now let me find that injecting stupidity right into my veins yeah it is I've seen the stuff you follow I think it's really easy to get to get locked into that and it's just making us dumber and it's making us more depressed we got to get outside get in the song get into nature do some breathing do some meditation I can help you hear some wisdom associate with people that lift you up and you're going to be happy or you're going to feel you have purpose you have meaning you going to develop all all the kind of good qualities that we're going to read about today but there's a powered hate isn't there it's a whole nother thing there's a power and finding somebody to hate you know what you know what's going on
in my in my feeds whether it's on YouTube or anything right now alright you know what comes up is the WNBA right it's like right cuz he's too girls just came up in it you know it like with the rookies now and it's like they're being ranked as Rivals is a whole racial element to it there's like there's all this is it a whole lot kind of like your your man too kind of like hate one and not the other you know like which one do you think I thought you were like it sucked into it is it is I can't I can't flip something open without seeing it and I just seems like just let the girls play some basketball why is everyone trying to kind of co-opted into their political agenda sure and end in den and just like it just it's another thing to pour gasoline on our fire hate you know sure the hate that's how it works
this was before if this is in the 1970s and it happen it would just be something that you watch on television every now and then in the whole thing would be like so much cooler but yeah but now it's like snowed some of that you're engaging with 25 times in a day and it's just stoking your your your ignorance you know when you're going to sell there's nothing to be no reality show is based on a big family you know you in one of those Little House on the Prairie brother is so bad but then we touched The Waltons we took it up a notch I grew up on The Waltons Eight is Enough shells are like completely suck dick The Partridge Family and then they had to take a little crazy or I don't know that completely but okay today is like imagine a reality show where like you know they have black housewives of Beverly Hills or it's so no one wants to Wild ok
you want like a grown people dysfunctional fighting is making us sick it's making a sick and itself towards the motive passion word extremes would like I would like a soda sweet we like our coffee super-sized you know they look that nice European friends how big is a drink are you guys going to drink what's the matter with you guys so small road rage was just like oh my gosh because I was like okay I want this Quattro Formaggio pizza but I want you know eggplant on it and cherry tomatoes and I want you to cook it really well and you have a lot of details
explicit directions on avocado pit
 the mirror this what I want to do while you have the phone with you I want you to follow see if there's like a Little House on the Prairie thread just got him hooked on that cuz Waltons just like that's the stuff that should be coming up finished feed. I'm on it or you know I have a file I follow anyway I'm just screwing around now but we understand the point could make it out of your phone with my point if you feel sick. This is why it's not helping and taking some anti depression turn it down to turn it off on subscribe unfollow only put pot pies on messages in your head wake up early shower twice a day and eat fresh fruit going a little cleanse go to bed early turn off the TV don't stop paying for cable I can help you
thank you Robin. That's what that's what I thought that's what I was going for not the like the debate about labels right that's what I wanted out of not Mike General
 okay let's go to the bog time says about all this
 item arrived on the most get the idea and I'm driving to Rotom Rotom witches are very means of Conquest what should I respectfully Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on tuner and Ricci the super machine being a mother starts watching the goddess of learning today of the author not stop vibration h a w a i i
where's the pure devotees all that is troublesome to the heart would become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord
 will be established in the heart as in a revocable fact that the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance keys at their Lotus street beat chapter 11 text 8 to 12 we're still in the midst of all these things that civilized people do you say 30 principles you can say that it says they're followed by human beings this is what gets us off the animal level and can bring us to the stage of Dharma & alternative bhakti I think it's like the last 10 of them are like straight up Bucky and the ones before that are like favorable for clean living first heard that thing
when I first became that in the Box they they say this in a very common phrase from the bottom of time but devotees will use this in their preaching or they'll say that we're not human until you fall asleep and regulations of the subconscious eating sleeping Mae Mae dating and defending and we are no we said we are polished right polish to animal we might need a little nicer we might be to Mesa Restaurant have a have a Posturepedic mattress what I tell you you don't like the big gulp right you take you take a big cop that's bigger than your stomach and your bladder combined and your head like toxic corrosive sugar yeah
not going to have just a little bit Yeah man like an animal wouldn't be that dumb right animal has some instant we're sort of got this Free Will and we have a free will to break our Natural Instinct and just about to eat cold things on cold days you know we like we're missing we're missing a chip in the brain it's like God give us the Free Will chip and we like okay we want
 all right so where are we on this list we were coming along for a while we were on there
 Garmin gradually taking leave of an SMS to Larry gauge meant to be do that observing the futility of unnecessary activities of humans think I would do that for start-up to remain a silent grave just real fast just run through and we won't discuss him these are the general principles be followed by a human being
I thought we said the
 the manual
 are human body truthfulness Mercy austerity observing fast and certain days of the month bathing twice a day tolerance discrimination between right and wrong control of the Mind Control the senses nonviolent celibacy charity reading of scripture Simplicity satisfaction rendering Services saintly persons
 gradually taking leave of unnecessary engagements
 the students are growing right there observing the futility
 of the unnecessary activities of human society you got to be so thoughtful reflective on that going to be okay remaining silent
you be quiet and Grave and avoiding unnecessary talk so you know me always would take vows of Mount of rhetoric complete silence for a long. Of time all different types of Interest like toughest thing with the mind right ways to experiment with the effect it has on your mind we were just reading today in the in the car on the drive here about the Duke Bubba group of yogis and Indians that eat nothing except milk
 Nestor Val got everything is Mona Bubba's in the morning Bubba they just don't talk they just given up talking and whenever you make some type of
you get some type of benefit you know he might develop some some power you said you do you do you develop some palate in your ear senses become your other senses become a little bit more sharpened you need to do you say you need to use your ears more write your sense of touch more and so so performing these yogic experiments on how these regulations affect the mind is something that's always been there in the old tradition in our particular path of bhakti yoga dark a dose of remaining silent means remaining silent to all the to talk that's not uplifting that's not related to depression. You know like that like it you just renounce all that kind of talk which is if we did that what would be left how much did you left just in question
yeah yeah especially with me I talk a lot. You could have like in your couple in your in your talk more than your wife or did your wife talk more than you does your wife talked to more than you I pray I talk more on her
 yeah I talk more than Mara
 I'm around. Go pee who talks more
 I'm getting a bunch of Lori pad talks a lot but Brian talks more than Lori saying the chief point to each other for men
 okay just not
 I won't work with Carlos of the you don't make of a man-woman thing right now if we just talked about Krishna conscious stuff I don't necessarily think we change them
why people like me and arm are 90 and Brian the chief we got Big Mouth like we talked about anything all the time but if we are more Krishna conscious I don't we might start a little bit when we cut the fat you know 20% come off and we just talk more about spiritual things all the testicle and you would be considered remaining silent if you did that if if you're always singing about the Holy Name all the time and talk about spiritual things that is silence Sound of Silence
 hello darkness my old friend The Sound of Silence use a Zen koan you're a living Zen koan Prabhu and whether one is the body or the soul okay write that sister to think about these things that's right sign trained for this kind of thing of you being a human am I this body
because it has a beard when I got to cut off the beard I got that beer at all where am I now if I'm the slim what if I lose this limb and my still me am I still me or even the subtle body the mind right that they don't I think about that a lot you do people get plastic surgery all the time you know so that's your beauty sometimes for disguises and both times
 O'Hara's laughing at guys will get a whole face job but my point is once you change the face are they a different person know the same person person different face same person different face so what are we and even State something if you lose their minds anything
a life
 and I told you that happened to me once when I was a kid I could remember anything about my life but I forgot like stuff like I forgot how I remember it so I told you about that we talked about I can't remember that you forgot I was I was in 5th grade and I was playing kickball you know like on pavement
 and I think I was playing first yes playing first base and they threw the ball to me to let you know when someone's run it was like a big guy that's like around the 1st and he knocked me over and I and I hear you do I check my to sorry that's okay I can take a little pleasure I did ship today I finally got to repair like 30 years later but
 but then they took me to the nurse in the school you know and then never said what happened was like
I had no idea of searching my mind I searched every corner I wish I couldn't find what it happened to make caution but but the fact is you know a lot of meditate at the earliest practice is a meditation right when you sit down and do some breathing to relax and then you begin to preserve your mind and you watch the thoughts in your mind come and go and you get the hopefully get the profound experience I'm not this mind the might as well it's moving on its own accord and it's something that I can observe as a as a separate being as as I observe my bottoms are my mind they're not considering whether one is the body or the soul this is I am something else I'm something beyond that I'm something non-material and something Eternal then there is that thing that next level of spiritual growth when you realize
 all my desires are making me miserable and you start that have this thing about like these are just desires and I know they won't even in other with its programming in my mind that has
can do with me and dragging me around yeah or when you start fasting and you start to be ever get into fasting feel like I'm not even hungry yet my senses are bullying me to the fridge I've been programmed that way if you break a dipped of behavior you realize wow I was out of control. Are you walking into that snack Plaza drug and I are snack Pantry has a bad rep River of my old look at me and I'm sure you if you were an addict to something you think I want that drug I want that fix I want that or and I want to spend whatever is pulling you your mind your senses your genitals whatever is dragging you around there's a when you get the realization that I'm separate from this urge and that's a big step and spiritual enlightenment
 oh it's it's
the game changer and so right here so you need to consider that you need to consider that regularly throughout the day. That's why there's everyday it says so right in the Preamble on listen to this every day everything that's Troublesome to your heart because Raticate it isn't that a great promise it's good one
 let's continue
 okay we Simplicity subtraction considering whether okay considering the song
 Distributing
 distributing food equally
 to all living entities both men and animals
I mean it means you feed the animals too
 what animals do you make sure that everyone in the community is being fat okay all right you know I take care of dogs okay we have animals like feed them and feed the dogs maybe the birds need a little enough for us and sometimes the animals in the neighborhood need a little food
 nobody goes hungry
 very important we can't just you know there's something in the you know and we live in a crazy world where everything is so messed up it's hard
 but there's something wrong if we're sitting down and enjoying food and others can't sure you know it is hard to the heart if we just live that way and we don't think of others had that know you know it hard is a hard it hit hard and so hard it makes it
 hard towards bhakti
Evolution towards love they were trying to help so there's a regulation built into the to the lifestyle of the progressive dharmik human being how you need to be concerned that everybody always sit on the India sometimes you're you're buying something in the shop and often times it's something frivolous so I don't got to buy a new Corte a new shirt or something and then a beggar will come by and you feel like a little so guilty or something you're buying supper and then the shopkeeper cuz in New York City or train just like ignore Beggars or I'll be over while my back to the shop people every shopkeeper kiosk and they haven't paid that if I were to do well in business I need to be charitable right yeah it's not pure devotional service but it is better than me I'm standing there trying to ignore them buying a fancy shirt so I look cool for you so you think I'm cool and we should also have the faith that the Beggars are we meeting the street also they can't be ignored
 I can't be ignored we spoke about this before
yeah she sounds like you're like what maybe they can be a terrible I just got to you know what is $7 I'll give you what you like to do for everybody you know what I mean and what you do in your you locally you know think I mean cuz if you go to India and there's like you give to a few people and then I Surrender by the surrounded by thousands will this one's name is little kids that don't really need it all kids don't need to know a lot of those kids don't they're just you know just trying to go buy some more candy
 are they you know you do I've seen people just bring a little candy with you you know what that's a good that's a good plan but you're like what it what is like it like in gold on or around
they will carry pencils and you give the kid a pencil like wow I'm so sorry cool thing cut the welfare of every living being given charity right now it's important if we have Surplus money now that we were into the shop distribution it's a big part of our mission to give to charity
 yeah okay well who do you give to the animals
 I just recently had a debt you know why because you've been too greedy and miserly that's why you got to give and it all comes back that's our philosophies or not
do you know what you give gift you give to the to the to the Sunday party Mooney School in and bring the oven you and the girls school that's a great charity to give to write you give to the you give to the cows at the Clover don't have protection, protection you know we need that at the end of how important how things are. One must giving charity you know really seeing Every Soul especially in the human form as part of the Supreme Lord
 sing every song of big one we only tend to think well my friends they're part of God but this idiot this idiot politician ever been part of God did this is the talk about this in school
 yeah
little upset about that I was like a lot of girls that's all I was doing in school buddy the teachers you know this why wasn't built into the curriculum that at least a contemplate decide you some people in the world believe that every living being is part of God why didn't you hear that did you know what I saw I saw him in school at all well hopefully you got it did you get some of that then but you know I saw something I saw on social media clip yesterday and I had a kid
 and he got it was he got it through psychedelics
 but he got a feeling that God is everywhere
 he wasn't he wasn't like addicted to drugs or anything like that he just had this one experience and then he was telling his mother
 don't you feel it I can feel it God is everywhere God is in everyone
mother just said no no no God is God is someone that you don't see it until you die and she had a child committed
 horrible he comes through with the right way I think this is stuff we should be learning from one more like just took 3 years old that had him, wasn't available at isbill practically speaking wasn't available. If you in the mother and she was saying after you died and she actually hadn't committed it's for like the old days it was black and white whatever was no parking 270 days okay. About the activities and instructions given by the screen press doubt it. Head who is the shelter of the saintly person to write a nail sunga together Sunday chanting about these activities with weave
now we've moved into the pure bhakti instructions here chancing about these activities are enchanting shove them care to hearing about them chanting and speaking about them and it's marnham like me tomorrow now that I said I just singing in the car singing singing singing in the car
 always remembering these activities and instructions always remembering activities and that's where your meditation goes right you bring you consciously bring your mind to remembering what You Christmas lyrics do you sometimes remember Leela Krishna said to sit back and not just that but philosophies the philosophy of life that's there to talk about World War 1 about Krishna Leela Papa started in Sarajevo with the assassination of the Rings where did you go
 yeah and so it's it's
wow is that this was a huge thing at the whole thing triggered World War 1 how did you get to World War 1 we're just talking about here and you're talking about do you think about God I said yeah but I think about I do that till I go to bed I think about Lourdes drinking it cuz I seen that song every night but I'm saying Monday Mysteries are happening in life you got to think about that and apply the bog of a time to life who is this about reading the Christmas story but there is something about that to me about Krishna Leela we got a big sign about that all right just some exclusive time don't water down a place where the prince was assassinated so it's good to help what what is that got to do with my life was that has something to do with like here's a huge thing it's triggered
 tens of thousands of deaths World calamity
how important our life is that was a whole world war it's so many people to vote even know about it so many Americans have never even down there we don't even know about Prince Ferdinand these are like in this is our life I think I'm so significantly I think it's so important and if it's over in a moment like a sneeze in Eternal time I think it's important to meditate like that that that that I'm not agree with you but I also want to emphasize
 that we should set aside some time exclusively for meditating on Christmas
 pastimes yeah every day we were reading about it in this book right now so that's why I brought it up I'm kind of speaking about it cuz we just read about hearing about the activities instructions given activities and instruction with Tom is he active
is Bhagavad Gita is the instructions instructions world history who is the dancing thing is you have to learn to see the philosophy wherever you're going with everything that you do I'm all for it I said that wide why do you keep defending that is every time I read on already surrendered that and then I just added one more thing and I said the original thing that you said you'd be what you ignored and blue pass and blue
 text Angela world I don't I acknowledge your thing I validated you're okay trying to render service performing worshipping
