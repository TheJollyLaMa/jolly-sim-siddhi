 Alright you ready for a nugget sir I'm ready for you got what you got I got something good but your favorite Christian in mind he might be my favorite Christian really more than st. Francis let's see if you come to see see that might change earlier I've been to Susie now but if you come on this trip I've been different job and you just because you've been there doesn't mean that it's been fully revealed to you right has been we know people that well he welcomed me personally he he gave me a vision you lie liar
I like it but I'm going to have to go c.s. Lewis please my brother go to see if I can levitate look I can turn water into wine I can give you a plate of spaghetti magically
 how can I do understand okay you want me over with a cannoli
 alright I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen now so not only because I see it
 but because
 buy it
 I see everything else soon as I seeing with the lens
 oh God
 men's of God sing with the lens or Divine Divine mission right you know I think this speaks to the idea of
weather in Pierre
 proof is necessary to have faith reasonable Faith rational faith in God right because you know we don't need to see the sun to know that the sun has risen we don't need the empirical proof of seeing the actual son because when we can see everything else by the by the grace of the sunlight you understand that the sun has risen and Cersei really although their baby know what an end this part you know like there's so many interesting text that we have you know it in the in the bucket tradition yeah that's speak to how God can be perceived through the to the material sense is that that there are there is such a thing as spiritual senses senses that are capable of perceiving spirit and they're kind of lying dormant within us the one we see through the material eyes
we won't be able to see Spirit but to speak of to see God but what we can do is see a nut see through the
 the the text that Unity sacred text and when we see through them we we we develop the faith and it gives us a way of putting it all together oh I get it all makes sense when I put all these pieces together I'm not this body that makes sense you know I'm a spark of spirit that has a different nature that makes sense that you know my mind and senses have been programmed in ways that are not harmonious with my nature and therefore I experience depression and boredom and anger and frustration and disappointment and someone that makes sense I got to get them under control then I can feel my nature underneath that makes sense they are there laws of karma in time that makes sense there these do you know that the Goon is that make sense
ultimately there's a designer behind it and it has a benevolent kind of way of working you know when you hear this all play out it all makes sense and then when you go through your life and see it through that land it all starts clicking and you can see how it can that the more that I'm able to embrace it and live according to the more I evolve the better person I become the more capable I am of seeing truth excetera excetera so through that I see everything right that it gives me a vision to see everything and therefore that face is rational in in real even though you can't even though if you were to say to me can you show me God or have you seen God yourself with your own eyes maybe not but I'm seeing the world through this and it's all making sense
 this reminds me of that thing by the Hungarian writer I can remember his name but it was very cool thing. I pulled it up in the mother's womb
who's the writer I don't know if they're two babies one asked the other do you believe in life
 after delivery the other replied of course there has to be something after delivery nonsense of the first there's no life after delivery what kind of life would that be the second said I don't know but there will be more light than there is here maybe we will walk with our legs and feet with our mouths maybe we will have other senses that we can understand right now the first replied that's absurd walking is impossible than eating with our Mouse ridiculous the umbilical cord supplies nutrition in the cord is so short life after delivery is to be logically excluded there you go the second incest
well I think there's something and maybe it's different than it is here maybe we don't need this physical cord anymore the first replied nonsense and more of moreover if there is life then why is no one ever come back from their delivery is the end of life and in the after delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and Oblivion delivery takes us nowhere
 well I don't know so the second but certainly we will meet mother when she will take care of us this is a good one the first recliner mother are you actually believe in mother that's laughable if Mother exists where is she now that is a great one I think like they're actually surrounded by much but it does it say that but mother is all around us as it does
she's all around us we are surrounded by her we are of her it is in her that we live without her this world would not exist at all see her the other so it is only logical that she does not exist and the second said something very beautiful sometimes when you're in silence and you focus and you really listen you can perceive her presents and you can hear her loving voice calling down from above that is a great story isn't it I thought it was actually I thought it's great I thought I was going to say actually you can hear her breathing or something like that to which is a hundred or so later Harvey I would have been interesting way to say to this is our relationship with our relationship the mother in the womb she's everywhere she's so
rounding us she's feeding us yet we still are no not here it's a come on I'm not sure what that has to do with the Fibonacci spiral God is the same as our relations with the macro micro even the tiniest sections perfectly fits perfectly mathematically the same okay
 thank you for that rugged. That was perfect I think we tried that once before on the show but I really like that I thought it was like blows my mind how like these Highly Educated men can come up with such weak philosophy some sort of such a weak logic like there's no need for God because we have no proof of him and we exist without that proof that there's no need for God and their forgot
you're not even a child in the womb logically just doesn't make sense and in the fact that they embrace it even though they're so intelligent means there's something psychological going on here there's some there's some hesitancy to accept it on the psychological level maybe they just need to come to terms with that there's a great word or phrase in the buggy. My apraxia meaning your intelligence even your great intelligence even your doctorate or you're in your PhD or your SAT score intelligence it's been stolen by illusion you have that intelligence you know how to take apart a hardware is there the hardware is there to to calculate but it's missing the essential so it's been stolen by illusion so therefore that intelligence just gets you deeper and deeper in my I should have very very smart people just ruin their life with
choices very smart
 and another thing about those very very smart people cuz you're mentioning is they won't even enter into the conversation about it and I know it's just like no that won't believe in your fairy tales
 she's all around us is all around quiet your mind
 alright right and I like that I like that one. Yeah c.s. Lewis Hungarian author thank you both. Mary music

so would laying out
 the the social responsibilities that we have according to our
 temporary
 mindsets you say our temporary circumstances right
 and how they all serve to kind of bomb help the individual evolve but also they serve two to build a very Cooperative Society
 a dog and allergies he already talked okay in this time of emergency were talking about these emergency is about when we should adopt another person's yeah just like during wartime rocket you know you took up You Got a Boy Scout first aid merit badge
 do you have a badge and then I do have a
how's your first day of matter fact is it is that knowledge kind of still with you not at all you would know how to help a person if they like bro, I know how to apply pressure I can't remember how to get likes no apply pressure tank that I'm out of a snake venom out of a leg what if someone like broke their arm stuff
 okay I know how to identify if it's broken
 anyway I should probably take that course again I should probably take a CPR course I speak again I know it would probably see the yard I think everybody should have like become EMTs or least know how to do the basic stuff
 what show do you think is right now I'm already squirrely squirrely to disasters in types of emergency
one may accept any of the various types of professions known as America America America America but one should not it anytime except the profession of a dog and a yes all this professional dogs the profession of Sheila collecting grains from the field is called the Ripta collecting without begging is called amritha grains is called healing the ground is called from Rita and trade is called engaging in the service of a low-grade person's however is called Spa the profession of the dogs
 special specifically barometers and treacherous should not engage in the low Eminem Bominable service of sudras barometers
be well acquainted with all Vedic knowledge and chut Ria's should be well acquainted with the worship of demigods does Castile ready to go it's not a squirrel cuz it's some point it is what do you know like when we were kids like teenagers what would we do for a job that was what was supposed to have some grotesque jobs van and cleaned motel rooms when we were sixteen of State loss to be do I worked in kitchens and fast food joints I delivered one to that place and I'm sick and I'm tired when I was really young. I'm like Italian like
 well in any case yeah I work at Burger Joint kitchen
cuz I work at dump delivered one more low-grade jobs but it was common like this among young people in the city that time to come a bicycle message
 Our Generation we were when we were hanging out in the city bike messenger you if you did that I was like I do that kind of thing could just drop and pick up anytime you want you know it's late and downsize New York city actualize so but I remember the first job I got it to messenger it was in my inside the first or second day and back then you had beepers you know and you have to keep checking in with the dispatcher yeah and then I go to my page and despite any just started screaming his head off at me you know why I don't even remember why
 but I was just like I just rolled back to this
Hatcher and it in the Beeper I said I'm done for you if you still on reasonable you know you think I'm your dog and you can just like yell at me if I forget it but I think hear it do you know it's it's giving us kind of gradation of dependence on another you know it's one thing to just walk through the field and pick up the grains that the farmer did slip through the farmers kind of like harvesting mechanism you know and if you do that you're really not dependent on anyone you know as long as a pharmacy to get whatever you want to pick up some you know if it doesn't yet you're not you're not indebted to anyone you're not in the charge of anyone you are you keep your Independence in a sentence
 and then and then it goes up the line to more and more to wear your like working for an employer and you have to satisfy that employer but still you shouldn't work for a dog in our you should become a dog you know for someone that's really not
qualified and specifically the brahmins in the charges he's very important spiritual and political is really not the right word but they're like what what kind of shaped that type of leader they're like the rulers you know
 I can't quite think of the right word but would we give that to politicians now we give that role to politicians but it's just really you know the Protectors of societal is real
 okay
 all right I text 21
 finish that go together getting married like pointed to help me Glenn. Come here and help me the symptoms of a Brahman are control of the mind control of the senses austerity and Penance cleanliness satisfy
action
 forgiveness Simplicity knowledge mercy truthfulness and complete surrender to the Supreme personality of God looking for a tattoo people this could be it, the most episodes is right of the bhagavad-gita what you can do
 Karina come on and I want you to start quoting 12-month to learn some quotes from that
 Karina is a Carreta know I got to ask her to unmute you want to do you know that verse the qualities of a Brahmin know
 some of the most episodes ever been to Shazam.
2008 songs that don't have been molesting I'm not control of the market to the dissenters are 13th and then that's a discussion for giving us a certain knowledge message no don't lie to me it's bad karma to DC's right now to Corona Corona cousin Diane you are proud of you proud of your summer, right mind this summer
 control the senses the muthappa austerity sochem the clean internally and externally we tend to become if we're fortunate were clean it externally wet wake up take a shower
but actually there's got to be internal cleanliness the mind can be client clean or can be dirty Sean P they've got to be forgiveness forgiveness such a big one because I don't mind clean to your satisfaction I like it seems like that will come from forgiveness that will come from control the senses now may be satisfied they were together that's why I think the word satisfaction hear the word contended might might be more helpful for us because he had it in other words it's like okay you know what I'm going to be content without having the latest computer in the latest car and then be content with having three pairs of shoes instead of having 15 pairs of shoes I want to be good to you know you just kind of discipline yourself to be content okay I'm a knocking allow my mind
to drive me to try to achieve these things that I really don't need from that than mine settles it's easier to forgive it's harder to forgive when you feel like someone's competing for your parachute when you're when you're content with you know with your your simple pair then it'll be easier to forgive it'll be easier to have a a peaceful mind it'll be easier to control the census excetera that's right I suppose you all work together
 I don't think I'm Santosh
 you're not content
 what are you thinking for the little things used to get on your skin and just haunt me daily I don't think stupid things she let her brother borrow it for one of our hold it when did she get a new car you know her car when she has her that she said that for years now but two years but anyway the point is her cuz she let her borrow brother borrow for a day. He put a little ding in the door that would be free to out
and like she didn't say anything about it he denies it and I'm like dude we got to look at this thing everyday now you got you got a brand new car it's like everything's perfect up his car and will Ding and the door is is it's going to drive me as everyday that thing drives me insane little dented everyone except me getting under your skin it's under my skin right now I'd let it go have it fixed and I know I know I know I know I just wanted to say in Hindi
 what to do if it's getting it fixed is what's going to help you let it go then maybe maybe maybe you know I'm sure I'm sure people like Linda would have that thing fixed in the second when Mike tolerate anything out of place among those suction cup C I guess there's a
the bigger dense but it's a dent I'm not Santosh I get it cuz I'm going to keep doing this thing until I get santosha on y'all santosha then santosha mercy yeah. Yeah that's the vegan cheese. You Mercy. Mercy.
 Achuthan accepting oneself as an eternal serving the lord that server chuta that give my life my heart my truthfulness
 these are Brahma luxinum the symptoms of a Brahmin
 alright so did you have this is a rum and I realize that this is
that this is what this is what they call today this is what the spiritual leaders have to go through this with the teachers if you have a teacher
 Any teacher the supposed to be called debating this right
 all of these qualities
 oh I had some crazy teachers who has a kid
 people disturbing teachers you know you had some disturbing teachers definitely
 definitely some creepy people are teachers not in Krishna Consciousness in school high school high school high school middle school
 yes here's the here's the qualities that that spiritual leader that teacher is is embracing controlling the senses before me a little austerity and healthy you know the parents always made very clean you know that never bathed
PS I did everybody knows it yet yeah it any of the external cleanliness is important because it lends the internal Clinic is internal peace of mind and so on
 forgiveness satisfactory all these beautiful qualities hope they work together well if we're together all right next to be influential in battle unconquered patient challenging and charitable to control the bottle in the acessories to be forgiving to be attached to the nature and to be always jolly and truthful these are the symptoms of a Trattoria I think when it's his patient like another as we hear the things that we think calmly when we think of the warrior right this this real cuz again let's really try to understand what the treasure is there the people
are responsible for the management of the society
 and they kind of capture that right rather than to not voted into office they stand up and say I will be the protector right and and people recognize that they have the power to do it but it's constrained Within These ethical guidelines and in so we commonly think of them as this person has influential in battle you know will stand up to the challenge that is charitable as well say that they control their bodily necessitated that they're going to need to be someone that got you no self-discipline strong self-discipline right but then we hear a patient for giving Jolly attached to the Bermuda cool nature it means to have an appreciation for that nature and they recognized I don't have that so much myself so I'm dependent on receiving counsel from someone that does have it
Mike is there going to be more touch with true they're going to deeper Insight I appreciate that nature but to be patient Jolly forgiving I think that's to temper their tendency toward violence because we know we know people like that you know my old friends
 the whole crew
 had like a there into violence like they're impatient they got us two real they got a thrill from violence Santosh answer that that that that's very dangerous Tennessee
 but as we were speaking about yesterday it's not like you just wrote that out of someone's psychology's is it may be with Asian and so on that happens but when that's a young man rather than just try to shame that out of someone what you do is you get in the ethical codes by which they can harness that to protect others rather than to her
others and so I think that's where the one needs to be patient right when I want to Dole out my power right now and give me and my friends were like that they eat when they got into Krishna Consciousness we're going to go down going to go down this dark hole too far down but my point is they were just looking for the excuse to beat someone up that was like mistreating a devotee or something like that or they're just like eager to like you know tempted to use it and so they need to be patient they need to say and you know what they were trained those things from the panchatantra and so are they they teach like here are the four different steps you go through to dealing with someone that's going to be a problem in your state right first you can try to reason with them second you can try to offer them something that will get them to change their mind you do 30 can do this last of all is the Done. Right is the stick it's actually like having to use physically threatened them yeah yeah yeah
patient you know to go through that process otherwise they're going to be misusing that physical Force it'll be bad for them it'll be bad for the other is a psychology there's a psychology that you're not going to destroy changed psychology you just have to harness that psychology yes yeah harness it for the good super good it's just like in war it's like a lot of people are not meant for war and yet there is no doubt Wars but wars exist and Wars happen and you need you need a class of people like all right I'm going to face all this stuff and I'm both sides are saying that the war is only between the Warriors they go out far away from everyone else right and then one of the one of the group's wins and then the other citizen say okay now we accept your rule but nobody goes and burns down their homes and bombs the innocent people and it all of that is just like they're going to decide they're going to step forward in between themselves are going to decide who's going to rule and they're going to fight that out themselves
all right enough of you and your foot but we can but we can understand hear how a barometer how the spiritual teacher could could you could say discipline or guide the Warrior by saying it because we need to fight now and end the end the end the did the brahmins says no no no and then they will quote the verse just like Corona to do you know and didn't say Hey where's your patience right now we haven't gone through all the steps to see if we can avoid physical force in this you got to slow down
 be patient and let's try to work this out of the ways and if and if in the end physical force is necessary then you would we trust that you're ready to step up and do that but we're not there yet be patient right you know what I think I will say it's one thing that I really did like about Krishna Consciousness was the fact that Krishna is all attractive and he attracts all different type
some people is not just like while you go to a church you think everyone's nice and everybody in that and there are certain things you change when you start practicing bakit but there's certain things that are so deeply woven into what we are or psychology that they don't change but we just sort of refine them or we harness them or we use them in a better way yes but we don't fake because of Wiz never meet people that became a born-again Christians are there like they completely like almost like they're been brainwashed I guess people any religion people to this dude I guess even Christmas Christmas people do this too but I feel like put on an external show of external show has been into ality
 text me crazy you're still here so
who is driving me crazy your peace I want to kill your peace all right let's keep going being always devoted to the demigods the spiritual Master of the Supreme Lord Vishnu endeavoring for advancement in Dharma Economic Development since gratification right the Dharma Arctic, believing in the words of the guru and the scripture and always endeavoring with expertise in earning money these are the symptoms of the baixa Disco through that again
 the always devoted always devoted to the demigods the spiritual master in the Supreme Lord okay so your understanding that your success is not just you being so clever and so there's higher beings reciprocating Grandy's that's a sacrifice this is the opposite of what we call it America the self-made man we don't believe anybody self-made your endeavor
as part of the work you have it also there's reciprocating forces of the universe and ultimately Guru Guru and God you know and I think you know when it says devoted to the demigods to the personified forms of of all the blessings in life is right the sun in the rain and it and all that and wealth locksmith going to ask me to go to 6th Street in New York City every one's got Ganesh on their door remove the obstacles of me getting rich and in with all of the kind of rituals that that one would perform the different rights that one would do to satisfy that if they always involve they always have that charitable aspect for the business person right then you supposed to feed everyone you know you supposed to have to feed them you know or won't be success than you meant to give charity you know at the end of this unit all the drama
the Japan good at these places where they have worship worship of demigods is there in every business and its public sometimes they have a little altar set up going to try to town is a little altar set up with her they're doing some religious work in hopes for a financial Kickback I'm not even complaining about it I'm saying we don't even do that we just think than a higher level than it is a higher line materialism here
 from the bucket perspective we denounce that idea
 but we appreciate it as a step up where is America's to see that they're like look at this crazy thing they're doing the corner of actually it's actually a more refined way of seeing the world ever go to do see that in Chinatown there's like a little alter the corner of the store there's a little cookie on it something like that the Jade figurine little Jade figurines of some master a little II fortune cookie
the way I have full faith in fortune cookies yes they always come true from a serious man I don't know if that's quite fits into our I think it does I think God is all-powerful and all-knowing and I feel like he gives me information and just talkin about the method of epistemology as laid out in vedant I'm not sure if it's consistent with I believe that God is behind everything and therefore it that full faith allows before that means every loud for me to pick the right Fortune Cookie table I will go right for the one that will speak to me I believe in the opening the books randomly to find out what you should do for the day your lesson I believe in that Corona doesn't know what a fortune cookies I don't have Chinese restaurants are in Lebanon
 I doing fortune cookies crack it open in the sky
meet beads you learn harmonium what kind of childhood are you doing over there laughing on the only one I know never heard of Daffy Duck Daffy Duck just like I know that you have to type of doctor put up a little picture of a fortune cookie there for the Coronas and you crack that thing open those little slip of paper and it tells your fortune or gives you some advice in life is incredibly accurate like a Ouija board except that is just as accurate as a Ouija board believes in the Crazy 8 ball that you shaved you sure those are nonsense
 text Tony for offering obeisances to the higher sections of society all that rubs my
devices
 always very clean being free from duplicity these are good things serving one's master
 performing sacrifice without uttering mantras okay
 not stealing their speaking the truth and giving all protection of the cows and brahmins these for the symptoms of the business owners are always worried that they're their employees are stealing from the market sure for sure where I got the pens are missing where the sprinkler where's the flat screen TV there 10 Lara bars in the closet yesterday so but yet so you know again we and I think we talked about this yesterday yeah that they're offering obeisances to the higher sections
they're hired because of their sacrifice that they're making and because of their Ingenuity and because of their prowess and because of their learning you know it is is there's a qualification for all of this and you don't have it that's going to be the the rare people in society as smaller percentage of people society and society and rather than showing our respect to the pop star or the athlete or the attractive person the model or whatever you show show to righteous people that are taking up big-time responsibilities it's natural it's important it's civilized is refined
 are we doing 7:53 if you want to keep you up today if you come did you read the report on the shooter was pretty good it is everyone's experience that workers were servants are generally Customs stealing probably say everybody steals all the workers steal its if they steal too much that's when you got to worry
when you have a crappy job that you steal I couldn't say that I never stole anything but that was pretty insignificant
 okay
 there's tiny very small
 is before cameras
 now it's like they got cameras on you
 is Sue dramatic a first-class serving is one who does not steal here it is recommended that a first-class Soldier must remain very clean does not steal or speak lies and must always render Services master bedroom at 10 sacrifices in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies along with his master but he should not utter the month or as for these may be uttered only by members of the higher sections of society did they were it was a science and we could just show up and it's not like a concert you know what I mean
that's a whole nother thing that's our son kirtan is is a whole different way of approaching mantras it is not like the monsters than you hatch a baby
 buy them correctly now we're like begging people just chant busy like you had to work hard to get a month so we don't let someone drive a car until they've gone through certain training and prove that they can be responsible about it and that's what it was was learning Mantra Imogen will you far more serious imagine if we are like it's possible to have a car please drive a car to render service to the husband to always be favourably towards disposed towards the husband to be equally well disposed towards the husband's relatives and friends and to follow the boughs of a husband these are the four principles be followed by women described as chaste as I was reading this and then I suppose the next one watch go ahead and read the next one cuz it's this will refer to the Pheasant feathers little bit more I think they even more potentially
women must dress nicely
 this is like dr. Laura Schlessinger Berg's play something that is not only women but like when women are dressed nice
 it does up with the conscious people in general doesn't it I think so but I'm mansplain in it
 chase woman must dress nicely decorator self with golden ornaments for the pleasure of her husband it's good for everyone's mind I think it did upset me was in my let's hear it first and then we'll let the
 feminist thing within us packet always wearing clean attractive garments she should sweep and clean the household with water and other liquids
 like Pine saw the entire house is always pure and clean she should collect the household paraphernalia and keep the house always era
with incense and flowers and must be ready to execute the desire of her husband being modest and truthful controlling your senses and speaking sweet words a chaste woman should engage in the service of her husband with love
 according to time and Circumstance starts starts planning if you want me to stay here is how I see this this whole chapter in the general it seems to be the general trend of how text like The Bob & Tom speak these these ancient text is kind of the Opera with the assumption that people are going to be righteous should respond to you be so submissive to the Brahmin it if the Brahman is not qualified at the Brahman is not being fair at the wrong so they kind of like the default is that people are going to live up to their responsibilities
and these verses are in the context of like a seriously righteous and responsible husband that's that's taking on all responsibility of providing all care and it and you know all care of our protection or shelter to a family of course their General statements these are General statements have organized Society is that we drive on the right side of the road generally but sometimes you're on a dirt road and there's a single Lane Road and he can't drive in the right hand side he's our general ideas like for example in the in the next person who speaks like that's a chase women should engage with affection and service of her husband who is not fallen so this is a man who's doing the appropriate things of the head of the household and if things like that anymore because it's before basically speaking women even worked the women in the workplace controlling the reproductive system all these things these are all like new things and Society this is a
from 5000 years ago I mean that if people in the pastor say well women in the future will be just as just as engaged in the workplace as men will be and then they say okay but what about like the pregnancy and and and and caring for the children while they will take pills to control that and so that they don't become Somas it almost sounded crazy that's it so you won't have a baby you mean so you can enjoy your sense of gratification without any without any of the rest of my people will be into all these texts are rom
 they're kind of laying out a general path for people different psychology's or genders when we read the broader tax we
it's not that they're saying that there's no exceptions or that woman could not have to have you know it's serious social occupation and what to speak of when we apply at nowadays like the way that she'll probably try to apply this in the modern-day like when it came to America he even rolled into the reports of his books like my God Brothers many of them don't understand they never done what I've done come to the Western World seen the way people live see that they have a whole different world and you can't impose these things are you never get to the essence so I'm trying to give them back to you and and he said that it like for instance you say boys and girls they mix freely right we're in The Vedic and even the Indian society that they didn't grow up that way and he said I can't just come in and poses I might have to work with like where they're at and try to get to the essence and that's largely what are challenges today and then we can and we can see how
 because
