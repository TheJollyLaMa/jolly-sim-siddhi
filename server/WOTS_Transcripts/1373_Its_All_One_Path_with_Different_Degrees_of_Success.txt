 yeah rum less just walked in from her bill from bhakti stock all right love you buddy
 yoga today right now we got a nugget. You know I wanted to share it you know I'm going to I'm going to be the MC I just found out for the right to the right man for that job. A big b man you know
 I might be an okay from today's from Henry David Thoreau keep Sinker deep thinker the transit until
whenever I read any part of The Vedas so funny that says reading The Vedas back in the 1800s never ever read any part of the baddest I have felt that some unearthly an unknown light illuminated me in the great teachings of The Vedas there is no touch of sectarianism interesting it is all it is of all ages climbs and
 nationalities it is of all ages climbs and nationalities what does that mean climbs I think climbs means different strata like statuses okay and nationalities and is the Royal Road for the attainment of the of great knowledge the great knowledge of what lies yeah when I read it I feel that I'm under the Spangled heavens of a
good night
 who is that beautiful
 thank you for not going into Summer Nights song. All about that baby you know what I was saying yesterday it's another Kishore nimai that
 this is how we love him I do love him and I love him
 I was saying to that was trying to show yesterday I was like historically we see abrahamic religions conquering with the sword you coming to invade oh my God you remember that thing I sent you the other day that note about like
 land invasions planned conversions By The Sword they're all it's all hidden or secret it's on the desire to diary Diaries of the the Conqueror
who came how they're going to how they were going to conquer what they were going to do horrible things
 in Sonata, it's not like that they concur with culture the culture is so attractive you're like I want to be like this I want to eat like this I want to dance like this want to sing like this the religion is tied into your joy it's deeply tied in to the joy of life it's Sue Sue come car to get your mitts deeply joyfully performed that is the symptom of your doing things right it's not just like we got to be good cuz God's going to crush us it's not like we're living under some Authority authoritarian regime it's like a loving God that we are non-judgemental loving God come from a lot of households a lot of leftover religious stuff repealed judge
we feel unworthy it's not like that they eat it in boxes we have to get rid of that type of if if we grew up with this broken Christian type of thinking it's a it's a loving God and a compassionate God and we should have be like that to other people we should appreciate people's little steps forward and yeah
 it's very welcoming of other Traditions as well would you get out of this I know we're going to take so much here I actually think we did this is another once before but I think was worth bringing back this there's so much here first of all you don't let's just talk about the role for a second that there's one thing I want to mention that Henry David Thoreau that I thought his interesting in context of where we're at politically now and everything like that but sometimes we get this tension between like people calling for social justice
they can be highly critical of people that that are endeavoring to be deeply spiritual and those say that you're bypassing you're like just on your selfish little kind of thing you said you need to be stopping in just now went through lives will first will he in one sense he wanted became a Hermit right like he secluded himself in the forest
 and he did that to kind of try to understand himself better understand the world better you don't understand God better you know to have the space to think and go very deep within
 and you know those what he came up with you know influence you know thousands and thousands of people but it was from that platform of
 understanding to self sitting there reading
 Bhagavad Gita and upon a child's right experience
he's talking about how he's changed you know what he says when I read it I feel that I'm under the Spangled heavens of a summer night the way that I understand that
 is it giving you the very broad perspective are usually stuck in our very narrow perspectives of life you know like how you know how am I going to handle today and the people that have to deal with in am I going to make enough money and I'm going to get what I need to get him going to avoid the kind of suffering you know we're not very tight little perspective and he takes his books and it just opens it up I didn't realize all my problems are small all my circumstances are tiny there's there's a there's a broad infinite truth out there that we're all part of you know and through thinking like this in contemplating like this he came out of Walden which is where he secluded himself
 and he wrote a book called Civil Disobedience which was you know that the Injustice at that time was extreme which it was slavery especially that he was responding to his
I think that the Mexican-American War as well he was he was commenting on his butt in that book he argues how
 how in in Civil Disobedience he argues how we shouldn't allow governments to override our conscience how we have to have like a deeper inner moral compass that guides us you know you beyond the government and I am and how to respond to it in that book
 you know it was that book that influence Gandhi was that book that influence Martin Luther King you know it's like he went into his seclusion came out with the realest some realization about that much about the self about you know the nature of the soul and came out and gave us incredibly historically influential book on Justice you don't understand civil disobedience is like so that's one thing you know you got to tell me what to say about that first of all he was his clothes were to you
2 months and 2 days okay
 you're sometimes people have these things were like okay I'm going off all I'm going off Facebook for a week in the life of the word cologne that's like being in the woods to help whatever he was living in Concord Mass sir how actually quiet and Charming that Village must have been compared to how we live right now it was just it was just a just say I've been there before 2 to the Walden Pond know but I'm saying he's coming from somewhere he was coming he's coming from place that's already like totally was already a line how we live right now I hate text messages and see through things we could never imagine that our mind to become so complicated and nodded so that he stepped away to make it a little better I just want to see anybody
a thoughtful young man thoughtful young man so so that's I want to make that point first let's not be so judgemental about people trying to figure life out and figure out how they want to figure out their own a hard and their own mind and their own contribution to this world that's one thing but you know so much more do you like directly connected to what we're doing here right whenever I read any part of The Vedas and I again I believe when he says babe is he speaking of special about Bhagavad Gita in Upon a Child as far as I understand that's what he was reading yeah I have felt some now this is interesting on Earthly
 an unknown light
 illuminated me imagine how sensitive he was just like you're saying right he's coming from a world that's already not nearly as bizarre and warping is the world that we live in he's saying this is warping my perception this quiet little girl is just hanging out with cuz they have a you know summer
comes out and says hear you hear you on a stump every now and then you know it begins to stir up my emotions or some of that I'm going to go off into the real quiet and try to understand any pics of these books in this very open state of awareness and he says this is an ordinary information I'm reading right now I've read a lot of books yeah this is different this is on Earthly this is coming from another realm I feel it I feel and that's the claim of it is that these texts or approve sure that they're not made by any man that they're unearthly that there it's a vibration that's eternally existing of knowledge the great knowledge he calls it
 he's an ace and I have access to it through these books and I feel that it's a whole nother level of perception anybody could experience that make up make a simple 18 day challenge everything I say anything anymore but you make it
18 day challenge and everyday read one chapter the bug of agita and just see how you feel after you read it and walk away from it feeling a little high a little at peace it's a little broader understanding a little less stressed and why not do it in the gray teaching of The Vedas
 there is no touch of sectarianism it is of all ages climbs nationalities you see this is something with that he was feeling he's sure that he's read the Bible surely he's he's read other text of other different ideologies and so on if he was our age he would totally be in the bacta program with us no doubt they're right all day come on to some practical service and I just wanted quietly Chan for
things to be done Tuesday so that piece coming up and place them in that he that he really feels this in this is something again is the teams going to come up again today and what we read but this idea that there's no touch of sectarianism all ages all clients all nationalities because of your ass is communicating in a different way because he's the Great Sage we all say when he downloads this vibration and then record that he's he's recording and in a way that it's in the whole Bay to approach
 is that it's not going to try to immediately wrestle you into submission to the highest truth is going to meet you where you're at and it's going to nudge you up to the next stage of your Evolution, take another step in evolution take another step you know so that's something that's unfamiliar to the Western mind it's it's a little different and it can be confusing you know
 very interesting
of course the message board comes in Timothy Tucker saying actually live close to his parents in Paris with Mom would bring him cookies and it was greatly exaggerated how's your mother might have brought him some cookies
 it was a mile and a half of his family home there I said I've been to the little cabin I don't know if it's a re-creation of the cabin basically Recreation costs to buy to replika and they put a little bug of agita it's in there did you put it in as a book distributor on Route 5. He was reading okay let's go
changed his life all right you ready to get into it yes sir or something before I started to shoot my dog with Tom witches are very means of Conquest when should I respect obeisances to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you the most human being with Mother Saraswati the goddess of learning disability office today the author messed up our usual boundaries soon to come by regular tennis in class in the Bible Time by rendering Services a devotees all that is troublesome to the Supreme Lord who is Transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact when we get up to Midland Michigan on Genesee
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance
my teachers are opening my eyes are the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's after Lotus feet from the tree Bob and Tom can't have seven chapter 13 text 23 but I think we're going to. I think we were just getting into 22 and we said that we were going to return to it they call him so why'd it on back when I get them back
 x22 the Ryan the Supremo downloaded this is python man speaking
 Yeah so here's a man laying in the dirt Transit Transit Angeles who was noticed not just like oh who's this on home. Man laying in his own you know mess it was actually a prolonged Mirage
is a great a Great Soul one of the mahajan's he saw him and said this this person here that's not an ordinary person and he started inquiring from him so now that they called the python man is laying down
 and he says the Ryan that he's very well spoken this I thought man he was on a mission for lot who was king at the time was on a mission this is this is the kind of leader that we need right you know I I I need to take a break and go off on a mission to just find weird people that are full of deep spiritual not vote for for president could do the job he finds this man lying on the ground
 he's well-fed although he seems like it doesn't move it all and he can sense this isn't real important this is going to come out he could sense this isn't an ordinary person there's something deep about these a deep thinkers to do
he's got some kind of knowledge that the rest of us don't have begun a car tell me you you know what are you all about what's going on here
 so you're so pretty to who is filled with all opulence is predominant within the core of your heart because of your being a. Avoid speaking to her a lot and he always drives away all the darkness of ignorance as the sun drives away the darkness of the universe OK Google he sent you most people don't understand me most people walk right past me and they say look at this guy just lying on the ground lazy
 dirty dirty but he's saying you kind of picked up that I'm I'm onto something special and that's because Lord Narayan Lord Vishnu is there inside your heart
 he's full of all documents isn't
knowledge she knows everything he's predominant within the core of your heart is in the Corvette everybody's hard but in your heart he's predominant because of your Devotion to him you're feeling him you're being Guided by him you're being enlightened by him you're being directed by him so he's driving away all the darkness of ignorance and you look at me and you understand what other people don't understand now now in the commentary show property rights this he says the Lord is situated everyone's heart
 any quotes East Warren sarber bluetana
 British 30-30 so that's a verse from the 18 chapters bag of you to that the Lord situate and everyone's heart and is directing them now this is something that I think when we hear that
 like it when I can when the Western might hear that God is in the heart of everyone needs to reckon them all well obviously he's just going to direct you right to the gold you know immediately isn't that what he would do right why would
he directs you anywhere else this site is a little different than that you know the Lord is situated in one's heart and when the Lord is pleased with a devotee of the Lord instructs him now only to the devotee only to the person that's asking for it right only to the person that saying God I want to know you I want to give my life to you I don't want to live a life of selfishness I don't want to pursue my own
 selfish goals I want my body my words my mind to be dedicated to you okay to that person only to that person only to the bodies however does the Lord give instructions by which to advance further and further in devotional service isn't of others to others he gives them a directs them according to their desire is that where you want to go
 okay like I can help you get there I will unfortunately unfortunately also their desires are tied in with their car
once you started back off from Krishna and he also told her just tied into you get back in the system and your system is filled with ups and downs it's filled with roller coaster rides wear as a person who's really connected to Krishna you'll start seeing everything of Christmas blessing and like no I get it I'm getting exactly what I need right now I'm getting a there's not going to be any why me going on the Y me Mantra will not be chanted any longer and it did I ever tell you about the time I got arrested spent the night in jail Runner not the time as a devoted before I was devoting my friend Andre Troublemaker he did become the head of the Church of Satan and of course to the New York Chapter just the New York
take us to get pictures of Anton LaVey goes to it so I'm not going to give all the details about what we're doing into getting approached by the police. And I kind of mouthed off to the cop that was dumb as y'all know what you deserve to get a little while okay so I'm out talk to a couple of it and then you know what they did they'd just love to each other instead let's put him through the system put into the system and so they just took us and they put it through the system you know they put us in jail
 it had to do with some they wanted they're asking me for like my dress and I actually literally didn't have fun and so I said I don't have one like that you know that
it's one of those kind of like Rebel Without a kind of things are you 18
 oh yeah and so then they said they thought I was kind of playing with them by saying they wanted me to dress like all these guys you know being problematic and then I probably said something else and that was it a list of Star Wars a fly on the wall wish I was a fly on that wall because it's good advice for boo you'd like to have been the external manifestation of the Souper Salad in like just tell him where it tell me you'll have a house in your situation respectfully thank you officer thank you I'll try a job I don't have an address right now I'm I'm I'm living between residences I wish I had an address to provide you I can get have something over here and my parents address is the last place I lived and I didn't do that I did that I did the
 that the Brando kind of you know
you were cool and you got to put in the clink have a home you got a problem with that yeah I know something like that all right so what happened you went to Rikers Island or something no okay the tombs tombs downtown
 okay Central Booking the koala but the point is we make a choice to rebell and then we go in the system and that's called The Law of Karma and an increase is the only one is Krishna this the part of my but she was old is the only one that facilitates anything that you want if you want to lick your hand the promises okay I can help you with that hand you know or I can instruct the Davis to help you lift that hand so he's kind of the overseer
 as well as the third the perimeter right this is bug of agita 13 chapter right who put the rest on a month a job are too both of my hatred of he's also the friend in the heart but if we say to him just like we've been talkin about that
at Weis parent right the parent this kind of like you know I have a friend who's a parent that
 was a heroin addict it recovered heroin addict and that had a child was a heroin addict as well
 and that friend said to me
 we're talking about their child and that your aunt said to me
 I can't help them I can do all I can and I can give them all the best advice that I that I can but until they realize that they needed I can't help them. You'll be off with them but I can't carry them exactly like that and so Christians kind of like that the par mama got in the heart is kind of like that is like is it if that's if you haven't realized yet that this material world is a big prison and if you're still captivated with the idea that I'm going to squeeze some enjoyment out of this place
separately from me from God then I will facilitate your desires in the system
 and put away that the system works as you get something of what you want but it also kind of grind you you until you can come to the realization on your own that I want you and the moment that you come to that I'm going to start to give you a whole another set of directions is going to bring you straight to me you're going to try and send the whole thing that's the material world that's how I don't think they do this anymore but when I was little your parents before you went out for Halloween and it's say okay I'll want to see y'all all the candy I want to see all the candy and the Cruisers is always disappear that there was some psycho on the Block that was shoving a razor blade in an apple that they always have people like that Mara can you add a razor blade Halloween
my parents are like let me see your apples so it was like I don't care how sweet what are the apples everybody loves we weren't so interested in the apples anyway honey crisp is delicious Honeycrisp apple and you're like I know this razor blade in there but I'm just going to keep eating it anyway it's like
 no you can never fully enjoy the Apple there's a razor blade in it or or another time you know what time I was
 cooking a big thing of soup and something fell off the shelf when I reached for a spiced it would be the glass shattered everywhere and some might have went in the soup and I was like how we ever going to enjoy this soup knowing there could be a Shard of glass in it so even if you got a bowl it's like Russian Roulette has nothing in it that could be one little and that is a mature World we're desperately
trying to enjoy the making a plan to enjoy the material world but if there's always some met with some pain that's even people who have everything going for them it's mixed with some paint That's the material world as it is to give up and when we give up on that system and just get Lord Vishnu system I just want you Krishna that's the way we realized there actually is something that the ups and downs of material nature very last in the suit glass shards in the razor blade Apple too much of an example because the razor blades pretty big pair to an Apple but a little piece of glass in a soup or did she come up with anything on that was it an urban myth yes it's an urban myth see that
okay nobody did so again now this is a really interesting theological idea we're going to we're going to tease this out a bit more rugged. Okay cuz it's probably said only to the devotees however does does he is instructing everyone he's instructing everyone in the heart but he's also again not trying to wrestle you until I come back to me now you don't want to come back to me
 okay alright we can we can keep you on the system if that's we got a plan for you so that he's mouthing off to the cops yeah you just stay here another day
 this is a great thanks to people who like mouth off to judges in the courtroom judge comes down on them and then the guy still mopping up okay and on another month and they're just so that our guides Us in the material world
so arrogant mouthing off to the judge mouthing off to the judge and then just like ruined their life due to their you know you know that it's it's it's the person's Eagles I'm not subordinate to you I'm not subordinate to you okay suffer more again I'm not so bored OK suffer more just YouTube search mouthing off to the judge and you have 1 hour of solid entertainment and education and education system another year now and then off to Lord Vishnu and I got this i got this work I'll figure it out I don't need you good Lord Vishnu silly silly rabbit just me and my ego silly rabbit that's a good one and only
Cody's however does the Lord give instructions he's instructing everyone only to the devotees however does the Lord give instructions by which to advance further and further and devotion service to others to the non devotees the Lord gives instructions according now this is important according to the manner of their surrender everybody surrendering it's just where are you surrendering to to wear to what are you Circle you surrendering to God the loving beautiful sweet let me embrace you welcome back. He's running to your senses to your mind to Your Ego will know I'm just doing what I want to do what you want to do what you want to do with your mind wants to do and how many times have we been in a situation
 where we do what our mind wants us to do but now we know is right we know I don't want to do this
but I'm going to do it anyway Arjuna calls it doing something as if I forced him to do something we know we're going to have to pay for practically immediately lost unless donates is Lester Lester only okay now one Prophet says two others the non devotees the Lord gives instructions according to the manner of their surrender he's a looting two-person bug of agita
 right yeah you tell Mom about 20 times the type of a double-hung Mama Garment of arts and Tay
 minutiae party service job as well surrender unto me every word accordingly every word everyone follows my path in all respects of Center for 10 so the whole thing you and me just back in the back of the back and forth like a whole entertainment we do everyday
 I'm sure we could be talking about you doing right now
so this is a calmative we're going to
 one of the wonderful things about practicing this for years and years as you go back to counter that you've read a hundred times over the past Thirty and you like I was speaking to me anyways right ok Google digging Wells now that makes sense okay so this is she'll probably don't even want to Swami
 writing on just how nasty algae that's different than the Western mine's theology
 that in one sense everybody is approaching God but they're approaching it in different ways everyone is searching for Krishna
 interesting right everybody is Chris is a reservoir of all pleasure and everybody's looking for pleasure is a powerful statement tell you everybody searching for Krishna in the different aspects of his manifestations I searching for pleasure in Krishna directly like I was
to reconnect and feel my own
 Blissful and undid nature or I'm looking for pleasure in Christians manifestation of this other body I'm looking for pleasure in the increase is manifestation of the impersonal Brahmin maybe that's what I meant sweetly non-sectarian is totally not to tarry has nothing to do with Christianity Judaism or looking through the energy it's unclear what religion you are or whether or not religious yet you're still looking you're still looking at everybody's lookin okay everyone is searching for Krista in the different aspects of his manifestations Chris the Supreme personality of got him now, but sweet baby girl and there's a supreme personality he is partially realize and is in personal drama Jojo If all Giants that's one part of him if you realize this God is everywhere
all part of the one that's a one that's it's all one if you realize that you're realizing part of him
 and he's also partially realized as the all-pervading Super Soul dwelling within everything including the particles of atoms this is all connected it's all tied together it's all moving under the direction of some Supreme intelligence now you've understood more of him but you're stupid everybody searching for him so now he said now he said everybody searching for an improper put in the context of
 krishna's different levels of his manifestations as impersonal Brahman Berlin Parma Bakuman this is an evolution from a mama but now he's going to go and he's going to show other ways people approach
 but Krishna is fully realized fully realized non-sectarian the saying this is true and that's true also and it's this is fully true
is moving in a Direction but Chris is fully realized only in his only buys pure devotees only by those who know him as a person consequentially Krishna is the object of everyone's realization
 and that's anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one's desire to have him if you don't want him but you want his energy in the form of blank whatever it is you are still pursuing him
 but it's just you're doing it in a different way in a way that's less realized away with less understand in a way that is within the system of his law of Karma and we're in the old be like the penal system you know it's many Joker a Madman to not even just what's the word that we always use and turns it's meant to recalibrate you have a one-week stay like in legal terms like with it the purpose of the jail is the Reformation conciliation Reformation Reformation
you to reform you to unwarp you right right okay and that now now but I think probably the next is going to take it out to the super esoteric level would ways are we approached him at everyone's approaching the different ways are you in a room with a cell not only could you not like choose your food in person but I'm sure there's not a wide salad bar of choices there in prison but not only that it's like you got to do with all the other stuff up prison the guy at your cell mate who's a jerk or beats you up about a cage away or horrible things that happen in prison
 go on so I wanted to say I don't know where you're getting this information from but thank you says the man who's never been there all my God one day downtown
Rick Sarah Dokken prisoner I'm not going like I said I did and I'm not going to bring you a burger or whatever or you imagine if you got stuck in prison some out like I'm just have I ever thought of that I think about that all the time about that all the time I think I'm trying to communicate because it down okay we got we got to get to keep reading the story
 okay in the transcendental World also Krishna reciprocates with his pure devotees in the transcendental attitude those that have the chance of dental attitude I love you Krishna I don't want to try to escape you I recognize that you're happy with what do you want for me where's the current going to happen
I'm just like a leaf on the river you just take me around and that shower and I'll give you that is I trust you to share. It is cuz do with you don't fully trusting and surrender it's going into a barber shop to put you got a big head of hair and you just put your head on the back of that chair and you say just do my hair I trust you okay that you said that I was but then imagine that the barber knew exactly how to satisfy you yeah yeah so probably write this here he says and the transcendental world not at the he was talking about what's going on the material realm people that haven't yet fully realized him and connected with him but he says in the transcendental everybody's connecting with him where everybody's coming with the transcendental attitude so it's super case with his pure devotees in the transcendental attitude just as just as
 the devotee wants him you want a sweet little baby Krishna.
8 lb 6 oz Krishna happy Easter to you as Christian as the Supreme Master another as his personal friend another as his son is still another has his love towards all the devotees equally
 according to their different intensities of love for him
 in the material world the same reciprocation the feelings are there and they're equal exchange by the Lord with a different types of worshippers so I'd like those relationships that we see here they're going on there
 the pure devotees both here and I think that was a reference actually to like gokula bring job and like he brings it down down here and displays the same relationships the pure devotees both here and in the transcendental about associate with him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and that's to ride Transit abolitionism
Service as for those or in-person List those as I don't want your person I want the piece that is your energy but I don't want you I don't want anybody above me I don't want to be out on anyone I want to think that I'm God as for those who are in person that's in who want to commit spiritual suicide by Niall dating the individual existence of the living entity Krishna helps also by absorbing them into his effulgence that's what that Moksha is that's a whole other class right there such a person as do not agree to accept the Eternal Blissful personality godhead consequentially they cannot relish the Bliss
 of the transcendental personal service to the Lord having extinguish their individuality but according to one of the great of Charlie is in our line and Mister Boy George bow down mister mister mister we say
I hate Sean some of them that these impersonal East who have merged kind of sort of into this a personal glowing apologist some of them who are not firmly situated evening a personal existence return to the material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities they are not admitted into the spiritual planets But there again given a chance Chris's cuz if you want them personal Braman okay here you go when you're dissatisfied with that was going to give you another chance right they're not admitting it to the spiritual planes but they're given But there again given a chance to act on the material planets see where it leads you put into the system again for those are fruit of workers those that want to try to enjoy the external things of this world the lord of war with them does the Lord warns the desired results of the prescribed duties as the Young Nation Cara
 and those who are Yogi's seeking Mystic Powers their award
search Powers so for the car me to get what they want for the candy they get what they want the yogi they will get what they want in other words everyone is dependent for Success upon his Mercy alone and all kinds of spiritual processes this is it right and it's right here probably sums it up and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path boom boom
 everybody gets what they want but it's non-sectarian it's like everybody's on the same path but you just have to understand that it's moving in a direction and has an ultimate goal they got some good news for you Pamela Pamela garland from Atlanta is very pretty criminal defense attorney to a criminal defense attorney by yeah we can get out we can get out yeah this does he work international like internet if I if I'm in Turkey Mexico
