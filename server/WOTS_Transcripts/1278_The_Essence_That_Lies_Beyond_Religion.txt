 all right we have Celtic a gnostic last day for Patriot members at 10:30 Eastern Time. To Recovery Group meetings at 12:30 and 1 and also in-person meeting this evening at bhakti Center
 is that take place in the
 in the evening I believe it's 7 or 7:30 but you can check back to your cover group.com for details nugget I think we did this nugget once before or part of it maybe not you're reneging the Nuggets I don't normally do that but
I'm almost sure it was another at least we discuss this at some point in our history but it was a long time ago and in peace and I think we didn't do like the whole thing this is like a long one but just kind of popped up into my world this morning and I thought I had one would bring this back out I like people use three names I like one named people like I like rock enough Batman Madonna you know I like one named people with three new people is pretty cool to George Bernard Shaw David Charles Wilson David Mayer Simon's Jones David Lee Roth
 oh I'm sure there's plenty out there okay so this way it's Georgie Eisenhower less than an inch of the initials anyway John Quincy Adams is more popular to do this maybe was at the old days
 your question no I'm
sucking three names George Bernard Shaw after Shakespeare he was like the most influential writer from England's here pretty sure that's a little I know
 hey when there's things that everybody know and you don't know them right now nobody knows what we're about to read right now right now about to Enlighten them with something that I just took off the internet okay this is the way this is the true Joy Of Life the being used for purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one
 the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrapheap the being the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little quad elements and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy
I'm of the opinion that life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can I want to be thoroughly used up when I die the harder I work the more I live I rejoice in life for its own sake life is not brief candle to me it is a sort of Splendid torch which I have got a hold of for the moment I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the Future Generations a word for not sure I like that it sounds like George Bernard is kind of identifying with the body in the sense that he thinks this life is it well yes I got it but they're still of use of value the first thing that comes to me this is the true Joy Of Life the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one you know if I sometimes pray like this because
 you don't know
what's the fuel used to have a friend that use you someone use you for your money so when you use your for your fam someone used you for your body with this concept of being used or he used me it's like it's like a horrible thing someone reduces you to a thing that they can enjoy it it's it depersonalize as you but to be but I pray Co Krishna Use Me Oh Guru Maharaj o Krishna how can you use my body my talents my thoughts my dreams might use me that use me and I will feel appropriately used not just like used
 for your own selfishness someone else's selfishness but for God's intents and purposes he's purpose for God's Mighty purpose I love that
 what else are you taking what else I'm taking a here's another thing sometimes we think like we get caught up in so much business of the world
 and not
the busyness of the World by busyness of the mundane world we get busy doing nothing I say that a lot busy doing nothing and then we feel like the remedy for being busy doing nothing
 is just to do nothing we start to think Leah busyness is bad it's overwhelming I need personal space I need to put up boundaries I need to do nothing you need to do something substantial something that's contributory
 right here so it's not the opposite of doing too much nonsense is not to do little nonsense it's do something substantial so he's wants to he wants to be fully worn out when he dies but it's not like he's saying okay now I'm just going to cash out I sold all my stuff at I've got out of the corporate world climbing the corporate ladder and then I'm just going to go to Panama and live on a beach that's how we saying
 it's busy
busyness to your lap I want to die
 preacher preaching at you know what preaching the word preaching I stop saying it for years it's back in Vogue reach
 okay okay let me share that thank you you and it seems like he's kind of you know it was interesting and in our meeting yesterday because we're we're trying to Define our core values and in doing that we kind of looked into the podcast itself and say what what is it that you're trying to embody what are the essential things that are there one of them had to do with it being rooted in the tradition you know that the authentic party tradition we want to present we want to present that as it is something real something authentic make sure that gets a crossbow we also wanted to
 be sure that it's sometimes when when tradition is too tightly
 interpreted
and it doesn't actually Reach people are become transformational year for people so we wanted also to be Innovative and you know Branch it out so that it's relatable and then or principle we looked at when we release it what are we all about what is it it seems like he's touching on it here but this is what we wrote as focused on the essence keeping our mission at the Forefront we avoid Divergence such as not constructive criticism Godly been polished nickel slow not constructive criticism we avoid not constructive criticism gossip gossip and politics and policy is it doesn't mean that we can't have any political convictions but it just means that we don't get diverted into the in into them again maybe non-constructive constant back-and-forth
 that people are very prone to get caught up in particularly in these days of 24-hour
start new Cycles in all of that so in the worst political climate you can become very Krishna conscious you can't even if you hate your president if you hate your government even if you're sitting at a prison well hopefully you don't hate them. But if you don't deal with your your government it doesn't mean it's a disqualification for me Krishna conscious know what he's saying here is he saying I could have a choice either I can I want to be clear when I read this I keep saying okay and part of a mighty purpose how I'm part of that might be in a very small way I might be in a way that people don't even notice it doesn't mean that you have to be this writer that everybody in the nation knows and whose Fame goes on for right away she has a bigger than life that's a yeah but but you're part of something That's mighty even in your own small way so he sent I have a choice to be part of that to take all my energy and engage in a way that's meaningful and that makes me feel
so good that makes me feel
 there's a certain value in my existence as being met it's not being lost or squandered and how do I squander it hehe I think he kind of got to the same kind of things that we're getting into right he says instead of a feverish selfish little Claude I have it and let you know any said of ailments and grievances complaining that the world we would he says like this will not devote itself to making you happy will you say the world's not revolving around me right in our whole body flashes actually it's all revolving around 1 Dynamic principal now this is the part that holds your book and that principals a person I will let is this another person and I have just as much right to be in the center of that thing as anybody else actually don't and that's okay
because it's just as thrilling and wonderful to be revolving around that that the Divine Principle as it is to be that it as a matter fact that in this is the whole theology behind shoot your tongue is that Divine principle personal principal in the middle realizes that that the experience of revolving around that principle is even more ecstatic than being that principle he wants to take that role of Sri Krishna takes that role as she cheat on you that's kind of an esoteric I like the point though and holy places we do Pottery chroma, to means Two Step around and so the idea is that all these things in holy place is whether it's a sacred Tulsi tree or a temple or go over downhill or even tailoff they all have like their Trails you can walk around the idea is you're getting yourself out of the center now and you're walking around these holy things or places it's really good example use because you feel a certain power like just like
we we both just recently covered on right and externally if you just look at it first well most of the time you can't even see the governor may be half the time and we're saying that that Hill is not an ordinary Hill that Hill is entirely Dynamic spiritual Divine being in that pie by symbolically in one sense we rotate ourselves around and we walk around the thing we wrote do a pair of footie walk 24 km 14 miles around it as an act of a sudden I was inactive like meditation but if the Sim there is a symbolism in it that is like I'm putting you in this and I want to revolve around you and we do realize we do feel tangibly
 that there is a powerful force you know they're there there's a there's a powerful effect effect that has on one's Consciousness I want to go to the house tomorrow
right now I have had said had someone's life I would hit you know when I interpret this in a Bucky framework I can choose to be a fever selfish little cloud of ailments of grievances this is going wrong I got to build with to make me happy this world is not meant to be devoted to making in one sense the world is devoted to making us happy but we have to learn to work with in other words it's not meant to make us happy on the material Level but it's going to turn us back to the real happiness the Senate is suffering that we that we experiencing life is meant to be to have a Reformatory kind of healing in a romantic kind of realize oh I've been a selfish Clyde in this doesn't work what's the alternative and the alternative is to be part of that Mighty you know principle that Mighty Purp
which is divine love and we all have the opportunity to make that yet but we will get diverted if we're not very careful it's a week to find it in our way I think his ways more less saying the same thing he's very particular reform school reform school for school where in reform school in a sense we are so anyways I think he hid out a nice you know it's you want said to just kind of like a bold statement about how I want to burn out on it you know on the battlefield and in you know go out in a flash of glory and it myself but I think he he was very insightful and terms of how we lose focus you have excavated the previous nugget which was worthy of recycling recycling you up cycle the Nugget and I think I don't think we got that whole thing
are in in a lot of that was set up some pretty interesting stuff go to another good person like George Bernard Shaw with three names Linda Linda Linda Linda says alright the Ryan and the musketeer on that I'm shaving my pocket I'm witches are very means of Conquest what should a speculum agencies to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan Rishi the super most human being until mother starts watching the goddess of learning and she'll be asked today if the author not stop radiation about Reese you need somebody by regular temps in class was about the time in service of the beer devotees all that is troublesome to the heart we can eradicate it and loving service to the Supreme Lord who has praised the transcendental songs we established as an inevitable fact
Cameron Diaz
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer my obeisance he's at their load of speed-reading for the shoot my bag of the times can 27 chapter 6 text 26 or 7 or everybody at the d.c. temple cluding Robin they having a big grand opening if you're in the Washington DC area big grand opening of their Temple Potomac Maryland none of her down as one of our age group leader she's one of our Sage good leaders to senior Vice should be Temple president that had both residents and married to our good friend right behind the surname graduations event
 we're going to drive right by I wish we could just pull over and stop or we're not going to you could
now go ahead do it I was 15 hours before when you said okay so 26. Just he's kind of them he speaking to his little friends he's got all these insights in his kind of like shattering previously held ideas I think this is new for them to set you know that they've been fed cert information they're they're all little lives right and and he's kind of cracking it do you know it in and he's he's speak it almost sounds like he's speaking against the good Pious reasonable kind of life
 you know, Arthur, Moksha that these four are seeing as this is this is this is for the people that don't go
of course this is for the people that want a nice safe path that moves in a very favorable pies religious way
 and he said that there's these steps are helpful for people that are really lost but when you want to get to the deeper true essence of life you realize it's beyond these and end in it must be sitting there saying that where did as a matter of fact they're going to ask where'd you get this stuff we never heard this kind of stuff or who did you hear this
 stop in this is not your ordinary five-year-old playdate
 Dona Martha common Moksha religion Economic Development and sense gratification
 are described night of milk
 these are describing The Vedas as tree Varga or three ways to Salvation
steps moving towards you I was a big thing and beta teachings
 ask a question about that this weekend too so we can see what a day or three ways to Salvation within these three categories are education and self-realization ritualistic ceremonies performed according to beata conjunction Logic the science of Law & Order to look in that translation but that's what I'm assuming it's referring to in various means of earning one's livelihood these are the external subject matters of study in The Vedas and therefore I consider them material however I consider surrender to the Lotus feet of Lord Vishnu to be the transcendental I think they were again they had not heard this kind of talk before that this was going Beyond
they had heard it's apparently emailed a very young age are being trained up in this time okay
 and so they're wondering are teachers
 they're going to say a lot we've only have these two teachers
 and you can't even leave the palace where did you get this where do you get the stuff you have but you know as I'm as I'm hearing it you know what what conversation is reminded me of what was the very fascinating conversation between shoe Tanya Andromeda is Roy said that that this is from the charge which is the book that really captures this type of chaitanya vaishnavism right this this this bhakti tradition if the stems from shoot you Tanya and in that in that biography of his which is more than a biography right it's a it's a book that dust hell of his life
in his travels but it's also the whole thing's peppered with
 the refined philosophy about the details but it's like I could say I love will you love what or I love my mom I love my kids what does that actually mean and so they charged him read it gives refined understanding of what love of God is really understandable way although it's infinitely deep but it's also probably the most essential teachings out there with the fact that you and me a couple couple losers from the Lower East Side so there's about five or six really important conversations that he has the fence if I call you a loser
Diamond In The Rock in the Lower East Side so one of those conversations is he goes to South India and he Encounters this Ramen underwrite who's has the absolute deepest realizations about bhakti and so they have a conversation in which SRI chaitanya who is Christian himself is becomes the questioner and he gives the position of the answer to his devotee and he's saying your answers are the most incredible answers no one else could you meant he say I'm just speaking because you're making me speak this way you're in power and me to speak this when he's encouraging tell me more and more and so he begins with the simple question you do like describe for me what what's the highest what are the high school what's the high school in life you know where is like men to go
 and he begins on this in one sentence about answer but not for someone who's looking for deeper essence
right so he begins bye talking about Dharma right that if one follows the Dharma really well in life that leads to the really good results right and that's cool you know Dharma and how Karma response at right if I'm if I'm if I was just thinking about that I have to die sometime when I die while hearing the bug so it's so he could have you ever had a conversation in the person just staring off without blinking
so so so he at the end of this is where he starts he starts by speaking about Dharma that there are rules and society and that if you follow them it makes you a better person and it brings out the good in you would protect you from from wandering off in the wrong direction and it serve Society so it's selflessness it's is a selfless act to say I'm going to be a good father sure I'm going to be a good husband I want to be a good mother I'm going to be a good wife I'm going to be in my business dealings I'm going to be at the coil and bring something good into that world you know I'm going to I'm going to be very conscious of whatever laws on prone to and counter them through Dharma if if I if I have a tendency to go towards greed I'm going to counter that through giving charity if I have a tendency towards arrogance
 I'm going to counter that through acts of humility and that's all laid out
in the in the dharmic text right so that's where Robin underwear began and she just sent me us but give me something higher give me something gets more to the ass and he climbs up this ladder of teachings that come out of the Sacred texts that keeps climbing up until he starts to start talkin about your body right now actually giving your your heart and soul to devotional service okay that's getting warmer but keep going keep going and then be up to the point of the very special box with the love of the residence of Robin that they have for Krishna because that is something very special something very moving something you know it's an esoteric idea but it's it's it's getting to the deepest essence of existence anything are you getting some of the keep going you know it gets to the love of the Kobes that this did the intensity of their love there.
the complete
 I'm loving surrender if they are in their devotion is is is particularly special now you're really getting somewhere keep going he gets to the love of she might be right around here that's like a bill to that here do something similar going on write a lot of things were being taught about be dharmik and you'll get good results from that the economic development, you'll enjoy life you know be cut but in this in this dharmic way and it is, your desires will be fulfilled and ultimately if you follow this path directly it leads to Moksha where you let go of everything and you enjoy some peace and he's saying he's not saying that these things are really saying these are on a lower level what did he say I consider them to be material yeah I consider these are external of the study and therefore I consider them
Ariel however there's something beyond that there's something that gets more to the essence of life I consider surrender to the Lotus feet of the love Lord Bishop to beat transcendental right and we never sort of got caught up in the baddest most of us never got caught up in a bit of teaching so yeah we just met a devotee who is a body of a down to you know devotees that were this is the goal when we just were taught just to jump onto a devotional service that's the way the truth and the light yeah it's it's this is there and Bug of agita where where are just work Christmas instructing on Juna let go of that these flowery teachings of The Bays that a promising you happiness in this world there's something beyond that and you're worthy of what's beyond that I don't know what Plata is doing here's the exact same thing he's saying that it we're getting trained up in a certain way we can go beyond that there's something want those are just kind of like rudimentary steps
nonsense I need a huge steps for if our society lived it would be a tremendous like it if it was selfishness in and recklessness in life but that you'll even save the last few days I'm on this these verses like we can't even hold together a family and Kelly yeah right you should have stayed on the regulate us and have us you know curb our desires for unrestricted sense gratification and we can't even keep it together you know it's it when you need to hurry up we will have to say it's a really interesting example that you used to know it would just holding a family together whatever what what is it that causes so much
 attention dissension you know fracture in our relationships suffering in our world if we go back to George Bernard Shaw all right we're not not only are we
not all feeling part of some higher Mighty purpose but we're not feeling part of a higher multi-purpose that's unites us sure and and so we become these clods because we watch films we read books we we get impressions in her mind that I meant to be enjoying life in a certain way so like when we think of marriage perhaps we have you know what years and years and years of childhood development watching what a romantic relationship is what it what it want the kind of happiness and excitement that is meant to deliver which is based on his Carlos to stay in the message board I me and mine yeah I want to be happy for my marriage I want to be happy having kids I want to be happy having a home and it's still based on even how I can enjoy this instead of like I'm here in reform school I'm here to contribute to something bigger
family unit is part of a bigger Mission and because of it there's like I'm not getting my needs met and I'm coming into this relationship with a bag of desires and needs an expectation that will never be fully Mad like they are in the movie like exactly and so here I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole Community that's not like a necessary like a socialist kind of statement on the on the on the existential level there's an important truth in that right that that we're all kind of part of one spiritual family that are in our happiness happiness that we aim for should be on that spiritual level it means I can operate in a in a selfless way in this world my marriage doesn't have to be about me for filling these desires have been implanted in my head by watching movies my right eye that can't see myself as a servant in that marriage when everyone comes with that service added
then we're all revolving around that Center in a smooth harmonious way but we suffer so much because we did because we have these it is it's deeply ingrained if you just ask anyone on the street you know like in general were trained to think that this world is meant to move for my happiness and the end that's why we become these beavers claude's a quad so so so it's pointing to this higher this idea that Beyond working well within the material he sent we've been given these laws of how we can operate well within the material Realm
 but there's something Way Beyond that and now he's going to get today
 okay text 27 personality God had a well-wisher and friend of all living entities normally explain the transmittal knowledge to the great Saints Naruto soda
conversation has been happening yet you do you know what stage level were for your in the if you have no clue what he's talking about right now it's like I don't either at this point they were stories within a story-within-a-story like that that's what the bottom of a darts with with
 with suit goswami speaking to the sages and I'm sure unless we open a chapter 11 is Suitor is telling about the conversation between super Dago Swami Maharaj. So that's his level to get another conversation had between Mara and Linda Linda Linda and I want that conversation and they're like oh this reminds me so we're sort of like a Dream Within A Dream Within A Dream right and so then the then what pseudonym goswami is describing them
Cricket is a conversation between Narda and you to steer that's what this entire Canto is the 7th cancer is Nara to speaking to you this year and end Narda is telling him the story about prolonged speaking to his schoolmates but not is actually going to become a character in the story now that's interesting right he's
 talking about someone else talking about you yes such an extremely difficult to understand without the mercy of the saintly person like Narda but everyone was taken shelter Bernard has two siblings who session can understand this confidential so you know we can't assume past that because recently here's the point on the trailer he goes that
 this text is not that you just what is it a day should do or
how do I unlock the doctor right that they should do it but we don't understand these higher truths simply by opening up the book and reading sure it's dorla bomb it's very difficult to get to get you know if you've ever been to one of those book stores on metaphysics and spirituality and you open up one buckets like what do they mean by that and you open up another book it's going to contradict what the other one just said you go back to your book on crystals has how is this thing spiritual Hammer I was an amethyst spiritual you know but anyway this is no idea they helped the money and then I'll send out my beautiful purple stones did it work you know if those have any flaws in them
and they can have the opposite effect and give me a Florida discount
 but the point is that these texts the tradition always the tradition we don't read about people that just read the book and became and like we read about learning it through teachers are teachers that represent it not just teachers that teach it academically teachers that embody these teachings and convey them it's always learned through that end in a sense interpreter is it interesting to not learn but where you can study bhakti but not from a practitioner people that know it detail dollar study it's like learning cooking from a person who doesn't cook or snowboarding by a person who never snowboarded you have to do live what you're teaching
or else you can't really pass it on and it and it's important for so many reasons there's an esoteric reason why supported chikhli when it comes to body is because the whole face is there that it has it's a very personal it's been given a is it gives it and that's the only way that it comes it it only comes through people you can't say I want to get an about you but avoid other people yeah I want to purchase it can I talk to you can I get it on Amazon just is received and that's one of the reasons why a bogus mommy says that is very rare cuz you you received it it is the way you can send you through the association of people that have it by now wakenden them right Prime talk to you and so and so here's that he wasn't so that's one reason that sets an esoteric reason why it's important he was a practical reason why it's important that we that we only learn this through people that know it
embody in a t-shirt I was recently speaking to like a group of yoga is that a yoga teacher training where I was online it was leaving and I was purposely leaving a little dinner, but now that is a big deal or anything but
 I was asked the same question like about 4 different times because people nowadays are very concerned about the social implications of these teachings or I'd like another word if you read something about Karma will does that mean that we can try to do anything for anyone as well you know if someone has some unfortunate circumstances you're saying it's their fault without identifying the dresser and and so you know I was explaining that within the tradition where the teachings of karma come there's also the teachings of compassion and so so so
can't pick this part of not apply to Berkshire and in order to get that you have to get it you that's explained through the teacher who sang Don't Miss interpret this don't misuse this this is always engaged in a spirit of compassion if you don't have that teacher that's a size in that you could take you could take an intro all kinds of conclusions from that you could misapplied in so many ways but you have that person that embodies that embodies the entire thing and that helps us
 keep focused in the right way helps counterbalance any misinterpretations helps bring out the answer but it wasn't satisfied cuz they asked me can I have about four different times because it's not saying it's such a like people are growing want to learn ya didn't want to understand that's a good thing and they want to question why
it encouraged in the Attic discourse but it's what is it when they have their feet planted in the ground of this is wrong and I'm here to defeat you like you're not here to learn anyting I felt I can't say because it was zoomed in all that bad but I felt some people would definitely like okay I got that satisfy other so I can't say for sure whether they were just totally dissatisfied with the answer not if someone already have their conclusion made up some you know if we can get in the whole psychological analysis that right but some people feel the need to and bod to I am the person that the other end and they may not be willing to hear anything because they Embrace that as their identity they may not even be effective at it they may not even invited the true Spirit of it but they've they've created an identity around that and when we create a false identity
and it can very easily block us from our true Progressive thought you know yeah so any case he's saying you know here it's saying that it must read it again that such knowledge is extremely difficult to understand without the mercy of a saintly person like Narda but everyone who is taking shelter if not as disciplined succession can understand this confidential knowledge the more we study our own spiritual life reflect in our spiritual life is people on a regular basis who have spoon-fed I spoon-fed because it's not Mama feeds a baby you want to take this food a little spoon Paris party and also it's like they don't shove it down our throat they gave us as much as we can put in her mouth and digest as you would people like that who is giving us bhakti maybe we would not understand it
 if you just pick up these books and try to read them on her own now now he also the term here the translator confidential
that and that's that becomes important but I think it'll make him out the next person we re 2828 Admirals continued I received this knowledge from the Great Sage Saint Bernard amoni who is always engaged in bhakti in the Postal Service this knowledge which is called bhagavat Dharma is fully scientific
 you try it you do it and then you get the results right it is based on logic and philosophy and is free from all material contamination okay so he was just saying that this other knowledge is on the material Level right the door Martha, Moksha he's saying but there's another kind of Dharma there's a deeper Dharma Dharma that's that that gets to the deepest sense of life and that's called Bhagavad darn right. That dorm of that that that in again we could look at the word Dharma right then we can Define it into Waze
it can mean it can refer to
 the purpose or the duties that we have in life right my Dharma is to be this vehicle for this time in my life you know to be a good father that's that's my purpose is the purpose of mine it's a duty that I have in my come out in particular there might be particular regulations or something that are all responsibilities at the find that Dharma and Dharma out the board is also meant to to refer to something more fundamental than that something more sensual that which means my Essence right and that that is something that doesn't change with time doesn't change with circumstances that's that by my Essence at at my very essence I'm up a Divine eternal love her deeply connected with that Supreme Source right there that
but the essence and so here soon is a bug about Dorma what does a Dharma Beyond being good in this world and receiving good results from it there's a Jamba that connects you to that live on Bhagavad Dharma that's it he saying is fully scientific it's real is it there's you can understand it makes sense logically and philosophically it's very strong in those areas it's it's not something that's in entirely really does make sense doesn't it it makes sense makes sense and so anybody at all if anyone's got any issues it's not with the philosophy it's always like the place we make sense unless you don't want to hear it but it's it's consistent solid it's the Yeah Yeah Yeahs now he he's he's calling this Ganem is this is confidential knowledge some you dumb
have you get Gannon which means this knowledge here we're going to translate his comprehension I was some attempt combined with it is now is combined with his practical application the groom's realize now I realize now Edge yeah and so he's saying he saying this is something that you can apply your your logic to apply your philosophical thought to it holds up this is something that you can apply your in your life and it goes beyond just a theory and it becomes deeply realize and it's confidential because it speaks to that most essential message of of of divine love and end one could say whoa
 if it's confidential it's right here in the book what Woodhouse secret or confidential is it it's not hearing it it's not confidential the sense that nobody gets the chance to hear it except some exclusive group but there's an exclusive group is capable of understanding it

What teacher he talked about the sons of their the sons of secret area after all we're children and they are our controllers for you especially who always remain within the palace it is very difficult to associate with a great personality to your friends most gentle one would you kindly explain how it was possible possible for you to hear Narda where do you hear how do you spell our thoughts in this regard her this one but not it doesn't come in to run because she poops Palace does he live around here so it's so this is a question this question is going to lead to the entire next chapter
 a lot is going to tell us how he met Narda but interesting things here to is
that dumb did the the kids are speaking to tilt a lot and when they speak about him if their words you know they're they're meaningful and papa tom is kind of like framing out all these meaningful statements right so he says dear friend most gentle one
 would you kindly explain how it is possible for you to hear Narda so in one sense where we're seeing the very polite little sons of demons they're very polite they're there protein in the mood of a disciple and I believe that sense right its Faithful Is respectful but they mentioned this through the word here Sonia dear friend most gentle one now if we go back to the very first chapter the very beginning of the Volga time the sages and I'm sure on your are confused right there they're all gathered there's they know you're liberated beings they were not ordinary been sitting out like fishermen and what their

big sacrifice of chanting mantras you know burning fires and a chain of matches and stuff and and then when they realize we're not getting there I say we we need to hear from the right teacher and they identify suitable Swami is that teacher and and they open up to my I pulled up the verse here they said
 they were they open by saying your senior amongst us your senior you got more experience and in nobody understands all of his teachings all of this vast Vedic literature of the baited upanishads they accept nobody understands better than you understand that you're like a black belts here but and then they say this and because you are submissive your gurus have endowed you with all the favors bestowed upon a gentle disciple isn't it interesting missing is such a dirty word
