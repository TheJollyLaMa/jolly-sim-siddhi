 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages of daily spiritual podcast with your host Rocky Mount and co-host and Senior educated about the Centre New York coast stupid ass welcome to the show welcome to the show episode 1394 Got a Feeling we may be in trouble like this mommy or something
 that was a Emerson Lake and Palmer
the name of the song with welcome to the show
 I'm doing good I had a great evening last night
 me to do not to one-up you like I think yours is as good as mine then
 me and Maryland for ten mile bike ride so not sure if you're aware that really do you say I know but I don't have a swing you got to make a little swing there come on we will we should make a little sore and make it part of your nature is hold onto your seat if you're new to this hole. It's different on different is music for 5 days for 5 days we take those
 images deities dolls whatever you want to go
we put them on a little swing and we swing them we swing with a little rope it's in the smaller than a meditation when you get it it makes so much sense if you don't get it and you're just looking in it's bizarre but I think I think of is that it's maybe bizarre but sweet is nice to everything
 so for me was like this is weird this is not cool I've never seen anything like this is far and you know that was just a projection oil and I think it really depends how you get into all this stuff and a part of me didn't want to accept didn't want to hear God's call didn't want to end it because was so different internet back then maybe I just kept objecting objecting objecting the pro
was everything started to make sense otherwise is that was the problem on my face and I love it I love it I love it you know because I'm trying to wake up really early every morning and do my work on this book everything I've been avoiding going to like the Thursday night kirtan cuz you know if I get home at a quarter to 10 or somebody I don't get to sleep until about 11:30 or so you know and then I can't get up at 3 little wine down and you know yeah so it's so while but yesterday I was just downtown at it was like 6:15 or something and I was always Thursday
 I'm just going to go over to Thursday night here in town and I didn't even realize that was the first night of Julian yatra but I just sat down there that cared
and you know cacia was leading it's like the new generation we used to talk about these to go to Psycho they're going to be really great some date that day is here there are top-notch I mean the kirtan that he led was just all I all I've been looking for it and it was a sweet and he just kept it right where he needs to keep it and it just kept going and we are all just so you know
 do you know who drowning and surfacing in in in discus you know River of of just beautiful Blissful kirtan a man in the Box in the last 5 years or so you're in such a good place to get into it tears your predecessors enjoy yourself on the beautiful bhakti path man it was and then and then we all brought little beautiful
Little Rider murlidhar on the swing and it's just great you just feel like him
 is John in a way where I don't mean to be the critical here but it went but when it's not about the person leading the Cure time for when they're singing to to engage everyone together in Remembering and hearing a the names of Krishna when that actually happens
 it's really powerful you know it's it's it's it's like it's cathartic it's it's beautiful it's satisfying it's it's it's really it's a spot
 did Maya sing all my attention I was in there the whole time shouldn't sing but I was mentioned in
 that shit her voice is on her you know what high level now so it's like that
ananta is Caseville is leading with his his uncle and Aunt is still kind of like playing your dumb and still kind of like you know you're not in the show yeah and so he'll just say okay get that microphone moving around you know so like other people lead for versus something like that and then then fighting the first person who said her you know like Maya you know and then they gave me the microphone and she just delivered I think it was beautiful and I responded to this Maya ghost of all the Cure times are for everyone obviously but if you do have that natural ability to sing very beautifully
 just let your you know don't get distracted by everything else use that and offered to Christian to all the to devotees and you can really have a smooth path that you know pay for you like that to hear something funny
Sammy from youth of today is always sending me these text messages like to play on a new shelter record make a new shelter record musicians I'll copy some of their cure tones and I there's like something you might just like culturally and I send it to them and you can't help but appreciate and love good music yeah yeah I'll get them shelter record put them on a Tracker since Sammy climbed up on the Rath yatra car he's getting all kind of what kind of inspiration I'm helping with juggernaut
 okay what's going on

 that's where all the progress really starts to know that's what are you I've been to different cities than traveling around and with some devotees from our community and in the middle of the conversation like I got to have a safe trip meeting
we're having dinner there very committed to their Sage group tomorrow so instead of emailing us questions you can also submit questions on our new platform if you go to community chat and then questions for the house we will poll questions from there and read them tomorrow for the sage group signup.com will be wide open
 and then also added you in a sage group. That be a fun group
 out who I'll join yours that was me that everyday
 also on Sunday we have a problem. Disciple how are you and beloved member of the dynamic Krishna bhakti movement
fantasy will be interviewing him about his new book right that's why he's got a new book out clothes tonight and Darwin publish on the penguin press is also the father Genevie Harrison yeah and Tulsi
 and their brother little brother too
 beginning right now I know it but it slipped my mind has got such a powerful spiritual Presence at you know it's in front of her husband call the deep and I stalking there's like three or four of us together and said yeah oh yeah and then you know what that happened at Genovese wedding he's like I was there too it's like being in a family with like if you're a fan in a family with a celebrity for that it's like you know
what is a traumatic it probably is probably maybe that's what your family's been gone I mean like I'm talking about when it's just sort of like and then you don't feel like we got to live up to him and Bob Dylan son was in a band and that's sort of big but not you're not getting it doesn't matter how big You Got Tonight by Bob Dylan and I bet that really does a number on you
 well they say Tyrone is going to be more famous than you right and they say that that Rocco is going to be like the the big Guru Julian Lennon that's another one out there athletes who like LeBron James his son just got in the league but you know
 wiethop
 and it sometimes like to get bigger
it was then I met sometimes they do get bigger than their parent that happens sometimes Kirk Douglas Michael Douglas Kirk to Michael Douglas get bigger
 I don't know probably pretty soon I'm going to make them better person sometimes there's like three people in the family that go huge and then like
 and then one that doesn't at all but about that that is enough to put you in a psychiatric couch with perhaps that's like Venus and Serena and then I think like there's another sister I don't know if there's that family but there's other families that are like that that's why I'm saying that unless you have
acknowledge it can take a torch you unless you have that knowledge the whole material world is torturous
 yeah this is a note that one down right there unless you have knowledge the whole material world is torturous
 hey girl
 all right does that all the announcements Mare
 what crazy I don't know if nugget is it really the right word it's like bigger than a nugget
 you wish me a sure well I did look to the right and see that you wrote Paris Hilton but I was like was did she have a famous sister she comes from the Hilton family yeah that's enough to make a little nuts
 so we've been talkin you know about the inbox how we've been reading about
the instructions on householder life
 and it keeps going back it's funny right but even notice it keeps going back to serving out Prasad I'm beating people with this food that has been offered to God first and to buy food
 I was thinking it's kind of like
 like if you're in a grocery store
 you can look around and see all this so much nice food in here but you can't just pick it up and walk out of there with it
 without reciprocate without some sacrifice otherwise you're a thief
 I like where you're going with this and now and she can't be if you steal from the store you didn't create that food you didn't grow that food you didn't have to give something you don't have to grab something otherwise you're a thief and so the ideas as we move through this world we didn't create the food
 all right just got to be some say
device is God that's great we're in God's house like we're talking about being in Taylor Swift's house so that they would this is God's house it's his energy he built it it's you know all his stuff
 and it's Kylie being offered to us like we're guests in it but it would be uncouth
 not to show some appreciation otherwise we're just like you know imagine someone comes to your house and you feed them every day and they never even said thank you they never even you know it's like you know like please you know the food becomes sanctified
 it becomes even it becomes body has this way of taking material energy and in one sense spiritualizing it by connecting it with the spiritual and it said that anything that your Consciousness that your awareness comes into contact with that has been spiritualized
it's spiritualize your Consciousness right it's it's if it lifts your Consciousness up and transforms your Consciousness and food is the most fundamental thing that we do eating you know it's like we do it everyday we need to do it just to it's not like this optional thing right is this most fundamental human activity so in the box of tradition the ideas that we take this we recognize all these beautiful lovely tasty satisfying nourishing
 ingredients that were given for food we should prepare them with love for the person that gave them to us and offer them back and then enjoy them to your heart's content I don't worry about being attached or anything like that we don't even worry about that it's like be attached to this right it's like it's it's it's it's a purifying and satisfy so that ritual of cooking
is love offering with love then eating it with love we don't even call it eating it right what do we call it is and how fortunate we are to receive it that daily eat cooking and eating in that Consciousness transforms you powerful way so we're going to talk more about that and what we re today but I pulled up a little some conversation between Laconia goswami who we had on the show Once. He's a pro pot in New York City in the sixties and the Beatles to get into Channing Harry Krishna you go cuz I have a conversation with him and George Harrison talking about we call the Prasad Prasad I'm literally means
 the mercy of the Lord at the mercy of the grace of God so this food is called like the
Grace right through the mercy of Psych it's that bud prasada Prasad on and that's that's what it's called so this is a mukunda he says at lunch today speaking to George Harrison this was an interview from like I think down in the early eighties he said at lunch today we spoke of a little about Prasad I'm vegetarian foods that have been spiritual Eyes by being offered to Krishna in the temple a lot of people have come to a Krishna Consciousness through per Sodom especially through our Sunday Feast typical saying and Hari Krishna Temple is on Sunday there's a big program in this big Feast Day Feast at all of our temples around the world I mean this process is the only kind of yoga where you can actually practiced by eating George says well we should try to seek out and everything so it helps so much having the having the food to taste let's face it if God is in everything
why should you taste it when you eat I think that Prasad mm is a very important thing Christmas God so he's absolute his name is form for Sodom it's all him they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach so if you can get to a man's Spirits sold by eating and it works why not do it there's nothing better than having been chanting and dancing or just sitting and talking philosophy and then suddenly the devotees bring out the persad him if people show up with buckets you said it's a blessing from Krishna and its spiritual important the idea that precise Adams the here we go we talked about this yesterday the idea that precise Adams the spirit is the sacrament the Christians talk about only instead of being just a wafer it's a whole feast
he said it's a whole Feast really and The Taste is so nice it's out of this world it's undoubtedly done a great deal towards getting a lot more people involved in spiritual life beside and breaks down prejudices
 it's best because he says
 percent based on Prejudice is too because this the editing is this little screwed up he says people think old people think I think he's saying people think oh well yes I wouldn't mind a drink of whatever or a bite of that then they asked what is this and they say they were spotted always pursued them and then they get to learn another aspect of Krishna Consciousness then they say it actually tastes quite nice have you got another plate full of seen this happen with lots of people especially older people I've seen your temples maybe they were a little prejudiced but the next thing you know they're in love with a Sodom in event they walk out of the Templeton
not so bad after all
 Interstate we used to get prashad before we were devoted to you and I we used to get prashad on in Tompkins Square Park cuz I swear yeah we were just sort of Tupperware over there maybe I didn't do that selfish the living entity is your hates I'm just taking it by going to while I like this Indian food I'm going to go to 6th Street and go to Indian restaurant and it just wasn't the same food and it seems as if the entire betak path is to broaden our entire Consciousness to start
creating everything here is created by God from God we are sort of made up of the mercy of God and even when it comes down to the most fundamental thing the thing that everybody is doing everyday multiple times a day that's from God to and every time you open your mouth and shove something in that pie hole. Remember this is all coming from God yeah that thing for that Spectators there and also like he was saying the kind of the spiritualization of it like the Eucharist I do is there to write they're both
 it's about this my appreciation for my honoring of it and then also that you know if I don't know anything about it I need it it's transferred his transformation to the cap likes when I used to get up that Eucharist it was something special go up open your mouth and putting something in your mouth feel special
seeing if we were all sitting after chanting and dancing and they sat us down I just gave it a condition like pavlovian recipients. Okay mukunda continues we're going to go somewhere continues he says the Vatican junk The Vedic literature has revealed that Prasad and convey spiritual realization just as Channing that's just by eating the food you get spiritualization he said you make you make spiritual advancement just by eating it then George Harrison replies I'd say from my experience that it definitely works I've always enjoyed Prasad a much more when I've been at the temple or when I I've actually been sitting with prabhupada. Then when somebody's brought it to me sometimes you can sit there with precise Adam and find the 34 hours have gone by and you didn't even know it was sad and really helped me a lot because you start to realize now and tasting Krishna you're consciously you're conscious suddenly of another aspect of God
the mechanic says now this was back in the early 80s he said we served about 150 million play to Prasad and so far at the free Feast around the world what to speak about rest since we're talking about how this Prasad and distribution this food the food is such an important part of not only this culture but the practice of Bucky and that's something if you added up
 billions of plates a Saturn that have been distributed following proposed order its you can I don't even know what like there's this was a decade ago they're Distributing just in Mumbai in the midday meal programme was over 300,000 plates per day or all of India it was in the millions per day so I mean it's billions and billions and billions of classic Hindu Dharma durai that's it.
downhill at this place in the day we're just really didn't know what to do and I'm a little hungry let's go into the village get some food and some of his hands us a plate of her shot just a regular regular devotee Temple NADA iskcon Temple met a Harry Krishna regular Harry Krishna Temple and its exchange that receiving of the love the giving of the love that makes your day magic and if we can sit down today with that meditation when we're if we're preparing the food you think I'm preparing this for Krishna and I'm going to distribute it with the devotees it back of your conscience as a preparer how powerful will that be today and it's ideal way of sharing locks right it's an ideal way of sharing loved but instead of thinking I'm cooking it for this my family and make even if you don't have an older make a mental altar
I'd say I'm offering this to you God and then I'm going to offer the remnants The Leftovers to everybody else if you do the cooking in your house that Christmas this is a sign right now A Christmas speaking through me speaking through your medication today refine your cooking one notch by making it a direct offering to God and then think about I'm now going to distribute to the devotees and it's magic stuff alter your house you could set up a little picture of Krishna Krishna dances for you a little plate for no one else has got a little altar in the back there and every day before he gobbles something down his pie hole
 he has a lot
play the food that you offered me and Terri were playing chess yesterday and I'm a set of Mara shows up at the altar and she's offering something on the Altar and doesn't that affect that I mean that affected me to see you she kneels down before the altar she puts a little play it out and it affects the Consciousness witnessing the devotion witnessing her devotion and I felt like I'm about to eat something sacred now and yeah that's right lane is a very beautiful indeed creation of God and the devotees and the creation and let's face it wouldn't life be a little better off if we are all a little bit more appreciative and grateful you know as I'm thinking it's the so many examples I can think of but just a couple like you know when you go to the Radha Govinda temple in Jaipur
 it's like this big huge open area right
yeah and thousands of people literally
 all singing this in their devotional further ambulating yeah yeah and then you can go off to the side and you can purchase some Prasad him write sweets especially that have been offered to ride and Crystal are on on the on the Altar and what people do is they don't just go and buy for themselves at that Temple what they do is specials they going to buy it then they just go stand out anywhere and they just start handing out in crowds just come around them in there just like here some for you some for you beautiful loving exchange everybody is connecting you know one of my favorite things is to going to go over down go over downtown or one of the towns around Guilford on find a lot C shop shop by a bunch of sweets boxes of sweets then I go and stick over downhill a nice romantic beautiful with this guy
and I put some Tulsi on all the sweets and then I tell she leaves the special holly leaves and then I walk around with a box of sweets and start Distributing to all the Pilgrims go around over. Help what are more satisfying things you can do in your life I think we should do that on our on The Retreat on the Steelers ever going to do everybody do it you got to stay with a stick to protect us from monkeys baby monkeys
 I was thinking just one more example is you know another three pin in my poor West been gone this holy place you know are my pores like in the center of it and you can get on a boat and go up in about
5 minutes out the gunk are you still in love with you we can you come to that Village mom got she
 and there he passed away now but there's that beautiful devotee jugged bundu he was when I knew him to act like 20 years ago he was in his mid 80s
 and he had when he was a little boy like when he was 8 years old he's grew said you should stay here and always serve in this Temple it's it is a temple that goes back five hundred years in our tradition or something like that and and he just a there's a simple simple man that just he never went to Calcutta and saw the city and ever watch television you never did he just lives in the jungle in the simple little Temple very holy place and just just worshipped in the temple and greeted anybody that came and when you would walk in there he was at that place in his
 elevated awareness that he loved every one you would walk in
and he would genuinely greet you with such love even though you never met him before he was in the first thing you do is you bring you right in front of the altar sit you down he had like these them like in India the rice comes in these burlap bags so his mats to sit on we're just like these old rice bags these old burlap Rose you like a reclining chair that's what he had you know he's afraid to put in his mind he was offering you something really nice out here sit down here you know that he had to clean rags and serious for clothes and and just and then he would sit you down so you sing for you sing 44 route in Krishna and then he would Apostle and he would like to start to grab vegetables in running to this lady had this like kitchen was just a pit in the ground with some like old dented pot a new start to cook for you and then he would sit you down
he spoke no English so he was just he spoke no English but the love that he had for every living being was very powerful and his natural way to express it let me cook for you I'm going to cook for Krishna and a few the prasada and you would feel it's so profound that you know you know I think it's people have to experience that meeting sodders devotees who have that desire to love and serve and it changes something in you you're like a lion sound for his you run into people like this yes it does something to your heart sort of recalibrates your heart and we have to take it too seriously once we get that taste for it we have to be that person that when people come to our home we are making them feel so welcome so loved and that's a huge part of advancing at bhakti some people come to you
 you make the
feel like this is your home, can I serve you how come whenever I come to your house you always making me sure a starving I always do great at your place
 Christopher who got enough Spirit yes she does all right just think about food now means of Conquest what should I respect labason season
Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan treat you the Super Bowl XI when being on to other saraswathi the goddess of learning and just wanted to ask you to the author that stopped radiation validation that you're going to say that bag about you too much lucky bacterial genus sticky a regular attendance and class is in the bag of Tom and The Runaway service De Pere devotees all that is troublesome the heart would become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with Transit at the songs will be established as in a revocable fact home again it's a bit on this truck soon as my AC go to bed when I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are open in my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer my face since he's at their Lotus feet read it from the srimad bhagavatam Canto 7 chapter 15
 yeah text Canto 7 chapter 15 x 7 entitled instructions for
civilized human beings
 does that include us if we're acting civilized you could be uncivilized in a moment I've been there have you oh yeah uncivilized mean senses are out of control doesn't mean like your dress you can you can think you're well I'm dressed up very nicely now that's got nothing though it's not just what's happening externally it's what's happening internally that's what real civilization is what's your mind like a lot of times were very clean on the outside but inside the dirty I already defilement defilement as the Buddhist say it's true it's true
 at 7 maybe we could just meet with revisit the other ones real quick just to set that cuz this is what it said read text five said when one gets the opportunity
 of a suitable auspicious time and place one should with love
offer food prepared with key to the DD the Supreme Lord and then offer the prasada to suitable person of ice number or Brahman of this will be the cause of everlasting Prosperity spiritual press. I still love you want you to offer Prasad to the demigods the saintly persons ones for Father's the people in general one's family members one's relatives in one's friend seen them all
 as devotees of the Supreme personality who died at this is just by giving by serving in such a nice way by loving everyone you seen everyone in connection God is cultivating that right
 show picture of you with your Tupperware we see my deal was this
 when I first started getting into it seriously yeah there were three programs a week Monday Wednesday Friday at Greenwich and Greenwich Avenue
so that's four days myself back then right now to look at you
 and then and then there was president that certain days he'll give it out in in in the park so you almost had like a full week there and but you know you do with that Tupperware then you're bringing at home
 you just survived yourself of that and we did I continue sorry to interrupt
 go ahead G I interrupted you interrupted you like
 meat eggs fish in the Shroud house ceremony even if one is a tria Don McLean it would be allowed for them to hunt and eat the meat no slaughterhouses that's for sure
no it was easy that's for the same here even charge you shouldn't do this if they want to be up to you always
 he himself should eat and should not eat such things with a suitable food prepared with Gigi is offered to saintly persons the function is pleasing to the forefathers and the Supreme Lord who are never pleased when animals are killed in the name of sacrifice will yeah so it's so hard to hear is clarifying things that may have been misconstrued from previous text like in The Vedas and he said if you want to take this to the higher level you are their sacrifice but not this animal Sacrifice by the way we're going to speaking of that which is in the Bible you hear animal sacrifice now we're going to talk to we're doing the interview with the vagina get the Christ spiracy movie have you nail down the date for that yet we're still working on a date but it's happening so it's saying here you offer this nice food there should be no meat fish raise the shradha saraf
is a ceremony that's done for the benefit of of your forefathers have already passed away in the ideas that how this food is so powerful that if you prepare the food with the Roshan offered to God they become spiritual eyes and then through ritual you offer to your forefathers so no matter what state they're in if they've taken birth here or they are whatever they're still getting that and everybody is meant to take care of their forefathers that way now some of myself what a ridiculous superstitious War than think about the mental even even if none of it's true you know what I'm with you here like I'm doing this to benefit my ancestors how broad your mind becomes an end and then if a cat has on you like that that that you thinking about your own where what's my destination due to the level of my Consciousness where am I going
now the next verse recognize this is a real this is this is anyway let's just read it it's it's so important. Dharma different
 how do you say it different different levels of your spiritual life, reflects the very beginning of the Bible time when my suit against wanted was asked by the sages and of dime is trying to what is brings the highest good to mankind what delivers complete satisfaction to the self he said sub I poop so for all Humanity Hutto Dharma the highest Dharma is bhakti that well I'm not just going to cook for myself I'm going to cook for my entire family so the beginning of cell the beginning of spiritual life is a selflessness
you're starting to care about other people besides yourself and then when you start to realize like I don't know if there's a God but you know how your order of the universe and eventually you're starting to engage in a practice where your refining your spirit to let you know I got to learn to forgive people you know I'm at first I was just going to be careful what I put in my body I got to be careful what I put in my ears and eyes and nose and mouth I got to be careful cuz what is animal beings to what we're doing is The Vedas take you to various new on levels of evolving your Dharma or your spiritual connection there is a supreme one there is a highest one and when I say like we're out there and all those guys are down there we're still working on it to okay so it's it's not meant to be a sectarian statement
 as anything but it's anything but it's because you'll find that part of Dharma across the different spiritual traditions
right it's it's it's not saying this religion but it's saying this realization and we should realize we are Works in progress even if you opted in okay bhakti
 if you're opting into your body Pap expect that Christian is going to start putting obstacles in your life for your evolution is he cares cuz he wants you to he doesn't want you to sit it's nice to take a bath it's a good thing to take a bath right it's if it's soothing to take a bath it's it's clean to take a bath of your dirty you don't want to sit in the same bath water
 for a week I was her out the bath water you got to get rid of the bathwater you got to get some new you always have to upgrade the computer to newer operating system so you're going to find even on your back you pack on a regular basis or ask time to upgrade its and it's going to be tapping you on the shoulder on a regular
cases and you're going to go
 it is time finally have to accept yes it is time going to click that button it's time to upgrade the operating system and stop hitting
 never see this message again or remind me later to stop hitting that button remind me later how many months do you do that
 how it started for a second
 persons in one Advanced and supreme Dharma Dharma are advised to give up all Envy again animosity are in relationship to the body words or mines
 there is no Dharma or religion Superior to this that's pretty powerful it's all right there right yeah
 giving up MB that means I'm happy for other people's happiness I'm I'm sad for others
will success we're not trying to create agitation between other people I'm not trying to take people down on a regular basis I'm not but my mouth is not filled with criticism or fault-finding for other people I wish people well I wish people spiritual connection
 I don't Harbor resentment in my heart for other beko joy in someone else's suffering and humiliation
 and you don't need Olympics is this woman that did this break dancing for Australia you know I really worked hard I tried my best. I felt bad I felt I felt so so bad for her you know that she did she really did her best and you know maybe she wasn't so great that it fights you know she went out there
the Olympics where that's my goal
 Olympic Dental different but yeah but it's a lot of that stuff the gym is could just crush it now but any case back to the store
 just but it's the kind of dominate the summer in the Olympic Cena but but in any case this word envy again you know that the more archaic meaning I think especially the meaning of proper conveys when he translated is animosity
 right ND means in the air in the animosity person who wanted Vance in the superior Dorma
 their device to give up all animosity of other living entities and then to clarify how we have to do that is it it is not as I call okay I won't say anything bad to other people or I won't physically
do anything but there's a thoroughness for the yogi it and they use this model where they consider the money he did these are the worst measure money in the mind vock the words and Kaya Tressa the body body mind and words you don't that's a Ascension you can say or refining the bills. Send a message to speak at the first stage right that's the first stages I'm not going to physically stop the person that I that I am feeling animosity towards so I need to root animosity out of my actions that's great if you do that you're on a great start but you got it but deeper even what you say you have the root animasi out of everything that you have to say that means you're not saying terrible things about the woman from Australia who is in the break dance contest you not that's not where you go free to try to
 yeah you got nothing like that to say nothing so
and with those words right so considerate with your worth and then but still more in the most subtle of the most difficult you need to root a riot out of your own but that's really where it all goes as it's a mind is really what we're most concerned with so you wrote it out of the your actions with your body you routed out of your words you route all animasi out of your mind and heart is saying here that there's no Dharma Superior to this time right now you're completely capable of
 seeing everything in relation to God you know
 yeah yeah yeah we're Morrissey we are friends
 why can't I pick up my having to Marcy
 it's like people that you know people that maybe you have an edge over them and all of a sudden they get become they become huge and it just like
it kills you it should have been me it should and people go through their life like that should have been me especially if you were very attached to the outcome you know what I think we're going out this is a great exercise for us all
 a place of focus is where this gets put to the test a lot is what we allow ourselves to participate and nowadays it's especially online but it can also be in our conversations with people but when others are being when there's some hostility when people are speaking with hostile each other living beings do we join in that Spirit of hostility
 do we join in a fun do join in at just to get you no get our blood boiling do we join in it just for entertainment you know or two or do we refuse to participate even if we can't like stop the person from doing it to
Louis internally say this is not for me this is not what I'm going to that's a good practice next time you hear that like people collectively digging in or online online first of all get the hell off line on Facebook things you're not convincing anybody of anything on Facebook stop that stop wasting your time and everyone else this time don't even even go there but ya can't can we say even when people are collective can we just say you know what this isn't for me internally said this isn't for me I'm not going to support I'm not going to know what people actually respect you they'll seal I code out and yet is what it's doing is teaching them

I'd like to think I want to hear that. Like what is it about me what is it about me that makes them think I'm willing to participate in this a better deal with myself but that's it now we're talkin vaishnava right that's like that's like high-level thinking right there right when they can just like people like you know like in our own life no one would come up to right now so I'm eating start spewing some of the kind of stuff that we might be amongst ourselves and how he's not interested in that right I'll just I'll feel like a fool if I begin to talk like that people should feel that way with us how to speak on safety
