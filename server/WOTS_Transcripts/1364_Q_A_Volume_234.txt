14 year old Prophet Joseph Smith Joseph Smith's yep Tabernacle Choir by the way that's a shame America late to me tell us about the guest the guest is Alexandra tear soup otherwise who initiated name is Barcelona Barcelona Priya
 this is an amazing person you know she's she's one of the top filing a separate generation you know she plays it all the big concert Halls you know classical music she's so you know in a credible just another level of talent
first seat in Mike I'm going to say it wrong the Russian simplest perceived as a soloist
 isn't that sort has ever seen others I think this fellow seems like even beyond that you know that they don't forget safety The Soloist like stands up what does a solo
 what is a soloist do during the day tomorrow around like she was a little girl you know like hurt you but she was born in a family of buck to Yogi's of devotees send people I can write yes and people like neuron Jenna Swami but a hurry for Boo and rottenness I'm used to visit her in her home and visit her family and they encouraged her to follow her Musical
calling and make her life an offering to Krishna and she's just risen to the unit to the top levels and Inter inter field of classical music so I will hear about her life but will also hear about what it's like to bounce that life of Bucky and then being in in her particular career which has allowed to travel a lot of you know a lot of all kinds of people each hand down his it with our first question my friend before you got there I was going to say it is also ties in with what we've been talking about all week with your self-discipline because imagine if the amount of discipline it takes to become that level of a violinist you know so she can you are such a credit to a previous life
 which I guess was did he have to do the discipline well find out from her how much does a sad to you know the type of discipline that
and if people just excel at things even you don't even martial arts I found like there's people that just come out of the gates that are just very good they're just naturally strong naturally athletic naturally tough and those people who are disciplined and they got good but it's just a harder path and so probably people like her they've been disciplined for lifetimes
 yeah
 and she's probably going to devote in a previous life cuz you're born in a family devotees via can you get pretty good, I meant you're a you're a musician you're an author or a part-time botanist what more do you want
 he's getting quite good with his part-time botany a pretty good pretty good surprise people all the time is it
but yeah but question time do you and I do like very good I hope they were name to live up to
 maybe it's their way for covering up yeah baby was sarcasm yeah he's probably a good man and I really the first question for the host post that would that mean what that means is cuz now we have questions on our platform at wisma pictures of condos in the chat area there there's one thread
dedicated to ask a questions and his was the first on the platform as you don't have to write Miss Mara anymore it was with the website in the past we always have that on the
 and people with writing it on Discord so now the Discord have we have we bury Discord now I will shut it down. A bear that we should shut it down and communal you want to it's like rushing now they threaten our village cuz it's like taking everyone from the little village and put in too much nicer Place we've relocated always are always for their benefit we should relocate know what's best for you okay Linda says there's hardly any post over there anymore so I want to get crazy on that message board myself forget about that message for her
are there any buddies over there nobody's paying any attention much love and respect to both of you guys
 the continued help and support I've been thinking about this for a while okay when is Chris Goodman is there really good and bad, yes there is I could easily have seen for example trauma years of drug use and things I've been through as bad karma although admittedly a lot of trouble was due to poor choices but if I shift my perspective I could also easily see it as all of all for my edification right notification music are our purification or growth
 if I hadn't gone through all that I wouldn't if I hadn't gone through all that I wouldn't be where I am right now with my family a dream job where I get where I get to support other people navigating drug and alcohol use and like some good karma yeah I love people
either jobs
 maybe I never would have been her maybe I never would have heard the holy name and now here I am 5 years in recovery be bag in hand it's exciting isn't it
 okay so that was good, then no so what because I'm here now
 I feel like it's just as easy to see the pitfalls of someone's Good Fortune when you zoom out isn't it all perspective and a follow-up question of this is all just prospective is it or is it all just perspective my pants up today
 follow-up question here's a follow-up question is there a trick or a practice or perspective to try to consistently see our struggles as being a learning experience or for our betterment or for our betterment
you're allowed to correct do I say something wrong when I say something right you can't correct me how about that let's make that the new rule but you said it wrong did I think I did that time okay that's a good one
 all right if he gets it he gets it
 okay he's not try to bargain with the universe okay I need some good karma here I'm going to do some Buju give me a mugshot to a demigod so I can overcome some bad malefic Planet cuz scuba help me out here worship some deity some gave us some Devi so I can overcome some Misfortune so I can have a baby so I can get a good wife no no no no no no no no he's taking a zoom that perspective even the bad things in your life once you apply Krishna Consciousness they all become a special guess is that amazing Chris
Consciousness is auspicious what's the Sanskrit word for that customer what is it Shuba Shuba Shuba Shuba
 biggest shubha auspicious auspicious nectar of devotion for the ideas once you add Krishna Consciousness to your life all the bad things become positive things wonderful things sweet things you know the story of my book about be getting beat down and have the books open and beat up by a gang of people with baseball bats and it's the most spiritual experience my life how can that be a mixed number to Errol Spence nothing makes material sense here and he's noticing that
his drug abuse is bad choices without those things he wouldn't be where he is now he's smart to see that so yeah it is they're good, and is there bad karma in the in the zoomed-in version there is you can be born say sickly unhealthy in a poor Finn a poor family destitute you get cheated you can get betrayed you can know you don't drive your car off the road you get a car accident it's all bad, we're not looking forward to that right now going out of their way of saying I like to break my arm today is just things happen that's called Bad Karma but when you can put a spiritual Twist on it and which I think part of the second question then you see a Divine hand in all of it and all will have to ask is oh my Lord
 what am I supposed to learn from this oh my Lord what is this what you want for me so that what
do you want how do you want me to grow with this or as he puts it was all edification was all for my edification I think is very nice spiritual perspective
 cuz stuba trying to get that term is looking it up but I haven't found it yet
 it's okay it was like trivia
 which a hat does a good things to know all our spacious okay yeah you know I think it was since there's a semantic aspect to this right if we just switch the terms from Good Karma and Bad Karma to Pleasant Carmen unpleasant Karma
 but it's all good right it's all good from another perspective you see he said he said this he said he asked is that I feel like this is just just as easy to see the pitfalls of someone's good, when you zoom out is it all just perspective
yeah there's an objective reality about what the law karma is and what the law of karma does
 but we characterize it according to our perspective so from the perspective of the criminal or that lets her from the perspective of the convict
 the prison is bad right it's his suffering because of it from the perspective of the victim of the crime
 the the prison is good oh thank God that guys in person you know cuz if he was wandering around out here you know who would be in danger you know when we look at Karma
 you're even even from the perspective of even from the perspective of reality from Clear perception we could still characterize it as all of karma as either good or bad because
 you know like you have the
 you have what is it
you should punish a dome poornamadah help remind me dumb you know this fascinating invocation to the really important Upon a Child write it down it's a very cryptic verse you do own poor numb
 it's a really poor numb he dumped or not from that hole
 this not even front like that that wholeness this wholeness like you know from that which is hole
 wholeness comes from it or anything that comes from the whole is is completely whole
 and then the second part of said and even if you take away so much from that whole it remains whole so is trying to describe the inconceivable potencies of of God
 and so but it's saying that God is whole God is complete and everything that comes from God including this world including the world we live in is
Fleet so that sense it's not bad it's it's it's perfect as it is just like a government has a justice department is not the Ono that's bad that's part of how it works it's part of what makes a complete is that it has that aspect to it and it plays it important role so in one sense both good and bad karma or let's say both Pleasant and unpleasant, are good that they're to rectify us they're there to help him prove us to help her if that's a good thing
 from the perspective of the true spiritualist they also look at it is all bad both Pleasant and on, but I don't want to operate within the realm of that law I want to drink and that law so yeah I don't want to be in the world of good in bed the world of pleasant and unpleasant the world where I'm getting automated reactions to my actions because I haven't directly connect myself to the whole
 so
I want to transcend that in operate on the level is called a Karma where it's where it's at my exit even if I act in this world there's no reaction because I'm not acting from a selfish motive I'm acting in wholeness with the whole you know what I think Chris is as you mentioned this kind of caught on to it that's that yet even the bad karma is good from the right perspective it's it's making us better people that's giving us a chance to become it's helping us to become better people it's his spiritual life is training us out of victimhood ultimately
 into
 into the realm of Selfless Love right it's all just to what it was our quote yesterday or nuggets yesterday where it said like there's only one plot and that is
Consciousness Consciousness trapped in it in a vehicle based something worse is consciousness trapped in Eagle Bay self-interest gradually becoming free so yeah so we're we're we're this Consciousness trapped in a false ego with a false idea of what our self-interest is and when we operate according to the false conception then there's karma is there a particularly unpleasant Karma the pleasant, rewards us to act in harmony with our true nature
 and the unpleasant part of karma what people called Bad Karma is actually making us feel the pinch making us feel the pain when we act in ignorance of our nature we act against our nature or when we act against our self-interest and so
hey Nikki on the charger from The Message Board very good 26 these are the six symptoms appeared emotional service you ready for one Class Act bhakti destroys all misery shubhodaya its most it's rarely obtain train cuz you conquer Krishna sudore LeBron's difficult to obtain Moksha Yoga Crypt makes even Liberation seem trifling
 send Rolanda Richard, my body is imbued with a condensed superlative pleasure 6 Krishna car SHINee key is capable of even attracting Krishna devotional service is the following
question is there trick or practice or perspective to try to consistently see our struggles as being a learning experience for a betterment
 that's right it's just drilled into way we think that their stories you hear Queen couldn't eat the all the stores at the bottom time I'm mad but hearing you're saying that I'm just hearing these things by hearing them you drill it into your mind that this is Christian's Mercy while and you'll be like oh I'd like to be like yeah it's Christmas Mercy I think you use this is what I was going to say two is here is trouble and like I remember when we did that 5th hundred episode and it was like 2 hours of testing him 200 Juneteenth
1500 East hundred road 500 500 you can see if it's hundred is there such as if you take the sets of hundred to tell me professional keys at all right I'm wrong no no no no I remember we just like 2 hours of testimonies of people saying by how by hearing srimad by with time every day through the podcast
 how to change your life and change your perspective and help them see the challenges in their life from A New Perspective and therefore growth through them and so yeah it's hearing and it's reflecting right we have to hear this he had a key. Kim just got to be no breaking it this is this is the the the how practice works is that you do it you do it with the right attitude you do it
over the course of a long time and you do it's steadily without interruption like on a daily basis and the guy we practice becomes firmly rooted and then you begin to just see through new eyes so I became created everything yeah hearing every day and then reflecting on what you heard as you go through your day to just like when you said someone said you used everytime I suppose that's Christians Mercy that's then helping you reflect me to text me back like this is all connected don't forget that
 mistress Mercy okay let's hear it let's go to the next question yeah this one okay
 Adrian
 why I question
I've noticed in our community who haven't heard from Adrian in a long time and never answer ask questions question is about Christian let's do one at a time he's already got a lot of questions under his belt and I was getting more I can get into for one here questioning first question is a question about Christmas six Oculus has Mara
 Fame pronunciation
 you can read for the knowledge may be cut out or something oh yeah Judy Fame
 strength pronunciation well
and knowledge he does just have those he has them in full we have them in partiality we have a little bit of beauty and Beauty Fades with a little bit of money. It's just it's compared to all the money that's out there it's just a little a little bit of strength right Krishna has all those qualities in full the even owns your money you think you got some money cuz Shiva Krishna opens it if you don't own it, okay all right you can't keep it okay if this is representative qualify to representative
 Hari Krishna so he says he is all attractive because of his six octopuses but what if a devotee isn't attracted to Krishna for some of those qualities like wealth and what about that brother
are we supposed to find it attractive that he's wealthy or that he's famous is that supposed to impress us some way
 follow y'all Tractive mmmm-mmm digestion that she's all dressed but what if the body isn't attracted to Krishna there will be something that will be attractive about him
 you know I think Whoever has any of those opulence has we become attracted to it you can't I don't think you could make those things so likes if someone's Rich you're attracted to them
 everybody is not just me everybody's like they're interested a person becomes interesting in their eyes
 that it doesn't mean they like you
 you're repulsed by people who have tons of money some people are
maybe that's their issue have there are three different checking their issues their wealth wounds on other people
 okay alright I think I think I actually deep down it's it's their attractive but there may be envious
 what do you think about that let's let's listen I think we need to be careful not to equate them
 with their mundane reflection right like those Christians wealth and then there's the wealth of the material world that's a good point to it there's there's Christmas Beauty and then is it cuz he could have just as easily said Judy I mean just because someone has physical Beauty and I like it sounds like he's saying well that's that's attractive no matter what but well that doesn't do anything for me but it's almost like he's sizing up like a date or something like that you know yeah it does
matter to me whether the well through the famous but I want them to be like physically attractive or something like that but krishna's qualities this is really important
 Christmas koalas are not different from Krishna
 and Christian is the reservoir of all pleasure
 Sean Krista manifest is opulence has and you experience them you experience the deepest pleasure and the reason why in this is so you know there's a there's a statement about about God you know
 which is out Russell Visa right that indeed he is Russell meaning Russian meaning it is a very deep word but Russian means like the flavor it means like juice or like the flavor and end in in in the Realms of devotional Aesthetics
 it refers to like the field that do you need
prepared translate it as Melos right the unique flavors and experiences of the varieties of love and so when it says Russell Vice aha it means Krishna that is at his Essence that is what he is is he's one who's tasting and giving flavors of love that's that's it when we think of God that's so we need to think of when you look at a picture of Christian you look right into his face try to understand his heart look into his eyes and try to understand his heart and his heart is just like I'm here to give you
 varieties of taste of the deepest love and as soon as you turned to me and you're you're ready to receive it I'm going to give it to you and I'll taste it in relationship with you the rest of us are then this is from Krishna book in devotional Services Raza is the volume medium or the basic
symbol for the exchange of the dealings between the Lord in the living entity Russa is also described in The Vedas Russell Vice of the Supreme Lord is the reservoir of all pleasure all the scriptures including the Piranhas The Vedas do punished as a novena to suture teach the living entities how to obtain the stage of Russia now if we can connect with Krishna and an experienced him
 experiences Beauty experience his knowledge experiences power experiences renunciation experiences famous and so on we will feel Bliss not just police but will feel the Bliss of his love through those conduits experience that through another being someone else's power Fame often it's the it's to flex their ego and it becomes the whole thing becomes ugly eventually warped reflection it's a war Perplexus
or perverted reflection if you want to get back to yesterday show
 you see if there's love in it then Fame becomes meaningful and not just superficial right like we might say okay like David Lee Roth is famous it doesn't mean like I find him attractive you know but like imagine your own child who you love
 Sunny find out they become famous
 then like there's a sense of wonder and and and something in the heart swells right like that the heart begins to swell it home I love you know the deer love the love of my life has become appreciated widely you know your heart begins to expand you know swell with love so it's the love it's blended with these qualities weather today in whether it's wealth or any of these qualities that you feel and you feel in a unique flavor
all attractive it will suck you in like it's not the superficial wound superficial Beauty superficial Fame now this is something interesting this is from a commentary proper road to the cheat on your charts and Rita Avila chapter 5 test 41
 improper right since the Supreme personality of God has absolute his qualities are not different from him something difficult son is going to take years of pondering thinking about trying to understand reflecting on hearing more about
 his qualities are not different from him we may have a quality and lose the quality him he is that quality that quality is him
 his form names qualities and everything else pertaining to him are as spiritual as he is there not superficial material come and go things every qualitative expansion of the absolute personality is identical with him
 since the absolute
the personality guided is the reservoir of all pleasure
 all the transcendental qualities that expand from him are reservoirs of pleasure
 this is confirmed in the scripture known as the Brahma Tarka which states that the Supreme Lord hurry is qualified by himself
 and therefore he's qualified by himself he doesn't we need to get Fame we need to go out and get it from someone else he's qualified by himself right here these are all him
 let me get back there
 the barometer the bruma Tarka states that the Supreme Lord hurry is qualified by himself and therefore Vishnu and is pure devotees and their Transit qualities cannot be different from their persons in the Vishnu purana Lord vishnu's worship with the following words let the Supreme personality of got to be merciful to us his age
distance is never infected by material qualities right none of these are Monday and quality in the same vision of piranhas it is also said that all the qualities attributed to the Supreme Lord such as knowledge opulence Beauty strength influence are known to be non different from him this is confirmed in the Padma purana which explains it whenever the Supreme Lord is described as having no qualities
 it should be understood to indicate what mirror Hot Seat
 are you listed I say it again
 okay this is also confirmed in the puddle of piranha which explains it whenever the Supreme Lord will come across many versus especially in the upanishads it say God has no qualities right so when at whatever it is said that the supreme law
described as having no qualities they should be understood to indicate that
 you know the answer I am it's a Brahmin to Feldman's you say God has no qualities qualities so what does that mean her devotees of Krishna how could have got to have no qualities is that offense of how does that fit in with our fellow it's true he has no material quality that's right this should be understood to indicate that he is devoid of material qualities but he has Spirit, protect our religious principles all Noble and Sublime qualities are eternally manifest in the person of
and devote isn't transcendentalist who aspire to become faithful also desire to possess such transito qualities it is therefore to be understood that Lord SRI Krishna the transmittal form of the absolute Bliss is The Fountainhead of all pleasurable transito qualities and inconceivable potencies so when so when you hear about Fame and wealth in relation to Krishna it's not like David Lee Roth's fame or Donald Trump's wealth it's it is it is the very source of all attract into this it's it is not different from Krishna it is entirely spiritual has none of the superficial short color of material wealth or how about this one more attracted to that wealth of this world or that power that beauty of this world and it not only emboldened their false ego and emboldened hours
you like that well because we want that wealth as well and then in that and that of course all those things are very they're not ours all those are filters are not ours they're loners it selects on loan to us my beauty is on loan my fame is on loan David probably Rob is not so famous anymore I can't fill a Stadium Nightclub baby all these things are temporary in this world and they said will know I'm going to die rich we're going to die it's not yours so they're on loan to us they won't actually give us what we actually want the only thing those are real it's a reflection we're tracking the actual possessor of all those things and what happened to wealth and Beauty are false ego diminishes
 because we understand that all the great like little mini well many beauties that we have it's Christmas anyway sweet we shed our foe
and I mean time Krishna is it is entering into reality now the other types of attraction to Wild Beauty etcetera opulence it keeps us more in the glue trap of Maya volume for sure that's not me I think maybe we could get diamond David Lee Roth on to the show what it was like to lose that money
 how is how you feel about it now
 I think it's like a postman now I'm serious. Joe Rogan deliver your mail my package is wet
meaning of t o's and that's great for him I think that'll be a good job for him it's a good luck good job yeah I mean I think it was David Ross in my life songs no I actually had a heart attack and he came and saved my life
 I almost had a heart attack when I realized it was a really rough and I had I saw I saw Lee Roth on his name tag
 but you got in there you're not David Lee
 oh you know he was supposed to be on that tour with kiss but they dropped them out yeah it's sometimes like bad, really drive you to being an EMP refer to David Lee Roth is being past his prime that's well I mean to talk about the pot calling the kettle black
a bunch of like 80 year old guys in makeup and high heels
 the covers Van Halen signs through the second half of 2020 to his unplugged that's the kind of thing you just Google direct David Lee Roth the ncaa's train he's a visual artists working and painting and drawing with a theme of social commentary is also a martial artist in 2003 he maintains a residence in New York City LA and Tokyo in 2004 he trained as a state license EMT in New York in 2012 yeah he said he'd probably had over 200 911 calls in the last six years he was at your candy blow your kicks away where I mean he was like really
Sirius Radio
 it's gone now it's okay that he kicks hot either when I went to LA
 I knew a person who was getting hair extensions a girl what I knew that hair extensions who is like a place in La hopefully for many places but but she's told me so I guess who else gets hair exception to your house I do all of Metallica get a lot of people tell me your wigs
 some things we keep private certain things people wear wigs and you wouldn't believe it
 it's okay I feel about wearing a wig
message message showed up on the Shelf with a wig
 no because people just got comfortable with like being bald I think you know just shaving the head that no one shave their head of Our Generation no man shave their head hard core and we started shaving our heads people you walk to school with the shaved head a little bit by a happened to see if you want to have crazy you look like you have cancer that's what they were saying yeah I think you would just look like a criminal people told me that rug and I
 I'm saying put your head down I can't see the top of your head and what's your all that I think mine is a good shape had some people need hair
Bellissima hair extensions would you ever get that I'm not for against them I mean you wouldn't say anything I want to see it you want to talk behind my back I'm sure I would talk behind your back and I probably look a lot better with it
 Mara says now we did not get to the second part of the question should do that quick or should we just do that next time
 how is Mama fish tonight with her quickness that has my heart bishnu and Avatar of Krishna was just reading that
 remind me to do what you want to do it
 is krishna's eat source of all manifestations
 it's like inside or in but we had in our lineage we have Insider info that even all of Hinduism doesn't get it all out and blind it all you know if you get a chance
if you're not really into like like martial arts than you like but you sort of like it you watch the UFC but the more you get into it you find all these bootleg underground fights that go on in other places if you got to get Insider info like where there's a crazy mixed martial arts going is a crazy thing with a good bare-knuckle just watch what I'm saying in our lineage we have all this Insider info until Lord Krishna
 I think the quiet I think the confusion may be due to one perhaps when we think of Avatar we think of the Lila avatars
 which are Krishna coming in different forms that are performing far out past sounds like you comes as Lord Rama becomes a SodaStream labor when you hear mahavishnu he's like lying asleep you know like in an in an ocean and but those the Pro Shop
cars are 3 expansions for handed Vishnu expansions that are responsible for the manifestation of the material world and the cycles of creation destruction that take place in a 10 Permian on three different levels there's mahavishnu which is like the soul of the entire material realm from his pores of the skin, unlimited universes
 inside each Universe he becomes the garbage out shy Vishnu fills it up half with water and lies on their water from his Naval grows the Lotus and Lord Vermont birth on that then Lord ramadas a secondary creation of the creation of that little tiny universe
 and then from him come all the species of life and then Into the Heart of every of every living being here is 1/3 / shop at are cured of HIV skin or we call refers to all of them but sometimes we we especially when we use the word parmatma we are, they're referring to that guy.
part of every living entity so the Krishna he's engaged in his Lila in it in the spiritual realm he doesn't have to he doesn't he doesn't have to take care of all the business because we want an illusion because we want a virtual reality he says if you want to lose you and I can provide for you and he provides it through this the Porsche avatars they create the virtual reality they maintained and penetrating permeate the virtual reality that we're playing in down through the pro shop at Arthur's Pro Shop at ours theirs Lila avatars when Christian comes to play is gonna avatars which are Vishnu Brahma and Shiva that are that you know that keep the cycles of creation maintenance and destruction moving there's a month buntar avatars the monitors the father's a man kind of 14 in the day of Vermont does the yoga avatars every yoga has an avatar the the teachers it's Dharma
 and then they shut your face avatars which are
Howard living beings living beings that are powered by Krishna like yassa differences so there's all these different types of fishes one variety
 all right
 I can't hear you ugly do you need yourself and thank you thank you baby for you if you look really bored cuz you're not good at it I'm not good to compare me to like the first violinist from Russia forget it or see to The Soloist Wiki Sam
 that would drive people out of your room isn't it like the or
who has a first seat but then like those the solar site visit they just drop in as I got to ask her I'm going to ask her I think she's the first covid-19 to Institute summer camp there will be no swimming or volleyball on this summer camp
 I think it is studying science with the science summer camp
 if maybe you have to believe in UFOs to the whole thing everyone believes in UFOs except the so-called science
 even our government for a while and talk about a bunch of documents the government now what is it Area 51 or whatever it's called

 roswell's real you want to play Roswell game we can play that game
 it's my post yesterday. Angelos in Aliens
 I saw it at I can't pay too much attention to what were you asking I just like the help that they're they're not indifference and I'll get eliminate some of the aliens are like not so
 you're not so good a right to feel complete they would be yes there's demigods there's demons so under the aliens on the grill of alien Gallery it's like saying Hinduism this means they're from somewhere else they're not from here

 it does on the new downloadable e passports
 guess what
 what are Italy trip is almost sold out
 maybe we ought to double letters
no I'm serious like another bus but why we limited to that number should be unlimited to a certain point where you do people want to talk to me they can't talk to me because a lot of people I'm doing it for there until about it is it is it's got to be a breaking point where you lose your intimacy true
 then maybe we should have two of them
