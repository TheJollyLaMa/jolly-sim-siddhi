 it's cuz she was going are you kidding
 okay that is that so we're going to call a people first and we're going to start off with your bag hairy ball for to make Barrel
 now Jimmy Carroll gave a little introduction about herself yesterday and we are on the edge of my seat because Kimmy Carol
 she said quite
 be a career because that light is sort of a very interesting resume
so I've always liked doing and learn a lot of different things so
 a welder and when I learned that I like welding that I wasn't afraid of fire anything I was like oh that's pretty cool I'm not afraid of fire so I started becoming a fire breather and with being a fire breather cuz that a natural progression for welders I'm not sure I'm not sure but with that I joined a sideshow group and then you learn all sorts of different skills like eating fire playing on sword-swallowing and I did that for a little bit but then I injured myself once and that was the end of that that lets all imagine how bad could be an injury. I guess maybe I need to stop doing this so yeah so right before I was going to go and do a big tour with do
all these things and I met my husband and then we got married we had a kid and so I look kind of shifted and now I'm a lot more calm than what I used to be I know I'm here if you missed out in the very interesting part of your career prosthetic okay so before all of that the fire happening I used to make prosthetic Limbs and Orthotics it's kind of like if you can create something with one kind of material is something that you can create with any kind of material you just have it it's just a mechanical abilities just part of your wealth you welded legs no no I was like a steelworker in it in a factory and I metal fabrication Place yeah and then so I got laid off from that job and then I just applied for the ascetic and Orthotics job just on a whim and that my boss you took a chance on me I went and met him and he's like okay so can you make this so it was like a pair of orthotics so I cut all of it
Orthotics it's for your feet for your shoes if you have like a foot problem yeah but you get their special custom to your feet make a cast to your foot is going to be fed here most people do so he just saw that I could make things and he's like okay and then I work there for about a year and then I got laid off from there then I came back to New York City and that's when the whole site shows that begin schocolat Alex perhaps that was later set on fire we could do that we could we could do that it's just you you make the mold is just all of old and create an over top of the bowl and then we melt it and then it's like if you dip things in it and her husband which I found out later was an old friend of mine he was in the be played drums and Shay
how are you today when he was 16 years old when I first moved to New York City and unbelievable and then I lived with him when he was 19 and amazing amazing story small world
 and how did you get inspired to get back to you but something like always searching for something but not quite sure what I didn't grow up in a religious household because my dad's family is Irish Catholic my mom's family was Irish Protestants so there was the constant we just didn't really talk about it that was fast in the house so it wasn't really that wasn't really something that was brought up so I just I didn't really believe in you I believe in something but I wasn't really sure what and then it was just sometimes you know being around and then you would see like hardcore
dancing and singing and I remember thinking why they have so much joy I want with that is like that it's just you would feel it when you're around the presents and then I was just like something that I would see every now and again I didn't really think about and then all the times I'd be in Union Square and I see everybody there and I'd like to talk to the devotees as much as I could and it was always such a wonderful experience so a devotee gave me a bunch of Akita and then I was like okay so I had a hard time reading it cuz it's kind of hard to follow so I went online and found the child versions of it, but I didn't know that I would love some, so I just found it a lot easier to understand and then even listening to wisdom of the stages that break everything down it just makes it more understandable then
 then just picking up Andre is kind of like if you try to read the Bible it's hard to read but what's a hard book to read that Old Testament but then if you hear the children's store
interesting and captivating in your mind can understand it better so I will always think of it like it was actually looked up is there a Christian book for dummies like there's always something for dummies there isn't one though there should be there is me and bunky and Mary are going to dramatize it later on this afternoon or the other night to that we're going to do that so I can we Carol what's your question for today so everyone has dated a life with a constant struggles with other people and the flight annoyances here are there how can you can't get passes how do you just not become so triggered with the way that other people are the actions and reactions like if you're driving and then someone cut you off does it say not like how you just like Let It Go or like rude people had you just let that go like I I find them in a constant struggle to not take a personal and
not get angry so I just think okay they have their own path or doing whatever is not about me and I can think about that in my head but the way I feel it is completely different so what do you do how do you do you still have these struggles that's a great question
 play so free till I tell go and to just
 let it lie just let everything go and not for the expression when you're in the city Lee you know you see it all the time on the subway on the train is people walking on my god get in my voice low Walker I'm trying to get somewhere and it's just think about it like it's not the end of the world but I can't always get past it is just like a constant struggle that is in my mind and when I go to sleep and I just kind of private please give me a call or just let me have more tolerance towards other people that is that is a very great question I think jump jump on this campaign first.
all the good news is you noticing it most people just think that's life like someone will walk in the room like who is this jerk like they'll just say that they'll just say who is that jerk or that might be wearing something that they would never wear what the hell they think there are walking in with that outfit on people actually think like that and they speak like that
 so when you start to become conscious of it you start to realize this guy who is triggering me because the outfit he's wearing or the way he's behaving or do you just talk into loud these triggers are my problems
 even if you sang something actually a defensive if I'm triggered by it that's a sign that it's pushing me to sort towards something that I have to check in with myself if there is anger
 angry that's
Beatles brightness and lost everybody we are back so I don't know where you left off but basically the same triggers our signals for me to check in with myself if I'm angry that anger is within me people can trigger me to get angry it's my anger though and that's what I have to deal with I'm not I'm responsible
for my anger and I'm responsible for my reactions so part of it is to note note that and just to hear that and just to hear that and when I start going there I started this is me this is me I'm going to stop blaming and I'm going to stop complaining these two things will not allow me to chant Hare Krishna with pure heart if you want to chant Hare Krishna with a pure heart blame you can be sitting in Rockland right or you can be in a kirtan or going to you know you can have all these spiritual accoutrements
 but if you can't stop blaming and complaining you have a very low ceiling for your spiritual evolution
 and this is big and will happen is and in your case it is happening is you're sincere so you probably been chanting you probably reading and then Christian I want you to have this mirror in front of your face
and the mirror shows us all of our shortcomings and it it's it we get angry at seeing our own shortcomings and I think we've waited a spiritual now I should be more involved in this but that's part of cleaning the house ever move your couch once you move your cat you realize oh my God my house is really dirty I was doing pretty good until I move that couch and still in the process of cleaning the house the house if someone walks in while you're cleaning there be like your house is a mess what's going on here like one cleaning it in the process of cleaning and it gets dirtier so if you feel like you're going through some pain you're noticing all these shortcomings you'll why aren't I more spiritual I'm doing all the right things that's because you're sincere and Christmas calling you forward and he's holding them are up at mirror up in front of your face and it's when we start to notice these things about us
 is when we start to correct them and maybe we should we get shown out there is a fork this real
action is me I can't do this any longer if you want to add to that Prabhu
 is a lot so much we could say it's a really good question I think it's a question that you know people into import people come to spirituality as one of the first things we really going to start to wrestle with
 you know what
 once that may be the place to start is the idea that why do we why are we concerned with this like why why do I want to become free from these feelings that I have inside some yogis there their thing is they want to feel peace
 and so why am I burdened with these thoughts and these feelings I want to feel peace the Krishna devotees of it's a little bit that's there but their real motive it is not exactly that the real motive these thoughts and these feelings are preventing me there in the way of me feeling love for Krishna right in other words they're occupying my mind and not allowing my
to contemplate
 my relationship with God and feel those feelings I'm an absorbing these feelings instead of the feelings that I really want to be absorbed in with your feelings and emotion so if we approach it with that from that perspective we're not thinking like why don't I have peace now we're thinking I'm on a lifelong mission to get to the point where I'm feeling those feelings and thinking those thoughts all the time where it where my mind is Absorbine fuckton Krishna Consciousness and you and I'm feeling love for God and when I feel that I'm going to feel up for all the people that are connected. Including the one who's better her than disturbing my mind all alone and so so then if we approach it from that perspective then we're already not thinking why not today why not tomorrow you know that we're thinking like okay this is going to take some time I want to come to this level of Consciousness now I need to work on it and then what so it's so now it's not like oh you're disturbing my peace it's like oh here's
the next challenge for me in my process of coming to full Krishna Consciousness and wood rug and I said was about about complaining or blaming you when when the in the moment when you're feeling those feelings then you have the choice right there on one side of the coin is complain or blame
 but now we're training are mine because we've heard and so now we say not complain or blame but reflect that we reflect on what we've heard because looking at this from like the pure kind of Yannick respected appear like philosophical perspective
 really what you're saying is when I'm disturbed by these people it's I suffer is a state of suffering and course none of us like to suffer so how do we relieve our suffering
and the Taughannock point of view the philosophical point of view is that ignorance is the cause of our suffering is only that we have false programming in the mind that we suffer if we felt our true nature and understood our true nature and understood our true situation we wouldn't be suffering and so then what is the if ignorance is the cause of suffering than what gives relief to suffer his knowledge and so then in that moment rather than complain or blame in a state of ignorance we reflect on the knowledge and that knowledge it comes in many like there many
 facets of the knowledge of any statements that one could reflect on you know statements of knowledge I want to reflect on like blame means this this in considered unfair person has caused my suffering now and what we were flagged on for a since you reflect on the edge of karma right that if it's come my way then my face and what I've heard from
is that have been handed down for so many thousands years by so many great sages who did achieve this higher state of consciousness is that whatever kind of sufferings, my way in life that I caused them at some point and now it's coming back at me or my Reformation so if I if I switch to blame I just keep the cycle going but if I switch to reflect that I reflect on that knowledge
 even though it feels like this person coming at me is coming out of nowhere with this stuff and I don't deserve it let me think that let me reflect and think about it in another way that what's coming at me right now is something that I've sent it other people whether in this life in a previous life it's the same kind of energy that they're playing with I've been playing with
 and I'm either going to stay in that cycle or I'm going to try and send it through this reflection saying okay it's come back at me I'm not I'm not and I'm not going to hold any animosity towards the person that's sending it my way
that's that that's just like okay that's the Sprout of true things in the relief of your son bring in the truck so you don't get in that so that's the day ideas that the more you reflect it's one thing to hear the knowledge that's really important but then when you reflect on it in that moment
 and it really starts to take Route it's it's LED becomes less theoretical and in the more you do that the more the mind is reprogram to see the world that way now you're so at a certain point it becomes less of a challenge becomes easier and easier when we meet people that seem like they're spiritually Advanced is because they've been practicing this kind of thing and it's and it's helping them to see like this all the time
 but with body yoga there's still another element to that and that's Christmas Mercy brightest like
 I wish I was as powerful yogic person with this you know ability to always reflect
and in blue release all these things and let go of all these things but it's really hard
 a Christian of the reason I want to let go them because I want to love you and these things are interfering with my love for you you know you please
 help me come to the point where my mind can always be absorbed in you and that kind of prayers the kind of pray that it takes you is taking shelter of Krishna rather than trying to overcome the material energy by your own power
 and that's like a whole nother Dynamic we're Christmas can get personally involved in your life and get person involved in your mind and and and
 give me the status on a shelter with you
right back in the right by saying you know even if someone's coming at that Yogi even with intentional hostility there's no animosity towards the person because they're seeing not only not only the Gannett point do you like okay they're operating through a program mines with the most material nature so they're pure Consciousness operating through that is coming on this walk away at me
 what they're thinking still actually that person is dear to Krishna Underneath It All underneath all the war for mine that person
so if they're not dear to me I'm out of alignment with Krishna who's the the the being that I'm trying to be through love being in alignment with and so that that it's so it's both for the body of his foes were practicing were reflecting on the knowledge that we've heard in the moment we're also praying to Krishna Krishna I want to be yours entirely I want my mind to be yours I want my body and all this other stuff is getting in my mind it's in the way please help me become free of this and then Krishna Krishna can dynamically get involved in may take a lifetime you know to to really get there but that's how about that but that's alright that's our mission you know and it's a great mission to keep you engaged to keep seeing you know it keeps you but I hope this works and it might take very quick to and make them really quick this stuff really really works
we have full faith in you, Carol set some of the devotees they said they've done this thing where like they put a you know those rubber wristbands that people wear some bracelets so they put one on one wrist and then I say like anytime I'm going to complain or Blaine
 and I put on the other list to get through today without moving it once all right and then in the account bility keeps she keeps you
 okay then like that you know it's just a little way of trying to train the mind
 Lindsey Scott come on down Lindsey Scott original
listeners he came to India matter in taxes in 2019 and she just came on pilgrimage and then describe pilgrimage for you because you don't really know that much about anyting I did not know anyting all I knew was you said some things that a yoga Workshop that ring rang true to me and fell I just made me feel something that I needed to hear and what did you say I didn't move in ready and just not criticizing and all these things that I struggled with spirituality into deeper level and I felt like it was I've been going to yoga Austin I've been doing the yoga teacher training but I felt like it brought something that
 it was like this is what this is where we're going here like
it always working for me but it was just I needed the endgame brought that thank you for you both of you and all of you I'm so honored to be in your presence it's it means a lot and it was 2019 when we got back and me and Maura started doing the Super Soul sacred Tsonga and we went through the bog of a time and then and then Martin and a few of you guys were jumping in on that was a Zumba for anyone in a head stocking zoom zoom was that we had a class of yoga students some hardcore people from around they cast you will jump in and then after a while we like let's make this into a podcast and that started 20-20-20 Infamous 2020 when everybody is looking for something to watch I'm so you were there the entire time
 great
 and welcome aboard how is your spiritual life you're out there in San Antonio now
it's it's it's there and it's good and I'm so thankful for it it's challenging right now have a three-year-old and a one-year-old and so finding the time and energy and strength two more into it when you don't have very much of a bear to spare I stay home with them and so just remember that the time that you spend with them is also part well thank that God is good to hear I had something else to do but yeah so what's your question doesn't have to do with the other one of the three-year-old hahaha like where are they now I my question is for advice and for I feel so new and like an infant myself in my body practice
like I'm
 have so many things that I need to work on and yet how I can share and bring this to my kids so that they don't have to you know go through all the stumbling blocks and reprogramming I and I and my husband has a really good his own practice not into bhakti but he's extremely supportive and he's he's very he's more into Catholicism and I used to be and then I've kind of shifted so how were kind of integrating both of these Faith both of these practices and face into our family and how to do that in a way that is beautiful and harmonious and it doesn't have to be at odds it's just what works for one another and and again I'd suggest
how to share bhakti with my children and when I don't feel qualified and be how to counteract the the program living in the material world and how to counteract the programming that happens that I like I see it happening and my kids and it's it's challenging to
 how do you how do you counteract that cuz I didn't program by the world are this little cuz they're only three in one so it's like I can't have these deep conversations with them yet like yes is a really really cool truck but like let's not bass Amazin doctor R Us mother never did that
I don't think you're overthinking I think you're thinking you're not overthinking you're thinking and how to raise children in in a in a world that is like it's a ripped truck tide dragging them to overwhelm and Maya materialism that's what we should be thinking when we're parents and let them know I'm happy you're thinking about it and I'll go first with this one but you know we my kids were little bit of conscious idea of how we wanted to raise them and you know we had alternative schooling certain points we homeschool that certain points we put them in Waldorf schools where there was a lot of pressure not to have any screens or even television for the kids and because of it it it protects them because we are what we see
 and you don't even got to a point where I was living in New York City at a career in New York City as the other teacher it was a thriving career and it just wasn't good for the kids I had to put my kids over the career
and we moved to the countryside and we end in New York City can't let your kids just can't do that so I compromised and I got a television I said okay you can watch whatever they were watching back then I can't remember what I was and yeah it wasn't Sesame Street just Turtles something it was something where yeah
 I I felt very very compromised so I remember the day that
 we just going to go upstate and I traded in the television for a creek and a and when you have an encouraging environment of other like-minded parents that are also working also opting for this none of that stuff for the kid I'm not going to let them lean into that it affects the child's mind
 that being said I was from a copper my parents raised me on television I can name you every commercial from 1974 to 78
what is been I've been raised by television is my babysitter and I thought it was a good thing back then so it's not like we're hopeless but
 it is overwhelming what's out there in the material world right now for kids and and what's even in the regular schools so I do think it's good to be really thoughtful about and get on the same page with your husband about it how you want to raise it and do it very intentional raising of kids in our kids don't need the screen still there older anyway it's also sometimes be given to me just too late to deal with them you know but sometimes we have to like figure out how we want to raise them and I'm not going to say there's some gold standard for it but it's dump someone something that you can look into it I think it's good that you are another thing is when it's there whenever there's mix space in a family I think it's useful to extract the values of the faiths so forgiveness of faith
Christian music forgiveness of bhakti there's a lot of things we have in common with spiritual traditions and if you extract the values and teach the kids the values the in values of a you know you know you put in your time and you work for something and then you get a result as an important value the value of you know being a pathetic and listening to some person's problems before you just start to share all your problems first first hearing a person before you start sharing and then then first let them be first understand them before you ask to be understood you know you know what honesty and integrity these are all important things that you can share with the kids and if you wanted to get him or specific things Mike it like with my kids they grew up reading around me on in the Mahabharat and you could always wear black with those because
 even in a very broad sense even even books I do consider sort of myth
you know maybe there's Nordic metzer things like that generally these ancient Tales tell stories of archetypes so even if you're reading it in a Monday and where the back of that I left about the what about the time but the Mahabharat they have these archetypes of Good and Evil the archetypes of Envy the archetypes of lost the archetypes of chivalry the archetypes of car it is good for a child to understand that these are different things that I can choose I can choose to be courageous now I can choose not to let you see what happens when you act in it and this is what happens if you end up like durian you suffer where you end up like Robin you suffer I think it's really important to have those the same time they're learning these stories with your almost like cartoons
 but these are the same cartoons that will start to Blossom as a the Romney on starts to Blossom when the child's 14 and they're in their 17th over their newly married what does
you know in our age now in our fifties we love to read the wrong me on it means something completely different to us and then also when were old men and old ladies that Romney imel take out a new meaning the Mahabharat the bhagavad-gita these books that you read you put on your shelf check that off my bucket list what else am I going to do for summer reading these are books you read for your entire life and it will affect them and you can teach them purses that little nuts just like my mother used to give me little chunks of information that you would say every don't take drugs or she's a million of them and they were impregnated into my brains from childhood and some of them are crazy and some of them were very useful
 and some of them if they're still in my brain and
 if you read my book I don't want to read my book but if you read my book there's one there's one point or
there is a time where I'm drowning in Brazil and while I was drowning ice my I remember my mother saying never swim in waters you're unfamiliar with and I was like she was right I was unfamiliar with this water and now I'm drowning why didn't I listen so we can teach these nuggets of wisdom to children and the bhagavad-gita spilled and you can even if you find a very complicated like like he was saying all this so complicated as you can relate to and or maybe even write it in a similar fashion and and have the child learn those and for kids they learned vs. and shlokas in Sanskrit and English sometimes just for fun because everything to a kid is a game you know we play sloka games with the kids when they were little and but you can only give as much as the you can only give as much as you got so the real thing is
create a bubble around yourself for your own education make some time for that and not just education before your own spiritual life a little bit of time in the morning and it's hard being a mom and a little bit of time in the evening but you know if you ever been to a temple or been to India and you see people chanting sitting around and going through all the different rituals in the morning rituals in the evening devotional service may look different from mother of a one-year-old and a three-year-old there it may look different but you can always have kirtan going in the house you can cook with love and devotion and offer your food and feed them prashad it's quite powerful
 thank you for being so sincere this if you want to act obviously knows so much more about this than I do cuz I've never had kids and and I've seen what he's you know how he is kind of all the experiences that he's giving his kids and how
 how it's how it's affected their lives and it's actually not having kids all so kind
give me a bit of like an observer, detached Observer kind of view perspective like it's blowing it is so many different types of parents and how they operate in in that can absorb the kids and see where they're at so I've got that going for me and Josh are just maybe just a little bit
 you know but one thing I have done is actually at our kids like about by that groups of school kids and stuff and I really enjoyed that and it makes me think of that could find a parent but I do you know and I think I would want to give them knowledge
 and especially the most important knowledge is like this this fundamental knowledge you like what is this all because you are a soul and the tree has a soul and the dog has a soul and and in all the other people their souls and they're moving to the bodies you don't like just it it just a very simple love
to give that framework right from the beginning I think could be really life-changing thing and can be done in a very simple way cuz it makes so much sense right it just to is the kid gets up in the beginning then so now all of the values that you wants to buy them to embrace as they're growing up they're all within the context of that very fundamental idea
 and I think that they do take Route much more easily in that kind of clear logic of the Soul you know so that's one thing I think and another thing is that that being said it's I think we're going to set about like when your kids everything's a game is really important because you want to invest knowledge you want to invest values into them
 but it seems like as soon as it stops being fun
 then it's almost counterproductive like
child extra time sure said but I don't want to speak in absolutes hear something like that but another what's the more fun that it is the more that they're going to delete the less that they're going to resist it the more that they're going to voluntarily embrace it but they're there can be
 did the dynamic were you trying to force it
 and that might be counterproductive said that then now they're going to build up walls of resistance against it so
 I would imagine it's it's it's probably a difficult thing for a parent but like a really important thing to know when just to let go and spend it be patients you know that's going to do not force it now but the time will come when you know where the word were I'll have another opportunity to to share this and maybe have to adjust it must be like a really hard riddle being that you have such a strong
she needs to make up that have such a strong you to write down to the core your heart you're so invested in their welfare and then but they've got their own mind and ideas and then you just got to wash them do this end and we want to help but sometimes you're trying to help and it's not helping and it's got to be a real real gut-wrenching kind of thing would know better than me but you are starting to learn to Humble let them work through things as a mother you just want to you just want to make everything okay and you want to make everything and then you realize they're not learning new I keep if I keep doing that. So another thing I saw on Brokenness life is kind of a big Dynamic move
 is like you bring these kids to India and you give them experience that no other kids in there
do you know have and you do it in a way that it's really fun and really interesting and you're just kind of it to me that seems like it's a big Dynamic shift in the child's life where they got something that the other kids around them don't have not that it not that it kind of divides them from them but it does kind of seems to me like it's very significant is very you know you showed them a whole nother world you know that that can that can be a real game-changer and you kind of experience at in your own lives
 thank you thank you
 what they did change my kids so I just going into India on a regular basis and it's just set up a new normal worshipping the because I'm living up here there's not
Countryside it's not like there's a normal Temple we go to and stuff like that so India became sort of The New Normal and it's sort of changes them and it sinks in with them at different phases of their life will just become normal bathing in the ganga becomes normal going to holy places meeting sodders became normal
 do you know her husband went there the first you know for six years of his life every year he went and the other kids have been there like nine times each to I never remember when we had a great day once together and burn dominated many great days very early with a beautiful group of people we left for molarity at the Rotterdam on Temple and we just kept going the whole day until late at night we're back down in the temples it was you know probably do not like 9:38 or some of that and we're in in Baki bihari Teri how are you which is like I don't know
I think of
 you know Subway that's pack think of Subway on the warpath and and and and if you know what a bum B train is like incredibly crowded incredibly wild you know Temple and they're opening the curtains and closing the curtains and throwing colors around and just like in your cap like husband to be like this is business as usual here and said she was probably $17 a loving and that she was right in the middle of it all and somehow I was given their sponsors as I keep an eye on her. That's like I'm driving and it's cheese in them is all men she's jamming the little girl in the middle like just getting to get up and walk around it and I'm like okay are you okay
I got a bit of a distance in the car you are right you know where you ready to go now he's kind of town cuz I want to stay until like they throw all the color and I said oh this is definitely the daughter of re of today what was keeping her there was just her pure devotional enthusiasm it wasn't wasn't someone saying you know you should do this she had it in her and then point and she was excited and it it just all bhakti is very kid-friendly can bring them to some festivals and some temples and Dallas or Houston and it's very attractive singing dancing eating if you can find the temple like Dallas or Houston to celebrate the holidays well and you take them for the special
 you know very different experiences at Lely doused a very beautiful beautiful paintings in Vermont
it's good to have the bright light here how about how are you
 so happy to be here is the same as you always look at the light emanating from her and I was driving down this morning cuz I'm here for the day and I was thinking about four years ago when you have that one day Retreat here during covid it was like right after, and now I arrived here and it was like a spiritual family reunions homecoming and just like so happy to see all of these amazing. Saul's & Friends and send it to you it's like I just asked for any losses hit the deck
route me back to India and I'm so happy to be here and just so grateful to both of you for how you've changed and transformed my life and we're grateful to you and that's a sign of a people spiritual evolution is they start to appreciate I appreciate what they have and they have things have been given to us by other people so I can tell you're doing very good cuz the first things out of your mouth or appreciations a great teacher
 and it's really cool to see some that Justine is a brand-new to bother you and she said she told me she might come on my life thank you for your incredible service by the way sometimes brand new doesn't work out Lindsey Scott was a good story Jessie and I've got to pay them trust you but sometimes I feel like I'm leaving I'm leaving tonight so if you need
cuz it's the way out escape hatch yeah so should I ask my question actually relates to some of the questions are asked about the first line about tolerance how to be tolerant when someone is triggering you and also what was the the I forgot there's something else how do you deal with how do you deal with family members if they think they're suspicious excetera how do you in a way without getting defensive respond to someone who is questioning in the past your past or even insinuating heart rate out saying that it seems like you're in a call and how do how did how to meet that in a way that perhaps they can hear and not just think that you're even deeper in the Colts you know
it's exactly what they called never would say you're in the cult and they've already dug in her heels they don't want to discussion they don't want you to answer them they've already made up their mind and so there is nothing to say really oh and it's coming from La it's like they love you and they they're missing this old way in which you were used to party together sibling and drink beer together why do you do that you're no fun anymore. Like that was like this part of the city you know and and and I'm just unless like I'm still I have my personality absolutely right but I remember talking to Steve in India when you have like how do you remain more like equanimeous like there's more Equanimity and you're not quite as well and you're not quite as you know and just sort of your a little more Baseline and people can think you're brainwashed
you know like you no longer have you know these out emotions and so it's I believe it's a misconception and I feel very grounded and rooted in my face and in my our community and our community in Vermont and all these things but they're how would you how would you simply you know kind of how we just still liked each body the kids or someone who's new teach the essence of bacta to someone who is threatened by your your lifestyle teach the essence of it to them or help them understand what you wish for the first you the second is that I know from the get-go there was people that weren't especially people that I'm close to they were just not going to get it they're just not going to get it they like me a certain way they don't like any change I mean I used to feel like this all the time like on Facebook there like
 the pictures
posting on Facebook from high school like this was like they're still living and trying to hold on to a Bobby a haircut at things we did all that happened that like as if nothing time hasn't changed as a matter fact I'll even set you changed as if that's a bad thing I was thinking I saw some little cartoon where it says like someone's looking for one person you've changed it may even been like a butterfly or something like that right now there is some concern and if they do want the want to have conversation
 if you have imbibed the reasons why we are changing like sometimes I would tell me if I mention this in the book or not but my mom came downstairs when I got back from India it at 4 in the morning with my robes on just chanting loud
day or something or some like that and she's like what are you doing
 and you could understand it like it's completely Farhan from the little catholic kid I raised and now he's got some weird robe on and back in the 80s that even internet you didn't even know what a robe was your seem super call T and so I just said I just had to deescalate it I just said I'm praying I'm praying it's just a way to pry it up to sometimes you have to be a really crazy Christian priest and I asked my aunt and I just said I am a Christian priest you swap out there is one God
there's one God Valentina in this exactly what you love God with your heart - all they just do it different in different cultures they just do it different in different cultures I was in the culture of India in a touch her to move her to one of these things that your mom and in certain Mom especially my family they are like these matriarch ladies a bit they're like way older than you they have all these other kids before you ending up for the little kid of the family to sort of change the Mom it's not so easy sometime sometimes people have moms and their moms are like Diablo let me be a Harry Krishna really depends on who you deal with I mean I had a whole hardcore punk Community there like he's lost his mind he's lost it and you have to actually explain it in such a way that they can understand they put rubbing off on the cover the biggest hardcore magazine of the time making him seem like a total called well they did
me and then and it was the guy who ran the magazine was like we were very good friends is so it was like a people but try out it was a tip to try out because it's one thing it was the interview but because he was the editor of the magazine he would just insert things like this exactly what he'll never said no one he said that and it was so it cover the magazine didn't seem like it was kind of weird like I was just feel like I was drinking or something and so it's especially hurtful went here here's the interesting thing what are we asking what's the asking bhakti stop being fake start being genuine let go of your ego stop performing bad habits at the whole world is doing in the is recommend let's all get drunk let's party let's get rid of it being a little bit more grounded treat people with dignity Sea Spirit and every living being
checked all religious pass I mean and and it's a it's a big ass it's like I'm going to go away from the from the herd and become that special person now in India if you have a kid that does that it's like it's like wow they're going to go become a monk or something we were I was wrong but you're not even a month but I was going to become a monk and sore like it's hard he's going to leave the family but he's doing it for great oval soon it's a noble thing in America it's like you're the worst you're doing the worst
 I have a new name because your ego be burying of a monk of someone who was a monk has really really you could have been if he could have been something professional skier competitive so you have to find out who your audiences and you have to deal with them some people
I got to find if there are people who will have conversations you have a very genuine heart to heart conversation but some people like you and can only know you in that low Vibe like if you if you partied with them you know what I mean and they end because by you saying you know what I don't party anymore it's threatening to their partying I have so many old friends or sometimes even family members that I'll go back for you in a Christmas or Thanksgiving or so with that and we'll be like
 I don't say anything about vegetarianism begin his don't say anything about it they bring it up I'm not pushing on them they're like because they're they feel confronted just because I'm saying no so expect expect that when you want to jump high right there's going to be people are just about that I want to jump I you know that if you want to work out and do yoga or start jogging there's going to be people are just like
God they're going to resent you for being the best you you know that's my just from the other perspective
 we can be a little bit conscious of the cultish kind of things in this movement where it wasn't a cult but it did have a lot of the particular right in the beginning you did have a lot of cultish Dynamics operating within it to you little call Dynamics so you know what the easiest way to kind of diffuse data to meet them yeah you know how like the Christian concert movie has had some coffee Dynamics but the most part it's over it and where there are no it's a big world wide thing with all kind of different people in and I got to find my my way
not like you're either in or you're out you know I don't do this then your yeah and then and then once a Super Soul compound in Upstate New York, I can't wait to meet you guys because they have no doubt these guys
 Adidas sweatpants to my wedding please it'll be good for the family but it if it's for me but also for like students and other people who are in families are married that their partners are like what are you getting into it here that's also been you know
a different kind of like they're certain people on a certain level witch like you know those aren't call Dynamics those are the Dynamics of any serious spiritual practitioner and a good professor Larry Shin here can I tell you about that you're not like most people aren't so much on that level most people are more like on this emotional level so that's when it's just like him I'm alright and you know just being able to admit that there have been some called Dynamics but that's not what you're into already that just kind of put you told me on the other side of the cult Dynamic and and in a kind of loosens them up and then some people's requires patience some people are not saying you're trying to go up in there trying to pull you down some of those people are just going to fall by the wayside and defensiveness
 it is as likely unless it's done very cool-headed and very kind of like a detached away defensiveness kind of like reinforces their idea
you got to just walk it a little carefully thank you so much and thank you for being such beacons of light thank you and that's our show for today tomorrow more q and a banker to joining us live life as it was with sages weekend here at Super Soul Farm it's so fun to have everybody here I'm looking forward to it I am slightly intimidated and overwhelmed and I when I woke up this morning I was like there's 50 people at our home ready for joining us on Zoom that was sitting right next to cuz to buy so I couldn't even read the message for today
