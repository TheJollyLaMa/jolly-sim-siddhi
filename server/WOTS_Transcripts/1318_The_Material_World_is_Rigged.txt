burn pile and I burnt it last night has been burning all night long and that's exciting buyer's expense yeah you need to ever sit in the fireplace just look at the fire people say nothing they just look at it and then that same type of heat energy has been transferred to like Netflix Netflix but there's something pure pure pure by just staring at fire and coming no one's come after watching Netflix
 but look at me look how grounded I are off to Brimfield it's a big man it's a saying it's a favor in the field of Upstate are the chief and Lori they probably know about Brimfield it's a big it's a massive the whole town becomes like a flea market

 Mara Mara good morning does it come on the showing what we have
call Tiff Kane Josh cane sauce in a class for Patron numbers today at 10:30 a.m. foxy recovery group meetings at 12:30 and 1 and coming up on Sunday is the urban Davie Sangha
 finding strength in difficult relationships bad it's all about bad relationships is the way to go now you're to do you want to talk to two experts on it you come to this podcast to comfortable I need some paint and some more pain
 there's nothing more nothing more like to have a growth spurt when you're going through hell and you Lena to Krishna and you lean into the philosophy isn't it
what's a catapult for a spiritual life
 let's hear about the Nugget today Runners who who's this from a children's rhyme nugget you know who wrote it I think the Grimm Brothers know
 Liberace I don't know who writes besides the Grimm Brothers who writes neural lives
 Burl Ives did he write The Star-Spangled Banner by Francis Scott Key bridge to Scott K okay if the old lady that swallowed the fly yeah okay there was an old lady who swallowed a fly a drive but you're an agreed
I don't know why she swallowed the fly perhaps she'll die there was an old lady who swallowed a spider that wrinkled and jiggled and tickled inside her face to do this to my kids she swallowed the spider to cast a fly the flag part yeah I can take a look I don't know why she swallowed the fly perhaps she'll die bird swallow the Ring of the jiggle to tickle Insider she swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly perhaps she'll die there was an old lady who swallowed a cat welfare and see that she swallowed the swallowed the cat to catch the vs12 the verdict at the spider the real to jiggling tickle Insider she swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly
 now she's going to die because I'm not going to read all the other end
she went on to swallow a dog
 it's just y'all get her yes and then from the dog to catch the dog a goat she's Heart of Gold
 and then to take care of the gold she swallowed a cow
 I don't go on a Hindu Hindu will not let me go there and then to swallow to take care of the cow she swallowed a whole swallowed a American
 no horse has cows he forces what kind of nonsense is this point is that we start off thinking well I'm going to solve this little problem with this little solution we we create a material solution for a material problem but it often complicates us more we become more implicated and I think the idea of this is simple
and another part which will get it today is there's no material solution to our material pain there a spiritual solution to our material pain it's because we're spiritual people
 that we need a spiritual solution to our problems would try to fix things and it's almost like putting my finger in a damn and put it in my other finger in a damn what am I left the damn I can't even put my right to the damn it's like whack-a-mole with material issues but there is a material solution and it focuses on working on my cell
 and not try to control the things I can control
 yeah I mean I think when we say working on our self like you knows of the bog of X version of that would be buying gauging and devotional service right through the path of bhakti what does it mean like a self massager
change to my own habits yeah I start changing my own lifestyle that's not in line
 with the laws of the universe OK Google I think you just hit I think you hit the nail on the head right to edit in one sense this story or similar stories they speak to this idea that and what we're reading involved with him today we're perladas going to go is that in a sense the world that we're living in his route you know like it may not be the best word but cuz I don't like the word rigged rigged kind of implies like some of broad you know but it's intentionally manipulated you know to work in a particular way for a particular purpose
 and the idea is that like a wise person to kind of read the patterns and you do recognize some truths that are operating through these patterns and come to terms with those truths in the end and as you're saying leaving
army with those truestrike and if we fail to do so
 if we kind of blindly pursue materialism and every time we you know the ideas we if we pursue materialism is going to send problems and if we try to solve those problems by continuing with Flyleaf pursuing materialism by trying to fix it through materialism then it'll tis almost becomes a comical cycle of suffering you know this is this is kind of a condom so much, he's built on it I was thinking of that
 you take
 so much, he's been the fool the oath you know that right
 and they're increasing frustration
 which circumstances because they haven't understood what's really behind it like you take that on that classic Abbott and Costello Who's on First thing right yeah so you have favorites
so you know you have for those that are unfamiliar you got to Google that one Avenue Costello who's on who's on first you will have hours of entertainment and your kids. You may have to know a little bit about baseball for foreigners you don't even have to do so but the ideas you know he's saying who's who's playing first base and who's on First and and the ideas that the person's name of her spaces who so Abbott responds by saying yeah that's right yes you know what's the name of the guy on first What's On Second what's the name of the guy who's trying to get to the problem the same way over and over and over and it just gets more and more complicated rather than saying we need to slow down and examine the whole approach here
 and in so Life Is Life
that you know this woman swallowed the fly she says well while I got to take care of that let me swallow it what was it took care of the spider there's a I have a friend who bought a boat a boat guy but he bought a boat cuz he feels like an elbow it's going to have some fun what does he actually wanted to have some fun for both seem like fun and I'm not putting down there like there are people who are both people and they live on a lake and they they ride him a sale and it's what they do with the regular this has nothing to do with them as people you know what they want so they got some extra money you want to get a boat and once you get a boat you got to get a dock you know I slept that it cost money to get a trailer trailer cuz you got to take it out especially in the winter if you live up here and if there's a storm to the special boat insurance
finish maintenance of a boat right then there's you know all these need a license to the boat were too big but you got to get a captain for the boat it's a thing to have a boat and he told me in a year went by and said hey how's your boat dealer and you know that's so cool you bought a boat and I was sort of thinking like that so cool man and he said you know there's two great there's two great days when the guy buys a boat the day he buys it and I and I don't want to add that I was like wow this is like the swallows fly story because it's like there's an idea of how to make my life more joyous and more beautiful and more simpler and more pleasurable but it's actually no no it's not it's more complicated than we complicated our lives in the name of let's enjoy sense
location and often times it's in the mode of passion ignorance so will not even get a boat will get like a speedboat which was like makes life even more precarious or
 you know do something it'll people right now it's just like okay this is for baseball is boring I want to get into you know riding a bike is boring I'm just going off cliffs doing like it's just like let's make it more and more extreme because the motive goodness is too boring for me I'm with you I think all of the name of the great spiritual tradition wisdom Traditions there's kind of a recognition of this principle that if we're not careful the solutions to our problems create greater problems and let you know taoism from from what little I know about it yes
can we bring it on yeah I think it's like a lot of taoism is based on this principle that you know when we try to fix the universe through our actions it makes things worse and then I pulled this up this is from the Encyclopedia of Applied ethics in and see what they have in there on the taoism my favorite encyclopedia I don't that's why I wonder how is sod happiness or Supreme good by serving themselves by severing themselves completely free from all worldly interest and passionate desires until release from all activity was attained the important I was principles are in action
 Simplicity and living in harmony with nature how is philosophical principle that the towers philosophical principle rested on a belief
in the law of unity of the two opposites two opposite forces yin and yang if one tried too hard to attain a certain want
 the law of reverted effort would start to operate and as a result the effect would be the exact opposite of that desired interesting right and oily and you know we see like
 let's let's take this out of like the realm you were speaking of the realm of like my seeking pleasure through different things are different actions but let's even take it into the broader kind of like a broader social realm of like the economy like healthcare you know I took this from from an article from the correspondent
 I think there's a great Paradox of our time the actually the title of the article is the great Paradox of our time everything
is both better and worse than ever before
 and it speaks it has it says there's a contradiction that presents us with a seemingly unresolvable conundrum the source of our progress has become the source of our downfall
 things are too good for us to change to change it all you too bad for us to leave anything as it is a great Paradox of them of them out of time where were wealthier healthier safer better informed and more prosperous than ever before it gave all kind of Statistics you know how entirely trustworthy they all are but it was painting a picture that you know if you go back a few centuries you know the average let you know 50% of children die before Age 5 or something like that and you know it was like 3% or something and it spoke of the Welton and so where does all this wealth come from in and you know how are things to be transported in you know so it says so although we're wealthy
healthier and safer better informed and all this paradoxically while all the above is undeniably true it's equally true that our world is worse off than ever before humankind is facing problems on a scale unlike anything we've ever seen before and it describes that all of this progress was based on burning millions of years worth of stored energy in the form of oil and gas and coal and releasing trillions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere and the result of that is creating all kind of problems in natural disasters and health problems and excetera excetera excetera problems
 or medicine the ideas that you know week we created all of these
 different chores
 but the Cure is create aziz's in themselves or they create weaknesses that make us vulnerable to diseases like those ads
some medication for depression and then a couple holding hands in the woods and then it will list thousand really fast thousand don't use this medication if you are you know it may cause depression suicide with having something as simple as the idea of like antibiotics. She was like okay you've got some kind of infection
 now we got a way that we can wipe that affection out the infection out all everything going to kill everything everybody everything that's keeping you healthy too and and you start taking more and more of them and Angie create like serious long-term health problems so any case that's a principal that's you know kind of plays out is is that this is something that like a wise person like I mentioned earlier trying to read the patterns in life ever try not to just run blonde
is it in some kind of comedy of errors in life slow down a little bit or here's a problem I keep trying to dress it with a materialistic formula but maybe it's act maybe nature is forcing me to slow down and approaches in Italian if it went as you were sick and that way may have something to do with going Within Myself and see what I may need to let go of for instance this might this may be exactly what I needed to hear before going to the Brimfield Market when should I be respectful of agencies to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you this Trooper most human being into mother saraswathi that goddess of learning and she let be off today of the author not stuff
I'll give it to you too much locate doctor about Thursday night sticky by regular attendance and class in the box with Tom and my rendering service to the pier to go to use all that is troublesome to the heart we can eradicate it 11:00 service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with Transit at the songs we established as in a revocable fact that has my issue I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are open in my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I have for my base and sees at their Lotus feet reading from the shoe my bag with Tom Candice 7 chapter 9 text 17 word a hotspot run exciting spot here what's going on
 can't remember I know it's good to just do just This ferocious form of Lord Vishnu who just killed this
V evil evil Mystic King
 and torn apart then out the Lord in the storm of the Ferocious lion we are literally tore him apart in the form of a lion I don't know if the if the corpse is still on his lap but he has moved around he's got he's still wearing the intestines around his neck I mean I see and test and all the time and my cats are like mini North Lorna string is there tripping animals apart I walk out every morning to just check the weather and there's like intestines is strung out all over my mat you're welcome mat that is like covered in intestines on the regular
 so yes I can imagine this right now no different Universal leaders kind of step forward and made a quick prayer but none of them he did he say
you know how hot he still breathing heavy and angry
 and nobody's been able to kind of appease him
 until Lord Burma you know that it was a wise Sage then the grandfather of all the city he pushed a little products and come on you're the one he came for you go talk to her and I was just the wisdom is just flowing from this little boy he's he's got a deeper understanding by life about reality about the universe about God he understands it all on a deeper level than everyone else I was offering their prayers and some really important life lessons are coming out
 all right that's exciting oh great one
 a supreme Lord because of the combination because of combination with pleasing and displeasing circumstances and because of separation from them one is placed in the most regrettable position within the
Heavenly or hellish planets
 by the way that might sound very far fast if you're new to the show when you hear about a Heavenly Planet hell is with him what we talked about listen if it's just too big of a pill to swallow
 you can just look at your own life we've been in Heavenly places in our life but things are just working out smooth and I'm in the flow and then we've been some hellish place is my wife where things are just like tragic we've been through some tragedies in this life okay just a place is in this world summer more Heavenly some of their hellish God yes
 heavenly
 you ever been to Newark
 Hellas as if one is placed in the most regrettable position within Heavenly or hellish planets as if burning in a firefly lamentation of their many remedies
by which to get out of miserable life any such remedies in the material world are more miserable
 then the miseries themselves what if you are like living in some horrible horrible place where there's danger at every step you don't think it's better to get out of that position okay we'll talk about that person over so therefore I think that the only remedy is to engage in your service, me and struck me in such service I get the gist of it that what department is uncontrolled a great talk with the other day because our debate against Rodger you did a lot of charts for people to listen to this show and we were talking about it and we interviewed him at an interview they are you talking about other people's charts
 yeah this person is charged up to
quickest to buy Insider info and consumer please tell me and if you if you listen to whatever interviews he had a really fascinating you know if he was a doctor head of a head of a medical center and one of his doctors got busted
 I don't even remember how much I'm allowed to say but and heat they took him down and they put him in jail not his doctor him cuz he was responsible and it was one of these things were don't worry you're going to get out of it and he didn't he had to do time and I think I think because they decided they needed to set an example so I can't remember what it was it's in our he wasn't really you know whatever the DEA Felton example needs to be set to prevent this for the future and although he really had no intention to commit a crime right so okay so my point is he was in a horrible situation and enduring lot he just told me this little
text Rick piece of info I hope I'm not going to finish it but it was it was time for him to get out but it was during a lockdown lockdown and they had to put him because you know the days of a lockdown you had to quarantine first so it may quarantined him in solitary confinement it was like it was miserable but but but I I said I said to him
 you know what happened to that have the wrong I have the wrong person in prison anyway I think one but the Portland think the point is the same though once we accept okay you know what I'm going to be I'm here and I'm just going to deal with it then you're almost free from it I don't think I'm going to get out of here I'm going to make it out of here if I could only get out of here
somewhere else then pain becomes more excruciating yeah I had another attempt to come to terms with her circumstance rather than yes costly trying to fight them
 exactly exactly and all you can do is end is work on how you're relating to your mind today work on how you're relating to your health today to your body to your thoughts today and and sleep how is Master going to everyone should go back and listen to that there's two good interview as we did with Rowdy case to us I have it I have a very nice guy who is also in prison for 5 years and it was one of those things he should have been out and it was an Indian prison
 a list of film of any it was like he should have it out and I said how did you deal with it because I suffered for three years because everybody kept on telling me I was going to
out in a week I was going to be out of the week so I just sat and anxiety and then finally I accepted I'm never getting out of here and he goes and then I would know is it like what you said about the boat you know when you said the thing about the boat remind me this was it saying is only two days you do when you go to prison today you go in and the day that you go out was that mean this two days you got to learn to come to terms with it you know the other shift I go in what time is today's you know like how many years are you doing it in jail you know two days there you go in and the day you go out
 I don't get it how can I put traffic in other words there's two shifts that take place is a shift when you go in and there's a ship that when you go out and if you just come to terms with it it's just like that's it you know but if you're constantly thinking like oh my God I'm suffering in her how can I ever get out all the phone and I were out if you dwell on that then
like a very long-term but if you just go in deal with it go out deal with it you know it's like it's like two days I to shifts that got to do with what you're saying cuz I provide said although there are many remedies by which to get out of miserable life any such remedies in the material world or more miserable than the movies and stuff I don't believe that he's coming on full-on Taoist here is going to go on to live as a king and to be responsible in to deal with different kind of circumstances that come up so that's there but I think there's truth in the idea is it saying recognize this truth and learn to this is where discernment has come in this is where wisdom has coming should I try to ship this circumstance is that my duty right now is that the wisest path or perhaps
 there's no need to Hap's the ship needs to be inside me and perhaps the world moves this way
so that I do make these ships right so that I do go with it when when I mention that the world is rigged and that it's working you in a particular way for a particular purpose what is the is there a purpose to my circumstances and rather than resist them
 nnn find that the way that the that it's rigged is it it still gets more complicated and it sometimes more painful rather than go down that you know path of you know, calleros maybe I just learned that there needs to be a just been made internally and really this life is a passive mean making these internal justments internal adjustments and I'm resisting that growth
 I think that's what the towers were getting our philosophy of our body philosophy up I'm not saying that it
that it's Tire like this Taoist idea what what do they said that their principles of inaction Simplicity and living in harmony with nature that's amazing but they say they saw happiness or Supreme goodbye sir by severing themselves completely free from worldly interest and passionate desires I don't know if you know we say what you don't necessarily have to sell yourself entirely well from the world let's say or in one sense even worldly interest but we have to put those worldly interest in the right context have to understand them in the right context and in such a way we're not resisting the internal growth that were meant to that were meant to experience through
 through on addressing ourselves rather than trying to adjust the externals I like that I think you should read the commentary on this road with I'm 17 yeah
 write a will
I'm getting some good realization from this verse the Lord after the death of his father was with Shirley very opulent a lot would have inherited his father's property which extended throughout the world but prolonged Mirage was not inclined to accept such material opulence or whether one is in a heavily or hellish planets where is Rich or poor where is Rich or poor man's son material conditions are everywhere there's no condition of life therefore no condition of life is that all pleasing
 if one wants the uncontaminated pleasure Blissful life he must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord
 right cuz it just is going to satisfy my ego and we know that won't satisfy me you're right the more I try to satisfy my ego the Mormon pain Satisfy My Soul
 if you happy
it's a it's a simple math what a poor man is rich he may be better situated but to come to that position he had to accept many miseries the fact is that in material you know I know so many people like that are my age that they've done so much work in the material world and sometimes your work really hard to build something and then
 all that you've worked for
 yeah it is just to get a little security the fact is that immature life whether one is miserable happy both conditions are miserable and want to actually ones that have big statement we should probably spent a month to keep reading okay if you want to actually wants happy Blissful life one has become Krishna conscious conscious or subconscious and constantly engage in the transit of the 11:00 service of the Lord that is the real remedy the entire world is under the illusion that people will be happy by advancing and materialistic measures to 10
correct the miseries of condition life but this attempt will never be successful
 we still have spun businesses like this whole business just like I was listening to a good gardening podcast yesterday Mara an industry that make plant fertilizers they make compost they make potting mix you know they make a raised bed mixes and it's got myself a 5 lb bag of compost food are good for you to know that good for you to you you bought into their Matrix my friends about this podcast is so simple the best things for mulch you just go and get the guidance of water is Garden he just keeps leaves on his soil the point being the leaves break down and the leaves become part of the soil to riches the soil and it is like the simplest guarding nothing's ever what
cuz you never Waters he never Waters cuz he's constantly just throwing his entire yard is a big moldy mess but it's part of our idea of what a beautiful garden is you know but he's got like a little food for us anyway but yeah it but we live in a world that tries to sell us things constantly in there spin-offs of things you do you need a hanging planter you need you need, most of the stuff is just like watching stuff there's so much stuff is just growing we got you don't have to plant it just figure out what you can eat that grows in your yard
 we complicate their lives there's wild even to drive from our house to Chatham there's wild apple trees all over the place you see them on the side of the road while Apple's well pears are okay anyway you could bite in the fact is the material I play one is busy
if one wants happy life plus 4life okay that is the real remedy the entire world is under the illusion that people will be happy by bazzi materialistic measures you counteract the miseries of condition life but this attempt will never be successful cuz to bus stop by in your mulch Humanity must be trained to engage in the transit at the 11:00 service to the Lord that is the purpose of Krishna Consciousness movement there can be no happiness in changing one's material conditions for everywhere there is trouble and misery good morning good morning. Are you up and then we walked another hundred listeners the fact is that a material life whether one is miserable or happy both conditions are miserable
 yeah there's a lot of ways will confront it here's one way tell me what you think of this okay do you like this you take it and you run with it the nature of according to vedanta
the nature of spirit is that at Eternal unchanging
 the nature is better to say on changing because the material energy is also Eternal but it's eternally changing right so okay so spirit and spiritual energy is unchanging matter or material energy is ever-changing never change or is this ever-changing now if you seek your happiness within the realm of the ever-changing
 can you actually be free of misery like takes it for example
 let's say you recognize who was feeling stress
 you know do do what whatever circumstances he was in and he found an escape where he was able to visit a secluded Island beautiful beach
 he's sitting on the beach and beautiful son nobody's there.
Urban and he's got a pina colada right there he's actually really enjoying life I've done this before sounds the Pina Colada pina colada an alcoholic or is it it is incredible mocktail version of one I will make you that's why you said that in front of your in front of your altar in front of DB's right now I'll make you a pina colada Bubba are you a man of your word yes I am alone with that arrangement
 every 10 minutes
 someone was going to come along and just full-on smack you across the face would let let's say even like a u and an impediment that are like like a like a rather young and I don't know something that really hurt
 so amount of traffic
Milan but there's a person there slaps me repeatedly on a regular basis yes you know it was going to come every 10 minutes even with every half an hour you knew that this very painful
 smack is coming now now he smacks you and then he goes away and you're right back in that peaceful circumstance
 but you know he's coming back
 yeah this is called the what you get when you go into the war in a post traumatic stress syndrome you can't you're always it's everything is beautiful but you're afraid you're going to step on a Lego that you could we describe your situation there would we describe your situation as miserable you have this is miserable I mean that with everything I know I'm constantly like suffering from knowing that I just keep having to endure repeated pain that's material life
and I am going to use this analogy I appreciate it but I'm not going to go right back at it in this it's a beautiful
 Minefield you walk into a tropical beautiful mind field is it actually pleasurable you're the most beautiful place with rivers waterfall just fruit trees and like was off but then your dad's I'm not necessarily, babe I think mine was a little better remind me to send again the fact is that a material life whether one is miserable or happy
 those conditions are miserable even your happiness there's a sense of miss you know if you're unless you're just totally blind
 you have to realize that I'm living in a world of pain it's the Dilemma of how do you find Eternal happiness in the temporary world
 how do you potty train
obviously that's that that's the Rubik's Cube we're struggling with the best we can do is be a stable and I think most people get this if you want to stay low relationship on a stable living condition but stable food we want we want some stability in her life and we want something that feels Eternal I want to feel like I feel good this is my home but underlying that the devotee constantly cultivates that remember
 this is all temporary and I think that's the best we can do we don't have to be depressed that it's all temporary we have to just be moving our investment to the Eternal to the spiritual realm to the spiritual to the spiritual realm or else for setting ourselves up there is no permanence in a in a temporary world I can't feel safe if I got a beach house that's made of sand and the Tide's coming in I'll never feel safe
the most beautiful beach house but if I'm right on the edge of the ocean and the beach is made and the house itself was built out of sand and sand castle that is right so this is the stuff I think our underlying theme as devotees is listen the world's temporary understand that get it be dependent on Krishna and to try to keep things as long-lasting as you can friendships relationships homes regulate your diet regulate your son's gratification regulated
 and then but lean into the strip because things are things could turn on a one on a hairpin turn at any moment and they do and they sure so imagine dragon. He's on this one Island
 but you said nothing you say that like you pitiful
now imagine dragon off his on his Island getting smacked every 10 minutes
 Imagine David Charles Wilson is on a neighboring Island where there is no such smacking going on from David Charles Wilson perspective
 if you ask him do you know Somerset oh yeah and you don't recognize over there on that other island is it the other way to get smacked
 I'll have a miserable happiness there it's like it's beautiful now oh no no over here there's no smacking it's like to know if there's none of that so so another way to look at the sentences from the spiritual perspective from the liberated perspective
 that even the happiness in this material world is miserable right what's a speak of if you could understand what if you weren't on a beautiful island in your getting smacked have you like oh my God and that's why you know the monastics are like what you and I
the monks you actually practice giving all the all the Comforts of the world let him go you just say okay you know what I'm going to figure out how to be happy with nothing I'm going to happen I'm going to figure out how to be happy without a bed with that in all the things that people needed to for comfort you like your bad on a bit o bad I said you don't you like your freedom of doing it whatever you want whenever you want can't do that you like sleeping in you never do that like Santa plate can't do that like go to the movies watching TV listen to music can't see that they have a girl's night so I can't do anything you can't eat it yeah and now can you be happy what does speak of someone to take on more austerity we're going to chant or where we going to Chantry to sit on a cold marble floor for 2 hours and you get a chance that sounds like
 if we weren't into this weird sound like that's the worst thing it sit on a cold marble floor
it's miserable and so you're left to find pleasure that's why I like the cold plunging Community because they have to really change their mind of sense gratification no one wants to go do a cold plunge they're always like okay here I got to face off with my mind again or cold showers is the same thing no one likes to do it but there's some higher benefit from doing it in the same sense that it in the monastic life I'm going to strip away all my external happiness that I get on a regular basis and I would have nothing and I'm going to figure out now how to find how to figure out this puzzle material existence howdy happy with nothing
 and then and then if I lose everything it's okay I understood was never mind in the first place so even if you have a home and a family and you have stuff that you could feasibly lose we just understand we love these things but we don't possess these things that any minute they can leave don't make that your comfort make God your comfort
 Apple

 xr18 next one because of bottle a conception of life and body Souls neglected and not cared for by you cannot do anything for their betterment
 whatever remedy is that accept although perhaps temporarily beneficial or certainly important in permanent for example of father and a mother cannot protect their child a position in medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient and a boat on the ocean can I protect the drowning man we see many times they fail
they give something can't say don't give me anything but it's it's not like that is the ultimate makes more right than Krishna wants to kill you no one can protect you and Kristen wants to protect you no one can kill you we should have happened so many times I just heard of a Titanic baby baby there's like a bomb that went off in a baby was like shocked like a landed completely safe and was like oh and then cuz it was in a
 that was a tornado or something the baby is going to be a tornado that shot but it was in the child car seat or something and it got blown up into the tree it amazing how your death experiences
or people like so many like you see like a train there's a famous one guy van India and he trains coming up 11th hour he jumped on his motorcycle right but the train is an interest in promoting a motorcycle and oh my God anyway there's a lot of these a lot and you think not only is there a god you think like
 if Christian wants you to Dad
 you're going to die there's people who died from weird situations everything's great everything's wonderful the choke on a corn chip you know or just people who like they should have been dead and they saved the crazy people we hung out with in our childhood but but you know again he's repeating that whatever remedies they accept although perhaps temporarily beneficial you give me that much is certainly in permanent and ends in you know let's look at the circumstances he write his is Father's Day
trails are like all over the room and now his father made all the material adjust the his father was saying I'm going to manipulate this this world in such a way or my power and my enjoyment are unparalleled in unending
 and in order to do that he tried to make an adjustment through performing extreme austerities for a very long time
 and through that he was able to adjust things in a certain way right you got all these medications you won't be killed by man or animal you can't be killed in day or night indoor outdoor excetera excetera he thought he had adjusted it you know to a materialistic path
 and yet here you is just like you know big bloody mess like all over the room he was able to adjust the temporarily but in the end
 and that was a life of misery you know from provides perspective
 and it just the whole thing just kind of stands it's a no
creation of that some of that.
 Of the the what's the word I'm looking for like the
 captain of the word but like the impossibility of the feet how futile material and a smile even the person that succeeded the most said it had the greatest ability at it let him miserable angry life in in ended up just slaughtered
 it's yeah yeah yeah yeah everybody gets slapped down everybody Mara before we go out in consumption land clearing to the cockpit out our discovering announce pond
