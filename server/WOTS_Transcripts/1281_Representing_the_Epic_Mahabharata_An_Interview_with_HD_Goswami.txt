I am a little closer is an expert Diplomat among other things and he is very well known in the city I mean everyone from you know when they are all the official City so he is actually created a very very positive image for us as a Hari Krishna Science Institute potastic
 fantastic could mean it's amazing a neighborhood where I grew up watching Netflix making breakfast getting the kids off to school and here we have a house load like an ashram of scientists and it's quite impressive
 must be great on Halloween
really excited to get into the Mahabharata with me and Mara and cuz scuba have been I have been reading it and we feel like it's sort of like the Keystone tying all our puronics stories together especially how you just break apart set your patties life and fit her in with all the with all the house she relates to the demons and why the avatara's born in and it could still be wants to dive right into the questioning because I don't think we've kind of really friend this out yet that it's just I believe just released and maybe just releasing its audiobook in about to be released as soon to be releasing its hardbound Edition
 Mirage is just kind of released a new translation of the Mahabharata called the great part
available now for people
 it's available in audio and it's been published by Monday brass and should be out very soon and people find the audio version where
 Google links in the show notes as well Google audio the bar in the great Bard and of course Punk to munch that's one of the great Classics so tomorrow you know we're going out tonight were fortunate to kind of get a sneak preview of this new work and immediately you know we both been relishing my part to for for several units 35 years or so
 Auburn immediate Leon picking up your dish and it fell
different
 and I was trying to put my finger on exactly why
 in an exciting way felt different you know I and a very Dynamic win and I noticed that in your preface you mentioned that the mob part is commonly kind of framed as a struggle between two royal families and that there's truth in this depiction but that it's really weaving three different levels together there there is that Earthly Royal Dynasty battle going on but you mention that it's there's also like a cosmic battle going on and then there's a spiritual level to understand it as well could you speak a little bit to that
 do we get in in all of our letters of agua tell Mahabharat another literature's
is something like a cosmic Village
 can people talk about global village it's kind of like a cosmic Village so that for example when there are great events great marriage at Great sacrifice or or even sometimes a great War people will come from many different worlds great sages Davis or what we called demigods and and they know each other so there's a type of cosmic Village People are interconnected
 just like to get one simple example if we look at ancient history thousands of years ago what Scholars know is that people traveled a lot more than we imagined and actually we're much more Cosmopolitan so for example they found Viking graveyards outside Beijing and so similarly
 and the typical ID
sort of like a hick or something as he know some of that never goes outside their own little town or their own Farm
 so and they don't really know what the wider world is so in a sense we are the hits nowadays with all of our signs and everything because we have a type of Iron Age you know now we have course Digital Science but it's still very primitive and so are thousands and thousands of years ago when the world was in a better State and actually off all the great engine rider say that weather is Homer and he's at the two great Greek writers they say the world used to be more advanced people have greater power and so basically the ancient take on history was that we're coming we're going down not up each other and
 the Migos repeat your questions this is what
I'm about to put this way when I read it I thought you mentioned these three different levels like a normal you're picking up them apart and reading and the Earth is 5000 years ago actually about 5126 years ago was it was a battlefield and World War there were certain places like done there certain places were very very famous battles took place but the battles were for the world you know that people were fighting for all of Europe they were fighting a sentence for for the world war and yet the battlefield took place on specific places so in that way a battle took place on Earth and the mob Arts is very clear about this but it hasn't come out in so many dishes the Moon and the Earth was just the battlefield
 and so they were actually fighting for the universe
and an old way of course the third level is that this whole historical series of events was orchestrated in the sent by Krishna because he was coming down and Christmas so merciful that he he saves us through entertainment I mean think of the Marvel Universe I mean the other so-called mutants the Marvel universe or DC is nothing compared to Mahabharata and so ultimately all these events Were Meant to lead us to spiritual enlightenment so these three things so it took place on the earth there is a dynastic struggle on Earth
 at the rat v a revolving around Dharma then it's actually Earth has the battlefield and and then ultimately it has a spiritual meaning
 I think when we picked it up
stroganoff and I was struck on how it spoke on that Cosmic level
 maybe even primarily you know which was yes new Force which was different people don't realize because the eighth cancel The Bob & Tom the store is in the store as the start of this Celestial good and bad guys who wear churning the ocean and milk through his nectar with which gives you extraordinary longevity
 the word for longevity by the way in Sanskrit is out here that's we get our Aveda how to prolong your life and so
 so the the demon somehow the asuras capture the nectar so Krishna came down he tricked the asuras because basically the whole universe be in danger if they got this powerful beverage food and so then was given to the God so then a battle
what happened is that the very briefly that. But Dave has one with the help of Krishna however Did you sort of didn't give up I mean I mean the Dave has good guys won the battle not the war and so to understand how the Mahabharat takes place you have to understand something about the nature of insurgencies
 military Insurgency so basically an Insurgency needs let's say that particular group you know to be an army it can be a political and armed political contingent they lose to the government there defeated so they don't give up what they do is they go to a remote place where they can regroup their armies in again
 a march on the capital so here are some examples of going remote places and shut you know via the Muslim Rebels went to the mountains in Sudan they went to the South into the desert and horse that eventually be
southern Sudan and South Sudan a different country in Colombia farc be the terrorists in Colombia they went into the jungles and so you see this that that
 the people Insurgent they go into remote places where they will cannot be found or won't be suspected to be there they regroup in the end then they see no so to speak march on the capital so 5,000 years ago when the when the asuras were defeated they created an Insurgency and so the plan was to find some remote sleepy planet that no one would suspect and turn it into a death star literally they intubate shows here that they chose her for a few reasons never one has heard of a lower-middle-class planet and you know and also the reason the Earth at that time was so sleepy is because all this is happening in the app
map of Percheron pass your arm of course you know killed all the Warriors who had become their breaking the law instead of protecting the law for Life Rogue Kings and so then there was a problem because there were no Kings and then you get Anarchy which is not a great political system and then you have all these young ladies the warrior class ladies were marriageable age where they can't find husbands so it was a crisis and the warrior that the governing class had to be regenerated where these Warrior or Royal young ladies approach very pure brahmins would give them Sons to regenerate the governing class one unintended consequence of that is because all the new Kings the first few generations of Kings
 were they were very from
and so because they were very romantical and because parts are I'm kind of cleanse the Earth there for the amount Bart was very emphatic about this is repeated several times
 that does it was like a r e reappearance of assets are you go if it was a typical descriptions no one stole no one lied no one committed violence and so basically the Kings had nothing to do if he came almost a ceremonial post and so you see is very clearly in the Cooter Dynasty because they were traditionally and that the you know as they said in back on the times of Magna Carta in Europe and England Primo entry parties first people of if you hear Empire in the Mahabharata the valve time don't think Octavius Caesar you know it's actually because there's there's no there's no record of any
begin for interfering in the internal affairs of another kingdom is basic keep the peace that you do stop one country from attacking another and and make sure you know you don't have evil rulers harassing the people and so because everything is going so well pratibha the father sent a new it was a great crew King so how did he spend his 10 years gang he sat on the bank of the Ganges did yoga and meditated for the good of the world so
 so the tovia singer is worth liking a licking their lips so to speak because here's a planet here's a planet where the Kings could not be more naive they could there not at all on their guard they don't suspect anything it's like they think said to you guys come again and so therefore the aftermath of first-round they did they decide we're going to take over the planet and use it as a death star literally Brown
so now they learn some lessons of the past because in the Mahabharata it's explain the Dharma is not just like a rule in the log book somewhere it's actually a cosmic power and that is actually the the Dharma as a power of the universe went to the Far East with Buddhism a lot of a to culture travel to the Far East with Buddhism and then and then it was said as it appeared there in in in Japanese martial art philosophy it was studied by
 George Lucas and it became the force in Star Wars
 the Force is Dharma because because for example the Mahabharata it said that Dharma rakshita raksha T when Dharma is protect protected it protects and Dharma hensy that Houston and when it is injured it injures and so it's a thermos Ashley a cosmic force and
inappropriate explain the word Dharma for the router to sustain like Christians chapter Adara he holds the chakra or getting Hardy hold the mountain so darling he's that was sustained in civilized life so anyway so that the the asuras are very clever because they realized they were they believed they were real, my mom says it's so they were totally, Lee wants of us wait so they believe that the bank account and if you pile up a lot of credits and then you can know you can spend something and so their strategy this was their strategy and you have to understand this to understand the Mahabharata
 is sort of strategy was that the first of all
 they had a plan to literally inherit the earth
 because when when they start to invade and there's a scene in the Baba time work
where boo me goes to Grandpa and is very I won't talk about it now but it's very significant that she bypassed Indra and went straight to Brahma that's also an important thing but I will talk about that some other time and so bhoomi went to Braham high they go to Vishnu will meet me and stood the Earth Mother Earth and unn wide Island was in Sam's for this way to 3 white Island yes
 and so they listen to tell Grandma that the asuras have invaded and I want the Dave has I say Dave is because technically in English demigod means someone like the bond of us who have one Celestial parents and one Earthly parents
so there to take birth and what's interesting is that the vicious says to the Dave has Yahoo Souper Jenny and Tom take birth among the others what that means is that if you are a higher being like a David or an Asura you have the power to choose your Bertha and on a lower Planet example if you're really rich person if you go to sort of a middle-class neighborhood you can buy any house you want that neighborhood so in the same way if you're coming from a higher Planet you can choose your birth and so therefore the plan was to take birth in the greatest dynasties and literally to inherit the Earth 2 in her in her crate Kingdom at the same time if that means it's really important
 to understand how the asuras had a
Google modern sort of a assist worldview and a worldview
 because, my mom says it is with the courses at Harvard actually hold Riverside yeah I wasn't converted though because that the food wasn't great and this, is that the universe is basically a mechanism which it sounds familiar but there are subtle physical laws Nevada is the sort of inconceivably free-floating manual to the universe it's like the universe comes with a user's guide and that's The Vedas and The Vedas are simply to self existing uncreated unspoken by anyone
this just as information because of her example if you're a scientist you believe that in a microbiological level be like ridiculously absurdly sophisticated computer code that built into cells is just there the universe just evolved in a way so if there's like the super sophisticated information going back and forth because we now know that Evolution takes place not mechanically but by transfer of information so till they believe that
 and so therefore in the car belongs to the philosophy they have different categories they're like the super categorizer and so that the dent the davises then he got himself are put in the same category as paraphernalia like a big spoon do you know a little pot of Geeta Kapoor in in lean and all that is just the gotchas Personnel devotion not required
it's like if you go to a buffet to get a driver's license you don't have to bring gifts for the bureaucrat behind the counter if you if you meet all the requirements and you fill out the form then the person has to give you a driver's license so the Mimosa fluffy is that the Davis or simply Cosmic bureaucrats
 and the real point is if you can Master the laws of the universe you can easily overwhelm the David so getting to the point just just to complete this right quickly so that the asuras believed and believe that God that rather than Krishna you know Vishnu being the source of the power of the sacrifice is exactly the opposite actually it's the sacrifice and empowers Vishnu like stuff like a battery based on the Dharma going on on the Earth
exactly so that if you so that if you perform of Vedic sacrifice you create power and then by chanting different mantras you channel the power and an example of this is given in the sixth chapter can throw the ball the time which is also in the rig-veda the story of Rich up so that when I find all the details to watch that was really mad at Andrew killed his son so he decided to perform his powerful dating sacrifice it would create a bee that would kill Indra and invaded sacrifices or in general the power is in the actual sound does the sound that contains the power
 what have you found the sides is the knowledge that contains the power in the Piranhas that's the story in the lessons that can be learned or so
 so therefore as as as explaining the ball gown is very famous story from The Vedas that went West it was chanting the mantras which activator release all this power he was supposed
how to say
 in the shot through which means the sacrifice who creates the mortal enemy of Indra but instead you. Maybe a little sleepy or had too much for lunch or whatever it is that the wrong way instead of saying in the shelter he said in Russia through which means end Roby the mortal enemy that will kill this beat
 so therefore because they believe the power comes with a sacrifice and then is channeled if they could kill
 device never brahmins
 Vista would no longer get power you'll be weakened and they could kill him and so therefore it for example Council in the 10 Canto when he finds out that the day of us through their own says their expansion have already taken the person the Earth especially among the elders and so then, it gives the order kill all the Brahmin has kill all
babies that were born in the last 10 days until why kill the brahmas actually if you know the contest it was an order to kill device nah Brahmin because they are the ones were channeling power into this new funding to their philosophy very interesting and then to kill the brahmins do that then the question arises I had to put all the pieces together we really feel like after reading it would like to get this more I have been reading this for years but now I actually get it so then the next question they would have had to ask themselves is that if we kill brahmins that's like really bad karma and we're going to just get a burn through our bank account of Good Karma which empowers us so therefore they decided that well there is such a thing which is in the shop stirrers which is pushing Dharma the Dharma that an insult to the Beast kills a human being that's not bad, because it's a beast and so they therefore
 summary of the book
yeah the loophole exactly yeah it's all about you know you having a good lawyer so that was in the midst of all that that's why I blew me that's why mommy went to Grandma bypassing Indra because in drug couldn't deal with this it was beyond him so she had to go to run hot and so that was the sort of strategy and so Krishna came and variance in because if you look at how Christmas pastimes are he actually thread the needle inside the Hail Mary pass where where Krishna actually preserve Dharma because Christian says nagida the forces of darkness and stopping our entire chapter 7 I come to you know to re-establish Dharma and so he he plays the Astoria game
 I don't go and all the details not time but he actually dress the needle he he follows all the rules of Dharma and
ultimately annihilate them and is it all of this is going on
 and in the Mahabharata but you have to kind of have the
 what's your your translation did so well for me so it was it did kind of give me a a much clearer or more thorough understanding and even like not only an understanding of this Cosmic aspect but it was kind of really seen through that Cosmic lens and it felt different but you know another thing that felt different what do you know the Mahabharata so
 large epic literally that you know when you're doing a translation obviously it's going to be a bridge to some degree and and I'm sorry. Only averaged about was just that this would give you the opportunity to come
started the way you want to choose your own starting point of what we're we're going to begin to tell the story how I'm going to tell the story I'm going to frame it out and it's your your telling of it started with
 very interesting in the most sympathetic presentation of such of a tea that I that you know I've come across so it's it's your starting this story through the lens of a young girl I was growing up in a fishing Village and she's associating with these Yogi's inside was that live across the river and I thought that was a very unique approaching did you speak to them how you came to that to that idea thank you thank you have a great question. I love such a beauty we all do you know just glanced by her is so much she wasn't not so much importance was given to her
yeah yeah I had to marry her and end in the Hindu take on such as completely wrong it's just like if you any Hindi movie will show nard ammonia as a court jester which is absurd okay so first of all in a sense I start with such a booty butt butt in since the earliest thing I talk about is that comes little later the story of King bustle and the reason in a sense that historical narration starts of us who is because the Mahabharat itself says the different stages of different starting points even five thousand years ago the Mahabharata was too big for most people to read
 and so even the first Abridged edition of the Mahabharata was done by the answer and that's described in the Mahabharata but as far as the central Story begins with King Buster but I jump ahead of them then go back to King Buss it
and
 who is Father father and and also
 according to Encyclopedia Britannica
 80% 80% of the Mahabharat that is not on the central story is what's called hupac Gianna's secondary stories and instructions that end basically month what's your area as in Braha Mudbug odia he had an edition of the Mahabharata obviously in Sanskrit eight hundred years ago and he wrote a book about the Mahabharata read the relevant parts and is after the course and Charlie is said that the text is Thoroughly corrupted I mean if you in terms of text critical remarks I do we have
we have an original text is this a corrupted text mud which are is is practically more critical than than Scholars today and so I want to say a word about the text you know I mean I mean don't worry don't get depressed about this because ultimately nard of money saved the day and he instructed the ass to get it right and so The Bob & Tom is actually a lot of it is a retelling of the Mahabharata but from a pure perspective
 somudro Charlie explained that it's just still filled with interpolations things stuck in that aren't original extrapolations thing's taken out transpositions of text like modern scholarly analysis through text and this one important thing about a hundred years ago all the greatest sounds good is in the
from India from Europe even couple guys in America they decided to apply text critical Scholars of the Mahabharata in the west you have these very important ancient books most important to say was the Bible and then there is no the Greek and Greco-Roman literature but they were different copies are trying to find out can we is it possible to scholarship to go back to an original text and and they were successful day you know there was part of the consensus that we were able to do that by various scholarly method and so they said hey this is why we do this let's look for that used to determine where the or Mahabharat to the original Mahabharata so all the great Sanskrit is in the world got together
 and the and the chief editor was vicious conquer Indian vaishnava so at the end of it after years of of of
he is in there now so he announced in his very famous very long introduction to the series cuz it's multi-volume series we have it here in the library actually that it is not possible three said that the powers of academic scholarship are insufficient to recoup recover an original Mahabharata is gone we cannot recover an original Mahabharata and so he even said all we're giving you here
 is the oldest Mahabharata that we in of the week and speculate about and even then it's not certain so another words is sedating the Mahabharata when Monday and Scholars tried to date them all of the bar too because there's certain words in it like it made me further Sum King that they know live that's a two thousand years ago or whatever it's absurd because the greatest Scholars
this is not the original Mahabharata so therefore we want to be honest the Monday's gone absolutely not the slightest idea how old it is
 and it is evident that it's in over five thousand years but the bhagavad-gita they can verify is what Monday's God is always say like almost all of them and any like class you taking any universal say well we know the Mahabharat at the bhagavad-gita cannot be older than lets say 24 twenty-three hundred years ago 20 20 years ago because I can find places in the Gita you find the word Nirvana usually with the term Brahma Nirvana because Nirvana is a negative word near means without some means Nirvana oh no it's stopping the current of rebirth and so on so Christina does it possibly Brahma Nirvana everyone teaches this that there for the Gita is more recent than the and Buddhism
so on the most prestigious indology conference no Discussion Group in the world all the most famous and Chris in the world Mall the best universities I pose the question cuz I'm on that, I said I said logically there three possibilities one the Gita borrowed the word from Buddhism to Buddhism borrow the word from the Gita three they both independently use the word so do we have any hard evidence you do not you do not a bunch of in a very special place we have hard evidence that the Gita bar different Buddhism and the reply I got from all the world's biggest colors was deafening silence one had any idea why they were teaching it
 but they all did and no one knew why it's just because well so and so dr. so-and-so said
professor says yes of course so stuff
 am I going far afield of your squirrel a walk the dog chases a squirrel goes off topic but often times the squirrels are the most attractive parts of the blue taking the dog for a walk so we'll go wherever you want geez notoriously stupid choice for keeping us on track and I'm notorious for that wandering into the forest to I am presenting myself to be kept on track okay okay well then maybe we can come back to such a busy what with you. I just said I was going to stop for a second and just give an appreciation for HD goswami I mean young age and at a very young age is only a few people left have done that and they're still around and then he like opened
America which is quite impressive cuz he is a strong command of many languages including Spanish and Portuguese the open up Brazil Argentina and then when I left the planet he and his team finished the translation of the Shrew my dog with Tom so the highlights of your career this is just the highlights of the Highlight Reel Michelle okay how you got there while you start
 okay this is I'll tell you exactly how it happened
 I felt liberated by mudcrutch area
 because when my crotch area says most of the original versus are lost and the verses are laughed at
corruption throughout I thought oh my God freedom I can tell the real story now and so I was going to tell you one story witches in the Mahabharata which I just thought I'm not going to tell this story okay here's the story
 there was a king who how he became a king he just anyway it's another whole story but so they're in his kingdom of shaded he's a cruel King but somehow he was ruling Shady when he was in the Cooter Dynasty and so in his Capital City there was a river which means Pearl River to Pearl River ran through the capital and there was a big hill next to the river the hill was conscious and Lusty it was a Lusty Hill yeah I've seen those I mean you've all seen that heart
happened is the hill jumped on the river and raped it
 read about that in the news everyday so the hill jumped on the river and raided and impregnated the river
 and the river gave birth to human child
 what ya a daughter who the kingdom married
 River girl so then
 and so she didn't get a car and this is King faster so then she you know she grew into the age where was appropriate for her to have a child
 and she really wanted a child of the king and says wanted to consummate their marriage and they were really anxious inside the astrologers and Browns finally said okay green light and they were just you know all about doing that but just at that moment just at that moment the ancestor somehow communicated with him or the Elder
and his Elders it's not there's no sense getting them and said you have to do and sacrifice for the ancestors and do that you have to go to the forest and hunt and bring a creature for this non-dutch sacrifice so what would a real person do a real person was a king busted would say I'm all over that but just give me an hour I'm on it right now in 1 hour and I'm out of here but no guests to leave that second so he leave he goes out in the forest to hunt and he can't stop thinking of his wife and he's so adjectives by thinking his wife that he he loses his seed
 but he realizes that this is very valuable because of you think of The Vedic arranged marriages like like that was that was our genes bacon certain chapter 1 varna's Sumter was literally means mixing burn
 and so because if you think about it these arrangement
we're actually sort of like natural genetic engineering engineering these super Jeffrey is insured of ramens generation takes the seed see many pee puts it he puts it in a little leaf packets gives it to a carrier Hawk and of course and send it back to the Capitol because apparently his wife although she's never been faced with this will of course know how to are artificially inseminate herself
 so anyways so the hawk is flying
 and is flying over the river and other birds of prey think that it's some kind of I don't know Mike's or a fast-food meat or something and so they attacked the hawk and the package falls into the river where it's followed swallowed by a big fish who naturally becomes impregnated
 for the human seed and end with twins becomes a
made with twins and that fish is captured by the fisherman who cut it open and discover these humans with nephew think about it I mean how to fish with open fish like chop-chop you but somehow he does a very delicately maybe saw it on the fish it was sort of a naturally pregnant some way and so he's startled to find human twins in a fish's probably you would be also sure until you take them to the king and the King just looked at these human Twins and says oh that's my boy
 that's my boy and so you know how he knew that God only knows so that it's so he names the boy Monty it says I'll make you a prince so he just brings a little child with the tall fish Dory fish tail enemies is okay that's my boy you can become a prince
 but the girl has this like serious body odor problem because she smells like a fish
so the king says you have a whole fish story makes sense of smell a little kind of little sweet moment of you know pseudo Vedic male chauvinism the girl back and then she so then when I read that that's what really triggered me cuz I start a thing wait a second the first thing that really struck me I think is Christian the heart good parents don't give away their children because they have a medical problem sure and he's the emperor she's the emperor's daughter why would he send her to a very low class Village sure something's wrong with this story and as far as
king of the hill and pregnate in the river maybe I'm not going to tell that story so I rather just rejecting it
 rerun for you rather than just rejecting it rather than I really feel like Christmas guiding me and so I came to the conclusion there's something here which is true there's an original story which was actually true that became mythologized
 that's why I began to hunt for the story and then I had to go back to Vassar
 because bus who was born in the cooler Dynasty but often in in in societies there more princess and there are Kingdom to go around that's why they had to Chris by the way to get rid of all these princes that were running amok in your lives if you know don't fight
so he had no Kingdom and therefore he needs to sort of in the in the Zeitgeist the spirit of the times he just went out to the Wilderness to practice yoga cuz he wanted to go to indraloka and so then and he's he's becoming really good he's getting just out to get his Visa
 and then and then enter comes down and Indra tell them Willie Boy let's talk about this because in Dragon of thanks okay maybe he's going to want to be in dry and if it tells me I don't
 don't don't do this don't try to ascend right now he's still young to indraloka you stay on the earth and do your duty here and obviously what bus would have said is I have no Daddy I know Kingdom so endre makes him into tell them I will make you the emperor of the world but not only that he literally got a magic wand and he got a crystal Airship if you go in
show me how cool is that
 I don't know okay
 first of all when Ender wants to deflate an up-and-coming Yogi on the person with an Asura to take out a contract sure he calls these beautiful Celestial girls who always get their guy and just says you don't have a contract go get himself because think about it and you think of any throwing the ball with them were injured personally come to Earth and just talks to some Yamin isn't do that so what's going on and the Crystal Airship and I'm going to
the emperor of the world just because he decided to desist when actually into could have just sent you know one of those men took out what's going on and then it became obvious what's going on in there by that time in his aware that the asuras have already started their invasions and he's going to try to stop it and the way is going to stop it is going to empower human King
 and so and that's why he makes in the a because Shady he is not the Shady was nothing but it's kind of like you know switching the US Capitol to I don't know Nebraska why would you do that and so but the reason he makes him the a it because he's going to be in charge of protecting the Earth and therefore it ties into the central story The Mob artoo has narrative Amnesia by telling the story this morning days and then totally forgets about it about the next year 3000 pages
but that's so that's what happened and so that I kept the story of the
 the girl falling into the river at the risk of her life so would I buy my own realization I mean what I think must have happened is because first of all you know what is it in either what is that walks into Cheney knocks on the palace torn says hi I'm your new king and how does he do that
 and so I realize that was the problem how does he become the key cuz they already have a king
 who turns out when he gets there that the King has died and there's actually the person in charge of the kingdom is his unmarried daughter that's very beautiful young lady
 and so she falls into the river the end there's an avalanche from the hill I mean she's on the hill and there's an avalanche she falls in the river she's going to drown and he says user
 and they get married
because that was in just plan so then as far as setting of a t the reason she simply fishing Village was she is actually because it's in the bottom I don't just imagine anything I stay within the boundaries of the ball with his lordship Tanya certified sure so
 why was she sent to a fishing Village and then I realize there's only one reason that good parents would send their
 daughter and a is only one reason they would send her the fishing Village and that is to save her life because in fact if you if you do the timelines you got to have to figure it out because my barges is kind of become a little chaotic so by the time he is born disorder is already invading the Earth
 and they're monitoring
what's happening they have these Powers exactly the same Powers as the Davis example to show you how the language they're already taking her some stages were already being killed and so it is sort of but they don't tell the people of Earth Not to cause planetary panic
 but the people that are in touch with the David they know the Earth has been invaded the Earth has been compromised and because of it he's going to bring the first avatar to her to begin the counterinsurgency
 Sophia Ashley Begins the counterinsurgency in various ways which I explained so they don't try to kill her so that the Avatar can come they they hire they send her to a place where no one would suspect that an Emperor's daughter would be living
 and even she doesn't know it and everything I do I cannot go alone
with the idea that one of the greatest holy sage has evaded Sage brings an avatar into this world by raping a teenage girl that never sat well with me either yeah I just I don't think so interesting Lee all of South India rejected it because if you look at the different would have called me sentience just different versions of the Mahabharata the differences in different Regional versions newer versions from all over India but the main division would be North and South India I just explained that the idea that be all she did was born on an Islands when a boat part of sharra was the father was the father taught you about to just come to the Back store people don't know sure and that was the idea that
 woman's daughter but she's very frustrated with her life
Desmond wife
 because actually she has Royal Blood and so to make up in a few extra whatever is for her father's you receive roses photo she steers the boat across the gym on the river and so the judge wants to cross the river poor Oscar up and she's like
 crazy beautiful she's very beautiful young girl and so he's in the boat and he just tells her essentially let's just do it
 that's that's what I can do with the corrupted North Indian version and its explicitly said in the Mahabharata At first she sitting here saying are you serious like the other people on both sides of the river what are you so he has like this Hollywood fog machine Okay now what's your problem and it specifically said she agreed because she was afraid he'd
cursor weather in whether a man holds a knife to a girl or a gun or can cursor we can be more dangerous than either of those it still rape
 it's still rape and so-and-so in that story went down to South India they just fixed us up so she said you can't tell that story here
 do it the way they solve it in south of South Indian manuscript is that such unity and Prosser have this you know great Hindu / beta wedding which cord goes on for half of the rest of your life
 and so on and they get married and the whole Cosmic Village come to the wedding you know the demigod of the great sages and everything what really happened
 because we know because you said they were married then why would it be kept a secret and actually
when the crew Dynasty a generation later isn't absolute existential crisis and about to be exterminated with the death of the Javeria that's one sexy daddy finally has to reveal to be that she had a son who can save the date and see if they have a an orthodox South Indian wedding why would it be kept a secret that they had a son
 so anyway so in my view it's true that she but I see / Ashura as a real Sage he understood that was needed there needed to be this Avatar to be born reveal to her the whole Cosmic crisis and
 and also appeared in the younger form because we know for the viola Thomas ages when they when they're going to have intercourse with a lady of the same old kind of I'm not going to I'm not going to have sex with my great-grandfather so when that happens
I just have the power to change into younger bodies
 in order to please the girl so I kept the basic elements but I'm trying to think you know what would real people do what could have really happened to these people don't come off you don't have great Vedic Sage who raped teenage girls and and yet you know you have to worship the brahmins and that's one thing about some of our literature that I I struggle with and that is that you have to Bow Down and Worship people that do really bad things
 and then if you don't approve of that you know you're the bad person
 so if you don't approve of a Great Sage raping a teenage girl you're the bad person
 I don't think that's why I don't give you can put that on the market I think it was going to buy it I mean here we thinking are devotees they go over the world and everyone except they didn't culture a culture in which if you're a great Sage
have the right to rape a young girl
 if you're married you can gamble away your why women are property that you can gamble away with by the way the great personality in the Mahabharata says you can't do that in that person's Christian himself
 when when when the Arjuna and subhadra eloped and women really like back then it turns out the Superbad was expert in driving a war chariot
 do so much for the Unova mousy little dated women in the Mahabharata that when I went to visit the bond of us by the way they had resort areas that's currently on board to the Head Resort Hill stations Hill stations and it was rival took him out into the yard or they went down they have vacation areas by the river and so all the Royals
you know that the nnn indraprastha and then Krishna and his Entourage they went down to the river this resort area and they had all kinds of events including wrestling tournaments and what I found really interesting was at the wrestling tournaments were for the women that like to know if you look at The Vedas than men call women mother know they didn't messages Hindi of course
 that you would say Mater as I say mother mother has peas
 overtime that invaded culture men didn't call all women mother in Les the woman happened to be their mother is one case in all of our
future where a man calls his and mother
 and then call the mother the women were
 just one less I promise this last one this really quickly because I think it's important to know what real faded culture was sure how do I like that concept of calling everyone seeing every woman is your mother or your daughter because a good mission to tell me why I don't like it because I don't believe is my own experience that the only way that you can keep a man from trying to inappropriately seduce a woman is to raise the Specter of incest I find in my old life I know many women you know who to me or like daughters or your friends and you know I don't have to keep incest in my head in order not to jump on them short and so I just think it's kind of but anyway
 there's a
in the Mahabharata there's a scene in the Mahabharata where after Pond is already gotten five sons from Quincy and laundry and he just wants to go for it like because for a King's son for the ultimate collectible
 because that you often don't have a long life expectancy so he's he's trying to press your country you got to call more Davis and she says you're out of your mind you know she basically said you know you want me to have a child everyday Even Heaven and in 33 million a woman must obey her husband whether he's right or wrong
 who is Clint East has basically in your dreams
 you know what country is forget that that's not going to happen so then she gives her arguments and pundits says to get the last word in Yes dear so
 so these are real marriages another way
if you look at the literature carefully they were real people and real marriages as we know some men to get all full of this sort of you know Muslim betak idea and they think they can just get a boss the women around and the marriages don't work actually because they have this
 Winston Falls idea would be to culture is take the kids to dama dromida his wife says you know we're really poor we're not even healthy you have to go to your old school friend Christian is the richest guy in the world now answered, says no I don't want to do that what happens he goes his wife says go he says I don't want to go his wife says that you're going to tell if you actually look at it this was the real abated they were real people they were that the wives of the brahmins you know when Krishna and scoured boys want food and they go to the universe
I won't give him the time of day they were discouraged Christian says go to their wives are much more advanced
 so they go back to the wives and the wives of course just go crazy they want to date them today if they could they put the whole Kitchen on Wheels you know and just drive it there so there and what's interesting story
 is it
 is that every sounds like every possible male authority figure is is there in the scene husband father's you know grown sons older brothers if I can have the whole the whole pack is there the whole gang is there of all the male authority figures and the women just say see you later and they know that obviously the scriptures are not the same women should just you know spit in their husbands I all the time for no good reason but the point is these were real marriages and if there's not given tape
what science has shown Harvard did this massive study of marriage isn't working don't work what they found is in a relationship where both the man and the woman are in charge and their own domain the marriage works and the man wants to be in charge everywhere it doesn't work and it's stupid and I was very fortunate because I grew up in a community where there's no divorce I mean I can't I can't remember one divorce in our very large neighborhood if any of my friends and my father business my mother didn't mess with his business but it home I mean you know he wouldn't even dream of getting involved like when I father came home if I even wanted to complain he was about anything they talked to your mother and he knew that
 don't even think of it and so those are marriages at work but there's mutual respect and the woman
domain the man is his domain and they cooperate together as a team that's what actually works and that was baited culture that's the real Vedic culture
