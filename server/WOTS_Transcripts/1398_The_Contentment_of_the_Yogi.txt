I know somehow given to some God the Sun God yeah cuz the Sun God is related to Radha Rani could send up and it fell off and then I think your moon I gave it to her father so you Dave right yes I think that's it then the Sun God gave it to such a such a tragic gave it to Krishna Krishna give it back to such a dick
 and then it was stolen and started it was killed yeah and then they were blaming the Krishna killed such a Jed and the Christian and kill such as you don't know they claimed that there was there was talk about it through this innocent had to go prove that he was innocent yeah then he sought out
 king of the Bears jumbo Bond number one

 okay so what are we doing about the what's our nugget today
 what is a good now that you sent it to me last night so anyway that podcast was very very cool and I like to support those guys who support the podcast that has yours come out yet or is it yeah just came out it just came out where you want that too on that in the interview you did notice are you on that laundry well do I have of it okay to get you you know what you know what I thought of when I heard this I thought of you
 go to you yeah I'll tell you why she has to appreciate you from Benjamin Franklin
wise man although I did have some play some Disney he did he also had some women I think of you always go there again. I don't think that's fair for you to do that you don't know the actual can someone Google up and see if Benjamin Franklin was a womanizer I'm not saying that people who do simple things don't have other good qualities also why must you focus on the negative
 good plants to grow their good workers were quoting him so users of years later we don't even know if it's how true it is or what the circumstances were like maybe they just maybe his wife is Jack Shaylee hard to fix the France and it's on the other side of the world you got to ride a boat for months to get there and I don't know whatever it was I like his statement here and
 contentment makes poor man rich
 and
makes rich men or maybe he should have been more content with his wife yeah maybe he was writing about himself a lot of times we come up with these he could have been he was married to read it again contentment makes a poor man written if you don't have anything nothing but it's not like they're like this one it's our desires drive us insane. That's a really important phrase and I think that's going to come up later and today said that our desires drive us
 a trivia game
 in the membrane searching through the whole point of getting rich is so that you can
 become content
you can actually become content
 without being rich and then you actually have the satisfaction the contentment that you're looking for and and as long as you have greed
 as long as you think you need more you'll never be content and you'll always be disturbed
 you know the story about chinaca I think it was about he was sitting by in the Sun and Alexander's Army
 okay I'm going to call him the great cuz he invaded India who is sitting there if it wasn't trying to get with some Sage classic Indian wise Indian saves sitting in the sun with his shirt off sitting in meditation and looking at the ocean and Alexander came this whole army with all these these men
I think they have some respect for them as well they said so what are you doing here he goes the sage said to Alexander what are you doing conquered Persia he said well what are you going to do next week as well and I'm going to conquer the rest of Northern India that's what I'm coming down to conquer Northern India you guys going to be conquered them we're ready to go then I'll make my way down to Eastern India or Southern India and he's like and then what are you going to do because we're going to work my bat way back up here and then I'll head back to Greece
 and he said and then what are you going to do and then what are you going to end then what is a great question and then what it's a great question
 he goes well then I'll just relax and shanica said well that's a real roundabout way to relaxing why don't you just sit with me right now we can relax right now. Relaxing right now why do we do so many difficult
so we can relax
 right where is my district McClintock ashore says when is enough enough enough enough like what how much what do you need to finally say okay now work is over and I think people get addicted to work
 and they big they become
 spiritual life almost becomes a little too enigmatic and mysterious and it like you know what I know work I'm just going to do that I don't know and I don't know God
 and so I'm just going to keep that at a distance so I think there is an importance to working to being responsible to being dharmic then there has to be a time and I'm re-evaluating my own life as well as when do I just start going on pilgrimage exclusively for me not for bringing people on pilgrimage when do I start realizing like I just want to stay and bring the oven and immerse
myself when do I say you know what today is hearing enchanting day today you know you're saying you want to serve others less it is you too so much nicer verse for people on this pilgrimage has a lot of nice service there has to be time where you going to take care of yourself although I will say I think my Consciousness is better when I'm serving other people then rather than sitting alone but what I feel like is I do need some more like quality time of myself and not just in India because you don't have to Krishna is not India's God God is God for everybody and every culture and therefore you can have God right in your living room if you know how to access God and it starts with your desire to access got so why not just have a day a week with this is God's day I'm just going to be with God today and then because we start off in our our sadhna
 and this is one thing I spoke about I think on the podcast yesterday
another podcast I did yesterday was like how do you add someone would say my life is so chaotic and I raised $5 and I raised a bunch of children how do I get God in my life and I'm saying what you got to call God in your life you got to call guy in your life and we do it in this tradition by adding a little God in the morning and if that works out well you expanded a little bit more and he had a little God in the evening you make a sandwich out of it we're all caught up in our cash and all our business
 but we had a little time before the busyness and to wind us down and then asked his start to grow up and in life is often times can get a little more
 there's a little bit more of a relief then we start to pad the beginning in the end of the day and I'm I'm seeing this a lot with a lot of the kids kids who are now men in their 50s who grew up with me getting into bhakti they were from the hardcore scene and I see that they're very serious about the spiritual life their kids are now growing up
and they're getting their padding more the evening in the morning time to their life and until then you're just really want your Consciousness to be God conscious so I'm sorry to analyze my life I'm getting older my kids are sort of going up and doing their own thing is precious time is precious and you don't you don't have any problems or should I do if you have millions of problems until you get a big health issue and when you have got a big help on issue then you got one problem you know how I'm going to deal with this health issue and this is how the devotees say you know the real problems of Life birth that disease in old age you know we don't think of birth is a problem and we sometimes we don't think death is a problem but we're not going to be there but you think of disease and old age and part of old age has I can't do what I used to do anymore so these are really big issues that I think was it that illustrates is that we think things are so
and we can't let go of them there's no way I would be doing more spiritual right now but I can't because there's he's really important things that I cannot go but then once you become sick you have to let go of those things you do divorce to let go it and you see we actually could have all along you don't you ever hear me tell that story about Kyle Ash
 this person named Kyle Ash I never once brought my wife and I went to India one year we arrived on Christmas on New Year's Eve
 and then we would kind of like straighten tomorrow just class and he was given in the radical be not Temple you know packed out everybody there on New Year's Eve night and he gives this talk on time. Time you know and
 it was really fantastic talk put it in a minute he told the story of this person and Kyle Ash like this man who had this family and Narda comes to him I think he was a disciple Narda
I said you know it's time you know you really need to be going to dedicate more of your time to the practice about you getting deeper in his first wife is NADA used it so true but right now you know I'm just I'm just starting my business and starting my home and it and let you know but as soon as I get that Indian place then I'll be ready to dedicate more time to my spiritual life and so Naruto comes back after you know after sometime said okay you got your home you have your business setup yeah but now I have kids to take care of you know and it is really you know it's good to inquire so you don't require so much of my time with my kids are grown up you come back and we'll talk about spiritual life and then so he comes right when the kids are grown up is like not now are you ready to dedicate your time he says you have but now I have grandkids are going to take a shower and then and then what happens is he
 he takes his a dies before you ever dedicated any time to spiritual life
and he takes birth is a snake and I think he may even take chicken breasts as a dog first and then takes birth is a snake or something like that and then I lost you know cuz he was taking too long and I me and my me and my son were watching rubber snake prank videos yesterday and you lost me there I just went right to the road up to the snake and the snake is like an end and he says okay are you ready now and he says well I can't because they're still my family and I got to look after them and then the article he goes to the family
 it says there's a snake in your yard you know Human family
Jason the snake is think about it you know it just to show that it's you know it's like we're moving through different bodies and different lives and we're always thinking I don't have time to something more important but there's nothing more important you know we got we got to become content with what we have so that we make time and space space in our calendar space in our minds to be able to invest that in bhakti you know that Cadet therefore that contentment is so important we read that letter from pro-pot the other day that that he wrote what he said vaishnava means one
 who is able to sit down anywhere under any conditions and be happy we need to do Contour like that you know how nice I could read a little from Edwin Brian cell yoga sutras I'm excited
I don't know who's doing the interview you or me I think you're doing that one
 okay but here's a hit you know santosha or contentment is one of the Annie Emma's right one of these ethical you know consider our piano practical considerations it was life and so it speaks about the santosha and then he Edwin Bryant drawers from the different commentators ever share their thoughts on classical commentators are so he says he writes contentment santosha is the second neama it manifest as disinterest and accumulating more than once an immediate needs of life
 okay disinterest in accumulating more than I need my chest Petit Mishra points out that the desire to appropriate the possessions of others has in actuality already been given up
in the youngest age you tell there as the Gita informs us
 desire is the Real Enemy of the embodied Soul since it is never satisfied and burns like fire meaning the more that you feed it it doesn't become satisfied it burns still more such a trick he says true happiness comes from contentment with whatever one has not with thinking that one will be happy when one gets all they desire even if there's some lack says shankara so strong car charger speaking out black
 one thinks it is enough that's where we you know that Siri is not quite enough it's enough you know what you have a new car you and Mara are incredibly content I will say just observing you both I'm going to put that out there 2 hours
out of the three I'm the least content and I grew up in a family where my parents were so ridiculously content where they can spend a farthing they don't have that much money they didn't slip that are miserly I don't know what you called me earlier Thrifty they save their money they say he didn't spend their brothers that their needs are simple they didn't feel that their needs were bought a new clothing scent was from Salvation Army when we were kids it was the common thing it was very, it's like everyone that did it that your pants had holes in the yard patch him up my oh yeah we passed your clothes that was like every Cadet at the knees like to have skin that had the built-in patches on them however that back to Sears and games but I was like I went to Salvation Army for clothing ever since I was a baby like I knew the
Tire staff for the Danbury Connecticut Salvation Army and then would have came cool when I was a punk rocker and 8th grade to go to Salvation Army by some crazy outfits everybody's Salvation Army be like hey Ray what's going on and all my friends were like how do you know all these people at Salvation Army Family friends that was stuff we didn't get new stuff
 write the shark car says this she said even if it's not quite enough you still do you train your mind to just respond it is enough or as Hari Haron under puts it how do you say that's a great name I've been dating one of my daddy's name is Cuddy car
 where is Hardy around underfoot set to avoid injury of this is so important in this actually I think hariharananda got this from Barbara Town cuz it's a verse that we're going to be today as hard hard this is a lesson for life right here
okay I'm all yours as Hari Haron under puts it to avoid injury from Thorns one only has to wear one pair of shoes one doesn't need to cover the entire Earth with leather
 okay that again say it again
 in order to avoid injury from Thorns one only has to wear one pair of shoes Okay one. Does it need to cover the entire Earth with leather
 so it says it makes it sound like they wore leather shoes back then adjust myself
 rather than adjust the entire world let me learn to be content that's one to judge but that's like putting on the shoes right then I don't have to adjust everything else in the world if I make that one address of nice in myself that I I learn to to be content then I don't have to dress up but if I never learned to be content
I will constantly be adjusting things the world it'll take all my time it'll take all my energy and eat up all my mental bandwidth I will not have the ability to focus and absorb my mind spiritually
 I was hoping to be more content at this stage in my life last time I went to your house was very hot and you were sitting there that was the last time you came to my house I was just playing with my old apartment
 really okay whatever it was hot and really hot day and I was just like damn it's so hot in here is is he crazy why is he so crazy why isn't just get a little air conditioner here I was like I was like angry at you for not having a little hair conditioner model to not bad it's just like you had a virus it's yeah I do run hot that's for sure but I was still
angry at you for being content that's how discontent I am point this is important point to when we speak like this a lot of the Western Mines up there I think the Eastern mind although it may not be so prominent in the modern-day which is been so influenced by the west but these are mines kind of like yeah we've always had this tradition of these monks that taught these kind of values where's in the west we pushed other value so much of the Forefront
 that to hear talk of contentment almost sounds like laziness or you know this person is an industrious enough to not a go-getter there either wasting their life to your loser you're a loser there's no appreciation for Annunciation but I have another nugget hear from someone named Macintosh it doesn't I don't have anything but
somak and he said
 it is right to be content with what we have never with what we are and that's the fact that they do with the Western people that are so eager to go out and get more stuff they're content with what they are right that is a great with the right McIntosh their their content with what would poor level of spiritual at Evolution they've achieved whereas the the the the renounce person who do you know the yogi who's who's be content with the externals is very ambitious internally to always be improving themselves improving their inner world you know which is what's has far more challenging it's harder to ship that subtle stuff than it is to ship the gross stuff you know Rodger Tompkins who is a regular listening to us
he writes and he lives in a van in a very nice place in in in California and we can do that in California is from
 he says I want to move out of my van into an apartment so I have a bathroom and a kitchen should I try to just be content with it these things how do we decide what is enough I think that's reasonable classification is like over a kitchen you're adding complication to Van life something complicated to them
 but you need I suppose most people feel they like I live in New York one of the things I like about living in New York you have a bathroom while there's that but I don't need a car
 what you get that car that's I complicated yeah Insurance parking maintenance repair
 yeah Celine has got to do her inspections today is it complicated
complicated
 yep it's a surprise visit apartments in apartments not well he doesn't live in New York City so therefore so he's going to need a vehicle anyway really why we don't have an answer for you cuz she was trying to push you into moving to Manhattan which that'll make your life and anyway try to push any movement at anyway which we have no answer for you but I appreciate your trust like yeah with the other Rancho Bernardo to Mom dating service with him the other side of the street my bag but I'm witches are very means of Conquest when should I be respectful of Basil seeds to the Supreme Lord Narayan unto not around Richie the Super Bowl she would being a good mother starts walking the goddess of learning

 even if a man is poor you should not Endeavor to improve his economic condition
 just to maintain his body and soul together or to become a famous religionists
just as a great python although lying in one place not endeavoring for its livelihood gets the food it needs to maintain Body and Soul one who is desireless also obtained his livelihood without endeavor
 without a doubt the back of the Python right
 it's going to be a little more content and create some space some bandwidth for spiritual life
 you know when we lived in ashrams you and I were very mission-driven it's not like we were just hanging out in the ashram we had a mission that we had schedules we had day planners you know just kicking back with a with a piece of lawn grass in our mouths that was the day when every moment was accounted for but there were people there were these random people that were just like a living from taking it weigh
about loafing but they were just like kicking it back. And I always thought of myself as like
 we could just do this to Rocco he could these guys are doing out there just a living here you know
 but your mind needs the engagement right you know I think it's your mind needs to be engaged
 we were talking yesterday about who won who's found satisfaction in the self for them there's no duty but until we got there we better keep that much
 look at an ashram was fun wasn't it so much fun and crazy and fun people that you meet one who is content and satisfied and who links is activities with the Supreme personality of godhead residing and everyone's heart enjoys transmetal happiness without endeavoring there's a livelihood where is such happiness for materialistic
who is impelled by lust and greed are for Wanderers in all directions with a desire to accumulate wealth you don't appreciate it lately question but a lot of like seeing your devotees that I know we're just so you know zipped up the bodis where I live in Columbia County they're getting rid of their smartphones and going back to flip phones since they realize they realize like the Simplicity look you want to call your kids if they're out and you want in an emergency but like we taking it to the next level now we're complicated we live with our face in the phone and the Saudis they don't have to worry about that they just had the simple basic things you know those that phone is an extension of our senses right it allows us to see further allows us to hear more functions is a mind which is considered the sixth sense you know it's a place to collect the information
lower the information draw the information back up process the information so it's just an extension of the senses and I think we get the idea if we're fortunate we get they do that it's driving us right the senses are driving us and so with the phone realize I've become a slave to this thing it's eating up my time it so you know my Energy seating at my bandwidth I got to eat seen up my money
 why not simplify yeah I put I put with my older kids I feel like I was a little bit more responsible because they went to the Waldorf School all we had didn't get phones till they were 16 with Tyrone he he got sort of like he sort of snuck under the radar because that the family structures were like broke apart and then do you want me to laugh and anyway but but now I've got them on this
reading program which you know when you when you have devices and this is not like okay when you're in school it's an adult as well so I can audiobooks people don't read as much anymore they want audiobooks I'm on the same but I got a gun to read for an hour day that's his new program he reads Mahabharat for an hour a day I'm listening that's great and how are they that's great for 10 year old to just sit and read the Mahabharata for an hour it's going to be the right then he has to do more done to Everyday practice word on getting them and we're talk about together every day how old is he now and he can play in a cure time he's good enough to to play well he's good enough to play with me I wouldn't say to like but I want my tablet to get him by next year to actually be part of you could follow up when he follows his brother he's really he's there now at what can you said 10:00 so you know he's going to be and I'll have that first whole life right now
having that skill will
 I saw many levels of support right it keeps them connected to the culture keep some connected to Krishna it it gives him opportunities to meet people and you know it gives him a chance to absorb his own mind and in the in the Cure time
 so good on so many levels it don't become expert you know it's great it's great habits Corona our little ten-year-old on the board and she said I can read Rami on for 2 hours you have to one-up him didn't you. And if no one stops me and there is no philosophy one rated movie in the Kamala subramanyam Mahabharat so that has a lot of these British words that you know he has to like what does
 LOL that's great thinking of a
coronarita reminder for 2 hours not getting tired of it yeah
 good stuff 10 years old what were the years old about to turn it on my face was blue to reruns play outside with my bike 24/7 okay text 16

 yes one who is content and satisfied and who links his activities while you read that one no I didn't get it here and there
 text 16 read it again when is content and satisfied in the links that tivities with the Supreme personality of godhead residing and everyone's heart enjoy Transit do happiness without endeavoring for his livelihood where is such happiness for materialistic man it was impelled by lust and greed and who therefore Wanderer
in all directions with a desire to accumulate wealth
 where is such happiness from materialistic man who was impaled by lust and greed and who therefore wanders in all directions with a desire to accumulate wealth lost
 and I like the beginning one who is content and satisfied Andrew links here's the clue right and who links their activities with the Supreme personality of God residing and everyone's heart there's a key you know you're going to find contentment there when you have God in your heart you're never alone right you're satisfied to Simply
 you know that you can open up that conversation you can begin to beat feel that a increase your awareness just threw your intention to do it get started at it and write think of God in your heart talked about in your heart to be so much easier to be content simply to be so much easier to two
respect every living being that's that's a focus for the yogi okay text 70 this is the one where I think
 Hari Haron under was John distinct form for person with suitable shoes on his feet there's no danger even when he walks on Pebbles and Thorns for him everything is auspicious similarly for one who is always self-satisfied there is no distress indeed he feels happiness everywhere so the adjustment of cultivating being self-satisfied simply satisfied satisfied internally rather than externally is synonymous oronoque being compared here to putting on a pair of shoes you make that one adjustment
 and now you ready for anything where is if you're Barefoot you're always worried about walking over here can I walk over there we need to pay that better we need to get this done at not too fond of her shoes 111 internal
what's self adjustment and are you ready for the world you know I think we've also got to that point I don't want to get into through political stuff. But I do know that we just don't have wisdom you know so even the good intentions they could they start to go into crazy places so now we're so concerned with people's feelings that we want to adjust the entire world do it just to everyone's feelings if good luck with that tell people how to deal with her feelings but how about I take know how about the third the second pillar or the third pillar of bhakti I take no offense people not to be so easily offended you'll be much more content. That we should because I mean we're also we should have found other so that should be taught to and that should be a size but trying to adjust the side like every little tiny aspect of society so crazy we need to
teach each other we need to train our children need to train ourselves and how not to be what is it immobilized you know by any little thing that we here or you know in the world that's named in itself is triggering me and I'm sorry you're going to have to I'm out of here right now feel safe I don't feel safe that's too much your words are violence cuz tuba I'm sorry for saying that which is not violence it's the response to your violence
 all right put on listen here I have something very deep to say but now I forgot it was probably offensive anyway or person okay
 fa-18 my dear King a self-satisfied person can be happy even
with only drinking water however
 one who is driven by the senses especially by the Tongue and the genitals
 must accept the position of a household dog to satisfy the senses I mean this all sounds great
 Santosh but the same time we're also like carved a certain way we're Roundup a certain way we're programmed to certain way so I know a lot of people who were just driven to do business
 and they're very good at it and I think under the orders net worth of Gloria but under that like the direction and inspiration by the teach a good teacher of them won't say give up your business will say try to do what you do but connected somehow to your spiritual life or where else would all happen is
that you got to figure out what that balance is for you I know that I wouldn't have lasted long in an ashram if I wasn't doing what I was doing with my music I was getting was being creative I was traveling I was I was teaching and I was happily engaged in a work that supported me as a devotee so we can just walk away from how our programs we have to do what we do and in a very positive Ennis in a spiritual way though instead of just doing it for just a cumulation of stuff if you're driven to cumulate stuff it's not like it's evil it just got to be tempered and to just say I'm just going to be Santos and give it all up that's not that's almost like they're not going to work but let's not create a false economy here even as you're even if you're engaged in the business world you still have to cultivate
 this has been. Okay well it sounds like it when you said right there was
almost
 have to connect it to your spiritual life okay but can never get a life is inherently as an Essence an element of contentment because that's bugging to get to where you are joining us being told by Krishna you have to fight this battle or I need to engage your skills in your nature in a very worldly realm. Like maybe the most worldly right so he says that any says it's because it's your ID card cuz it's your qualification because you haven't called have a cultivated deep satisfaction in her satisfaction then you need to engage yourself in this type of karma in this type of work but then he says but you're not entitled to the fruits of action, Nevada car is Tama Paula Chu podiatrist, Kaanapali hate to bore
 but a son goes to a car menu you have to work because of your nature but you're not entitled to the fruits of action that
Santosh right never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of reactivity and also never be tested not doing your duty be satisfied and engaged that nature but Santosh is always is always stressed
 but you know what I was thinking if we look at this verse
 it's saying the tongue the genitals right it's just like it's getting graphic but it popped into these virtual bodies
 and they have the senses that you know we're given that we're giving this equipment the senses so that we can pursue happiness through sense enjoyment separately from Krishna that's kind of what the realm is kind of design for it we enter into the body here's your tongue here's your generals go enjoy it now right but quickly if we're inside for we see these senses overwhelm us
and we become driven by them we're not we're not just like
 we're not just like at our own will engaging them for our pleasure we become driven by them and fall into Loops of karma action and reaction and we suffer because of that nice now they're dragging us here and dragging us there so he says you know even drinking water however one who is driven by the census
 especially the tongue and genitals
 must accept the position of the household dog degraded yourself
 not trying to criticize any household dogs interesting to know they all had household dogs they even had household hot all right we have time for one more I think
your king a self-satisfied person
 because of greed for the sake of the senses the spiritual strength the education austerity and reputation of a devotee of brahmana was not self-satisfied dwindle and his knowledge gradually vanishes for the sake of the senses straight the education the austerity and the reputation of a devotee who's Not So Satisfied Windows and is now it's gradually vanishes so important for people within the realm of a better way ministry right like where you're a person that people come to for inspiration and guidance
 in spiritual life priest or Rabbi or some kind of Brahmin or llama of some sort, that you need to keep you reflect on this right let's see where he goes again.
if if you if you become driven by your senses if you lose touch you know once it's important we we talked to some comfy weeks back about that book by Tolstoy that dumb father sergius I know he became very pronounced and even mystical but then you get a reputation you know and then that reputation through that reputation opulence is, it may come in the form of well to make come in the form of Fame and you you learn to find your satisfaction there rather than be satisfied without Pat oh I don't get my set it I have some Torres I have containment I'm not looking for feign to to find my happiness I'm not looking for wealth that may come through my Ministry or whatever I am detached from those things if you're not attached from those things
 you're going to lose it all what you what you gained through your austerity and through your through you know your
how do you send through your practices the realization that you've gained the knowledge that you've gained the reputation your spiritual reputation of in people's trust in you as a spiritual leader if you haven't become if you lose touch with being content simply you're going to lose that you know you going to lose it all it's all just going to seep out the the cracks and then then if then you have two choices and it because it happened slowly you don't even know when you have to make that choice you know but right you either have the choice of going back and cultivating that Santosh again to practicing austerity and letting go of things and simplify your life or baking it right now. Now you like an empty shell where you're like presenting yourself as if I got deep spiritual realization and so on and you really don't anymore and now you're living in a world of hypocrisy
