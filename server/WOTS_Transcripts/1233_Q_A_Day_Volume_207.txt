 the the value that they're getting from it you know they're their eagerness for ever have like in person meetups like let's all meet together I think they

 Ryland and Cody right in the middle of this Ryan I don't know that much about you but he's a pleasant surprise you're a very pleasant surprise I didn't know you came onto the scene you're all Harry bowling immediately your dancing and kirtan spinning around wearing court has and you're like inspired I've had good teachers going to answer answer hiding in the in the others category
you live in Upstate New York just a few hours away from Super Soul and Ithaca nothing you got to come visit absolutely okay okay what's the name of the town in which she took our question yes I am yes I am
 I wish I can use just been listening to have you go into the podcast let's just start their mutual friend of ours Ava Sullivan wow wish I didn't recommend asked when I was going through the 12 steps every and I was ready for a higher power and ready to have a relationship with a higher power but I didn't know how to conceptualize that that's beautiful Rich Roll
one of the sweetest people you'll give me to know that a soldier troll some credibility some credibility that's great so my question relates to my career I've been working as a chef in the Foodservice industry for the past five to seven years and in America that involves a lot of meat and I have accumulated some bad karma as a result of processing meat making it very delicious and scrumptious for customers to turn into some money I've already transition to vegan and I'm here in Maharashtra to train as a yogi
 and to Trinity yoga teacher but in addition to making this transition in my personal life and in my professional life I would like some advice on how to deal with and how to think about the bad, that I've accumulated to my personal and professional
you know who this reminds me of
 the number one
 Chef in Columbia County
 yeah she struggle with it I'd love to hear her like a little Mara and say we need to hear about Mary's Carmen exactly what ya thank you Ryan Ryan because Mario is also
 it was it ya hurt it was your business you build your whole life about it what the hell they do for you cuz you're practicing Baki and still doing it how did you have that work with you for a long time especially since I had a lot of not a lot but I had employee so I felt responsible for her so I didn't feel like I was able to like shift my whole catering business immediately when I stopped eating meat because I knew that it was going to radically change the nature of my business in terms of scale of it
 and then I had a whole plan to open up a secondary vegetarian catering business but then
it happened but I struggled with this and I just feeling really guilty about it for a long time which is guilt isn't always like the most helpful feeling to get you through anything
 but I also find that like because of that I think it keeps me humble and that like I never get particularly like a people are struggling with giving up meat I didn't struggle with giving it up but I have so much blood on my hands from how much meat I've served you know what I mean that I feel like I'm no better than anybody who just like eating a piece of chicken every now and again or whatever so I think it also works till I keep me humble but as far as actual things
 you know feeding people pay these food I feel like has made a big shift in terms of like getting people to understand the plan B can be like really tasty and they don't need to have me so I almost feel like that's hopefully accruing a little bit balancing out some of the Bad Karma that I have and then that and then like bathing in Bully
holy places that are actually supposed to purify me and Kelsey got this one first you know when Lord ROM
 went to Lanka
 with his army of monkeys and bears to attack Lanka and go rescue lady Sita from Ravenna probably called all his ministers together
 and his Minister said you know what should we do they're like don't worry about ROM you'll Crush ROM who is Rami some Mortal you're so powerful you all the demigods are afraid of you
 Rob and I had one very Pious brother called
 division division was actually at the body but he just stayed around his family and did his works are like Mara like she's a devotee but she's like.
her work and his work was he was the brother of the king and then finally he just gave some good advice as a minister said you know
 Ravenna you stole his wife just give his wife back and ROM is very kind he'll forgive you it's like you did something wrong just stop right there and give him his back give her back you don't need another you have a harem of Queens
 and Robin was so infuriated he just said if you weren't my brother I would kill you get out of here you are faithless through Medicaid and wish her happy like now I have an out both of you got an out also at a certain point Krishna will arrange for you to get out of that very difficult predicament and you only did and this is in reference to your question he went to wrong any walk there
like a prince and all the other monkeys were thinking all this is one of Robin his brothers let's kill him immediately and Hanuman and saw this man is different something is different about this person and sure enough when he saw Lord ROM he bowed down he took off his crown be bad down to Lord around that often times in the material world if you bow down to someone to step on your
 the Rams not like that Ram lifted him up and braced him
 and he said you know my Lord had made some horrible choices BB Sunset but from now on I am yours
 we've all made horrible choices
 we go out pretty safe to say we've made at least one or two horrible choices in our life but when you embraced when you approach wrong he Embraces you and your past is forgotten in reims eyes
you don't have to dig up that past it's gone you just move forward on your bhakti path
 if you have some attachment to it that's another thing you might have to work on those attachments but just move forward in your we're practicing controlling our tongues you're attached to meeting some people are practice not being attached to it you know I don't think you're attached to it you went vegan but as you step forward in your boxy all's forgiven about the past and also that they described like a your car was like a fan and you surrendered a Christian or The God it's like unplugging that fan you still get some karma from the past but it's burning off very very quickly
 you're doing everything right on that two behind it it don't see the momentum's over now
 and now Krishna uses that Karma with a tan in a more of a magical way than some motive 80 gunas way right now Chris is using that Karma
for some purification
 Christian is now taking control of your karma your whole astrological chart means nothing now it's now Christian control of your every little detail krisch's out the driver of your vehicle and everything is a blessing how evil you do to end it for both of you guys Krishna gave you an out but I think you might have held you there for a while or you held yourself there for a while because you weren't ready for the app out yet and it gives a certain point it was a blessing you became very very obvious it's over so good for both of you guys found a girl's hair
 okay Bombay cost contain yourself where I live now they're regulars on our show they were here I was
I thought you were here and I wasn't going to tell you where my 40K next question LOL. Can I speak to that one so you still like give me some stroke of but I loved her so I'll try not to touch where you too I think everything that you said was really valuable
 Bella Swan
 I was thinking that
 within all the different spiritual Traditions are all the different religions there's kind of like a progression or an evolution of how one approaches it and the the Inn
 in Sanskrit and from The Vedic tradition these these levels that you climb the called karma Janna Bucky so, is where there's a lot of concern about the laws of karma a lot of concern
about Bad Karma particular how to how to how to accumulate Good Karma how to Cuban how to accumulate Pleasant results to ones activities how to avoid the Bad Karma how to counteract the bad, that I've committed in the past so I don't have to suffer really this karma is a we could call it the cosmic sensitivity training right it's it's meant to train us I'm not sure if I sent it to sensitivity training it has a purpose and that purpose is that against us going moving
 towards thinking and behaving in a way that is harmonious with our true nature as compassionate kind generous loving Souls
which is really our nature do its job is to help correct us when we're straying from that help reward us when we're moving in that direction
 that's how we understand how the law of karma works now all the different Traditions they may not go into depth about something like a lot of, but they all have a conception of sin or bad behavior and a conception of reactions for that negative reactions for that and so on that lower I don't I don't want to speak down to it but in one sense it's the lower rung of evolution is a lot of concern about that in judeo Christian language of call that is like salvation right salvation I think literally like the def definition of salvation is has to do with the freedom from the reaction to what's 1st Lake Penance solecism what's Opanas for the purpose of retaining Salvage to ride like that let me see let me try to counteract for my sins I'll do this so that I'm not getting worse reaction sure
is that what can pet me where you can where you what's it called a firm confirmed isn't in confirmation if you go to the priest yet I've done this I've done something naughty things and then he says oh can you chant for our fathers 220l Mary's is that what it is but do you say that the same thing as like yes I mean cuz it's one thing if you're saying hail Mary because I want to develop deeper love for Mary and it's another thing for Spring Hill Mary because she don't want to have to suffer for the results of your previous activities so that conception I'm praying our father I'm praying you'll marry I'm praying it so that I won't have to suffer the results of my past sins that's the karmic mentally that's the lower rung of the spiritual realization
 then there's something called Kiana which we don't need to get in trade on an assembly called bhakti and body that's not the concern but I'm shedding Hail Mary or raining Hail Mary not be
I am trying to counteract my past I'm praying he'll marry because I want my goal
 my focused goal is to develop love for Jesus and love for Mary and therefore I'm I'm I'm absorbing my Consciousness in Sentiments of Love through that prayer so so when somebody Hoagies
 they their their whole thing is I have face-to-face that if I give myself to Krishna if I give if I offer Christian my body if I offer Christian my words if I offer call tanino Christian my mind my heart
 I just that I'm in his hands and then then I know I'm not worried about manipulating the the automatic automated laws of this universe Cristobal I'm his he's he's the one
Deb that's in charge of these laws you know they're all his energies let me just give myself to him and if I meant to suffer in this Krishna that's it's Christmas hand in that for my own good right I'll bring it on then all I want is is to develop that that Prima I want us to go out that pure love so that there for the the the back to Yogi's they're not did theirs is Vedic rituals to call Price Chitto right that our gear designed to help counteract your Bad Karma and you know The Vedic literature which deals lot on that karmic level that there are the four Vedas they prescribed things at the store you get these dharmashastras like pizza and stuff in this pic a lot about they speak to that but when you get to the refined
 well developed mature Literature Like a human bog with time
they don't have any interest in that as a matter fact they speak directly to it and the point is made as what's the point to to counteract in your past that activities when you just try to become free from the reaction but unless you deal with the actual desire in your heart for those things you just commit the same things again and it's like an elephant jumping in the water going to come and clean and jumping on a rolling on the ground and getting dirty again you're just stuck in cycle you're not going anywhere you just kind of obsessed with the the automated laws that God created in this world has turned to God you do with a with a pure heart with a motive
 so it's all about you always just like yours if I meant to suffer I'm sorry but then this is the point once you do that that's what the law of Carmen all the bad karma is meant to help you understand anyway so it's kind of like
the beginning of your reformation and two cents right like it's like you you're already moving in the right direction, you don't have to come and shovel a person in a direction that they're already moving so that bad, is really not so necessary for you cuz it's for your own good but it's already moving that direction don't really is it's a necessary now and so therefore would rug and I said was really profound that that dumb if it's profound because what I'm suffering now for the bucks you owe me is like maybe it's a direct result of increased activity of mine may be so direct result of a previous activity mine but the the the potency of it has been greatly reduced like like the The Fog has been pulled out of the fan so when it hits me
 it's not hitting me so hard or maybe it has nothing to do with my past a bit
maybe she's Christmas way of helping me become the person I need to become whatever it is I accepted his krishna's grace what whatever it is that is Christian. I'm not concerned about manipulating it I'm not concerned about counteracting it I just accepted and I just focus all my attention my mind on Cermak and so therefore you get quoted there's a lot of different clothes you can find that speaks about this when you're on that hire round of the the body shots Teresa. Either one of them we can read and the nectar devotion which is a book you know that's it's a it's a it's a very focused book on on explaining the speciality of bhakti yoga and one thing that's mention there's a when you are into your tongue
 singing the names of Krishna dancing with ecstasy when you're actually not not going to some priests and pay him some donation to do
ritual did you know reverse something don't know you're just like I love you and I want to sing and dance and chant your names and when you clap your hands and that cure time they say sike
 you can hear all the birds they don't take off so when you clap when you clap your hands in the kids I have all of that bad, that you had just like birds flying out as you good news isn't it a great answer and it reminded me of we had a next-level to your time last night it was one of these kirtan I started you don't like a beer and I am okay with that you're better I had my good thing going and all that stuff but they cash or Rico is there for the money for his house and he is like
cardo of course he's powerful beautiful great dancer please the wompers like you know Mozart plays the harpsichord and anyway it was exactly like that exactly and he's incredibly wild the whole thing at Rob's comes down lands goodnight everybody who walks in the door or not. Swamy in the whole thing starts from the beginning again right when you thought tonight was over we went a whole hour and a half and it says like the clock stopped we could have been there for hours last night we were leaving our bodies you're floating on air it was unbelievable I think I just posted something on my
Instagram I am at one point with John if he was saying I took because of your pee by the picture this is up on a hill
 like a peek and it's it's an outdoor Temple so it's like a it's a courtyard marble Courtyard kind of sunken Courtyard up on this hill
 and you know we're under the stars you know in this in this tasteful kind of car does daddy trying to curse and Stone Outdoor small Temple and the kitchen was going on at Genevieve in Los Angeles voices on Earth and all the people are dancing to that and I took a few steps back towards the steps that so I was just observing from a distance for a moment
 and when I saw that everyone is Dancing with their arms in the air at night time under this and I thought this is like this is very clearly you know it was this remind me of the stories may be a lot of our listeners don't nobody else but you
play some gun yeah where you would go with this intimate disciples and their original the origin of the sun kirtan movement doing the security lb at night and everybody to just absorb its arms in the air and I saw ginanni boss purple with this when the purest Saints the other that we know who's lived in my poor for so many years ago but I should tell you that and then he came up the stairs and he and he just got right there and finish and I can't see what's going on in his mind but it just seemed to me like he must know that it was beautiful. It was one of these really
 I'm one of those guys you're like okay I was break your tongue let's see one of those and it literally felt like the clock stopped then we could have sat there all night and even when my said you know goodnight it didn't it didn't and we want everyone says waiting but like is it going to go on
okay but does any of Sri was excellent if you're here in town Academy your shoes like a rockstar and and it was quite wonderful
 the country would you repeat that I actually have the day off today but there's always a party that's really sweet okay next question is the question in the Linda Linda come on down whenever favorite Zoomers from Tampa Florida
 st. Pete can I say Tampa cross the river cross the bay
 across the bed
find all there is a regular worker a regular worker regular regular my story is I heard rakkanoth on Rich roll back in 2021
 and I was captivated and so I turned into the podcast and then I thought I joined the zoom and then the next year I went to about three different Retreats and it just keep coming back my body just keeps getting deeper and deeper so I'm really grateful thank you till you're both his drawers I can tell you I did not know I was very intentional not go through things I shouldn't go through
 is Library very is library's very very I was very envious of it though I went home and
immediately wanted to make my home or septic without spiritual and be it's good thing that's good so Linda Linda Linda hakama surgery today so my question is this one of the six pillars of bhakti is to take no offense a good Peddler but in the back of a time it mentions in several places that one of the worst things you can do is a friend of the agency that one of the key principles as not to offend a devotee so it seems contradictory and I'm hoping you can provide some clarity
 don't write the script last question we don't want to send it but he's not devotees I don't know if Linda wants to sit down. We don't want to spend about 80 but devotees don't take offense even if someone's to say even if it was someone was to be a pensive my work
is I don't take offense I have to understand how this isn't even happening to me it's happening for me somehow this is happening for my evolution
 and you're like well what's the big deal then I'll offend everybody that they're not going to take offense anyway they don't take offense Christian it's takes offense because they become very dear to Christian just like if you can say whatever you want to me but if you mess around with my kids I lose my mind you know what I mean so just like a parent so affectionate towards a child if someone gives your child you know something is Earth kind to your child it warms your heart but it seems cruel to your child you get become like a mother bear you no need to start to attack so in the same way Krishna loves everyone what does speak of the people were practicing bhakti try to get on a regular basis trying to get closer to Krishna
 so the devotees naturally don't take offense they internalizing
they understand hey I've got some bad karma I probably deserve worse how can I see this for my purification if I do take offense I should understand I'm off my spiritual tracks the train is off the tracks we practice on the regular basis immediately and completely
 but Krishna will take offense so we have to go to that devotee that we're harboring resentment against or that we defended and we apologize then answer questions
 Steuben County weather in in Boston in Boston Boston please it made me think of one past him in the box and we're not there yet and I can tell Maurice I'm very smart this one great ruler Warrior King Cole it's a reason I believe is the example of them up in the bed and I said not giving one's very
he gives and everything so he'll although he was this important political figure with you know so much worldly responsibility she and everything that we did all the senses and of his body all this is mine was just like kind of fully absorbed in and making everything and offering to God so he was very dear to me. And then there's this one very powerful Mystic Yogi but he's also known as Chief is also known as El serrucho fish which means Mara
 easily angered and easily pleased so and maybe with a particular focus and easily angry and so how is it that I'm he just he just follows disciples he had like hundreds of disciples with him there and it show up in the house and
okay and are you know it's it's it's nature with a sword to come to your house you want to feed them it was like okay we're going to take bath first and then we're going to come and eat so so he's so he could this wonderful I have this opportunity to serve this is this is Yogi in in all of his father's and
 and then. They all went to go bathe and he was going to prepare everything but in that time while they were bathing he had been following a strict fast and to do these things precisely Indian you faster so not time then you break the fast at a certain time and she realized it would be wrong for me to eat before my guests return I should be eating before I serve my guests and not only that he's like your ass money is going to get really mad if he sees me eating before the guests eat I mean that I'm not sure that he was worried about that in particular or probably worried I think he was feeling I don't want to do I don't want to make that
are you anything out of inappropriate inappropriate and but at the same time as is like but my fast is an offering to God and I want to offer than just the right way so then he consulted with his adviser so you know that's a damn if you're going to say there's a plan you drink a little water is like breaking a fast and it's like separating the past perfect thank you and would have never thought of that in such so he drinks a little water now I know I'll be to Roscoe okay so well I'm just welcomed back and ready to serve you
 oh you got to drink the water now I already drink it I thought he saw him drinking the water but he doesn't need to see him he's got that yourself before you take care of your guests you sit there and indulge yourself
Fancy please forgive me but durvasa was so angry that accursed a fireball and so but rather than it hitting ambareesh rather he ended up being chased right by the Subaru Ascent chakra additional that what happened was he threw the Fireball. Fireball come out of each other but we're dishes of course swallows the other one cuz it starts chasing the Great Sage throughout the Universe now that he's not used to usually the sage is the one that's in full control. He's got his y'all get power and he's always kind of like nobody can mess with him something he has Lord vishnu's
 fiery chakra burning at his back and he's running as fast as you can try
find some relief and he has ability to go all the way up to my pumped it to the to the to the outer edges of the spiritual realm and there he finds swordfish do what he says please you know
 I'm sorry please remove this disk from you know how I need to be free from this and Vishnu says I can't. That's not how this works even if you have ended my devotee and so he's taken offense at that AC and there's only one cure you can apologize to me all day so I can make any difference to go back and apologize to him and then he says this famous verse in this kind of review of something I think this verse kind of gets to the heart of Rogan us to answer to your question
 I used to know this one
 it's a nice polite open audible read I am Maya
 merunyaa
John Oddity
 Angel Gabriel monographie de Pyaar de votie is this is Lord Business speaking and he speak into this Mystic Yogi that Mystic Yogi accrued hours to austerities through intense yoga practice but it doesn't touch that didn't touch business heart will touch the heart was the devotional of the lawn to reach so he says the pure devotees always within the core of my heart you don't always hear this kind of description about God we hear about how God is in the heart of the devotee we don't often hear about how the divaldi is in the heart of God it's not a one-way love thing or one way worship saying he's worse because devotee
 so he says the pure devotees always within the core of my heart and I am always in the heart of my peer devotee
 my devotees do not know anything else but me
 and I do not know anything else but that
 yeah so it's not so it's it's
the devotees like that they're not offended but it's it's it's hurt the heart of Krishna just like it that you gave a nice example of it doesn't matter how nice you are to a parent if you offend their child in some way
 it just counteracts everything that you might have done it when they're hard to get just overrides everything Linda Linda Linda question good question no more offenses Linda okay what's good
 Cody come on down coat is a regular Zuma she's from the deep south southern belle she's got a parasol you'll see in a moment that would be selected for at the southern belle
 okay
you're the southern belle till you get there how are you tell your story who are you where you from What's your deal and Cody I live in Charlottesville Virginia right now but was in New York for a long time New York City and that's how I stumbled into bhakti yoga Brooklyn yoga teacher training lots of be teacher and then stumbled into someone who went to frame out who highly recommended pilgrimage and I went blindly I had never even met you or anything and then in 26 boy were you in for a surprise. You are over and Evan
diamondback snake fourth trip to India with you so slightly addictive once you got a taste for holy places and people at devotional service it's like all you want to do is come back you think about it all year long I was going to say you were crewing all kinds of memories and experiences that are going to just inform the rest of your life you know stay with your decision I think is huge question was there a shifting point where you like you know what I'm opting in for this like what where was that on that first of what happened like was there a place only in time perhaps one of broken unsecured time perhaps your other philosophy teachers gosh I think I think actually being down at the Ganges mother ganga that first time really there was the big shift that happened there
Conga is very merciful and Powerful I'm humbled but yeah
 so my question is a pretty simple one but I'm a little embarrassed to ask it this late in the game but I'm going to ask it anyway what is the bocce viewpoint on doing chanting japa silently in your head is it considered not as effective or frowned upon is it not even considered Joppa at all if it isn't technically an eyeball sound vibration I can drop into meditation and better when it is silent but I want to be aware if there is a huge benefit to chancing allowed that I might be missing I can say what I've read and I can say what I experienced is well one question for you later I know what you read
I got all my sacred wisdom from Vader comic books Let's talk about the book, He's a book that is a conversation between SRI chaitanya with the yoga Dharma Avatar of Channing the whole in speaking with heart attack or who is the nominee of the great teacher of the chanting of the Apes and heard us talk or maybe a few words when he was a born that he was a Muslim that was you know for the timer born a Muslim family the time and loves me day tours in Muslim rule in India but he understand like oh I get it these people are reaching a particular religion there for their speaking of spiritual truths is Krishna is the Olive that's the same as
and of course he's names of Christian the very intimate but this is there's only one God and he understood like it makes no difference but this holy name is very very powerful and he fell in love with you all these basic teachings so he became the it was considered the master of chanting japa practically you just chatted he was like a yogi in this sense ability to stop and get a chance to meditation in his cave all day there's yeah exactly with a split with the serpent in the cave so I can get out of that cave cuz this is big poisonous serpent in there so I can eventually the serpent said okay I'll leave it for him in the serpent anyway many stories that was a good story prostitute was sent by the Muslim ruler cuz they didn't like the example that a Muslim has now become a Hindu is popular and this makes us look bad
humiliate him try to send the prostitute to seduce him and what happened with the prostitutes happens when you're around great Souls you become like that prostitute became a immigrated to prison and all the people in jail start chanting and it said no you have to stop chanting or will beat you in prison if he said you could chop my body up into millions of pieces and every little piece of still going to be chanting Christmas day is it just just when I am so anyway he's this great greatly honored in our traditions and I heard a stalker so this is a conversation with treat you Tanya who we accept as non different is he is Krishna
 Krishna asking questions too hard. Taco is getting the answers and in and it shoots attorney sings all your answers are so
Arctic survival he said you're telling me my answers are good but your is is you that speaking through me I have nothing to offer but it's only so it's a beautiful conversation where Christmas who are fighting his the volume by asking him the questions and so they are he speaks on his subject of chanting silently or changing out loud
 Jenny Wiley cycling audibly or loudly okay whatever helps you keep your mind focused and sometimes I like to chant and just sit almost like silent meditation but I'm inhaling the maha-mantra and exhaling the maha-mantra or sometimes didn't he like twice the maha-mantra exhaling twice them, but I find the techniques I find that generally slightly Audible
how sweet focus more I know I'm a little bit loud when I can walk around chatting with Mara she's very quiet when she chance she's just very quiet. But and I'm just a little ride like that and sometimes I wake up and so sometimes I do like that yourself but sometimes I just remember what it's saying it seemed that actually even if what you said is absolutely correct but that silent chanting is actually considered like a higher-level Channing not hire it's a higher-quality location to chant that way in other words that the audible sound is an aide to keep the Mind fixed so Channing silently is
 doing it without that day. It's kind of like there's no training wheels on in One sensors so so it's it's certainly valid and in real sure but we are encouraged to chant loud
so that the sound can help us keep the Mind focus and so you know a lot of times people ask what should I be thinking about what I chat and tell him and my ass like I always go back to it I heard from Shield Obagi that is like just try to hear the sound just try to hear the sound chat and try to hear the sound so I just like to chat aloud sometimes I do answer depending on circumstance but but I I would recommend if not always at least two regularly a chance of the sound allowed an end and then just try to hear the vibration and feel the vibration and bathe in the Bible immerse yourself in this in this sound
 otherwise it's the same vibration going through the mines but if you can get it going to the ears in the body and the mind and maybe an eight yeah I like that how do you do it now as that cup work
I mean it works but yeah I do I do feel like my mind has a tendency to like have it looping up front and then there's like a whole another conversation cuz I have that chance silently and end up chanting busy Mantra very easy to sort of like those I specially if you're Rising very early to chant to so far you've been here for two weeks you're going to be here for the wisdom training are you going to my poor too and see you know what what she called me so I'm trying to figure out which one to do and I was like Cody
