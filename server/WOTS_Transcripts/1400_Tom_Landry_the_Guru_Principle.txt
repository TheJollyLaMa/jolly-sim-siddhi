 you know we should do something special on Tuesday probably Pods cost
what was the Nugget who's this is from person I even know who he was Tom Landry he was the well-dressed coach of the Dallas Cowboys wear like athletic kind of cars you know that you are a suit and a hat ball fields but you know back then I had an uncle that was a professional football player who played for the New York Giants back when they would win before the Super Bowl score when they win the Championships yeah and I think
 Tom Landry
I think he was mad then the if it wasn't the coach head coach he was like a coach
 I think first he was under Vince Lombardi I believe and then he was with the New York Giants and I think my my uncle followed him to take out your scroll I don't have my squirrel with me telling a story is okay as long as it's related to the point with Tom Landry from the New York Giants 22 the Dallas Cowboys when they first
 when is money first started like there was a new team and he really had respect for Tom Landry these aren't back when the coach was like just kind of like them not just the head coach for like the moral authority of like the team you know yeah they were got the inspiration inspiration and it but they were they were really like them
like the date they had a dignity about them you know and end in this players are really respect the coaches and Tom Landry was like a great example of that from what I from everything I've ever heard about him
 here's a squirrel that I find interesting. Do you know what Super Bowl is this year and number of the Super Bowl
 do I do I'm going to give you a way that you will never forget okay
 the Super Bowl started on our birthday 66-58 do you know what Super Bowl is
 yes I would have seen how to say like if you were born 9 years ago Reagan what what year were you born
 66 and how old are you now 9 years ago how old would you be
 tarun just did this joke to me yesterday I did 9 years and I be 9 years old say it again
I guess that joke if you're born 9 years ago how old would it sound little like at the beginning part is just to kind of get you thrown off right I know he got he got me yesterday I was like that's so weird he does exact same joke okay let's get serious about life I have to say Tom Landry it says if we were in the locker room with him right now
 Sirius is someone who tells you what you don't want to hear who has you see what you don't want to see so you can be who you have always known you could be
 it's beautiful
 coaches someone who tells you what you don't want to hear maybe I'm your coach bear just kidding just need to talk about is my coach
go to somebody tells you what you don't want to hear who has you see what you don't want to see so you can be who you have always known you could be up this point I'm going to sell you my life coaching course for a mere
 $18,999 and tell me what you think about this quote that for real
 it's great it it's like we all suffer from a blind side a blind spot so to speak and even though in a we say or she Tanya says and we shouldn't criticize we invest in a person who has greater Vision than us not to critique us and to give us feedback is it to say Hey you know you played that move around you stepped wrong there we need people in our life that we can trust that we feel
this person doesn't have any motive they're not going to just cut me down for the Roni do they actually want to see me grow so when you have very loving people in your life that you can trust we should go to them and say what do you think about this here's what I'm thinking and we shouldn't invite that type of criticism I don't like they even called criticism but sometimes you can come off like that it's a it's instructive and we need that it is important to develop and she a good teacher won't make you so dependent on the teacher a good teacher will teach you how to think instead of what to think and so they'll help you develop your discernment and that's what that's what SRI Guru is Shri Guru will help you discern and learn how to think but we have to first admit we have some blind spots and we need and we invite that into our life because we want to grow
 you know I have a bondsman
I was thinking we're going to hear today about this principle the guru in one in the life of the
 practitioner and you know there's so many statements about the group is singing group hot for understanding the the truth about this principle of Guru you know that what is they say it's a very subtle topic there's a very practical end to it in and I think we can discuss that a bit right now you know if in any field if someone is more experienced than you is going to be helpful for you and if you have a trainer in a really good one year there's this hole would like to discuss the Practical and but there's also like a mystical is the right word that I'm looking for but let's say
 beyond the Practical and there's this Transcendent element in the group which
 is multifaceted but a lot of it has to do with the idea
 that you do an assessment
what about you say that this there's a very special idea that the god
 become submissive to the love of those that love him
 and so if the guru has love for God like anyone
 then God becomes subservient to them so if the group on one hand has influence over the heart of God
 and on the other hand within their own heart they have a genuine concern for your spiritual
 growth
 then God becomes directly involved in your own spiritual growth like I said very special type of Grace that's available through a person that has love of God you know to the Practical level
 let's talk about coaches you know like you did there's only you knows I guess it's a common film kind of
genre I heard something about you have like the sports films you know in this will be a coach and the team will be kind of down and have time or something like that in all these guys with all these big egos are all in that locker room and the other problem is you know that there are they all have these egos thinking they're so great but then when the real test came they weren't able to perform as a team because their egos are getting and where they may even be talented but they they weren't able to put their egos aside and work together and you have a coach now they're they're coming off that field and they're all have lost their faith that they can actually succeed
 and the coach can actually see what that what their potential is so you know but he may have to tell them a few things that they don't want to hear you know and and he's going to spell it out like this is this is why it's not working I can see what you can be and I can see why you're not achieving it
 and if you just hear
if you just set your ego aside and just hear me I can take you to the other side you know and then you know generally the story plays out that they manage to do that and they succeed and saw this in a sense this is also where the glue is there is there person like that coach would be the only one with the that still has the conviction that we can win you know they've all kind of lost it in their whole morale is shatter this agree with someone that has this Rock Solid conviction about the power of bhakti about the Powerball to yoga and how it works even when we're feeling like all I'll never make it I can never make it you know it's too hard is to know know know I know how it works you know and I have no doubts about it and if you just simply follow and it's and we're like those athletes who've lost their morale in life you know we go through life is so many struggles we struggle with her mind we struggle with her senses we struggle in our environments and within our relationships and we it's not at all
of course you know and I've been chatting these days these mantras for so long and I don't think it's working or not transforming and and the the coach you know the guru's someone that can say I don't know I know how the process works you know this is a few things you need to tighten up and you need to set aside some of these Petty things that are in your mind you know and it will work so you need some of that it's going to take you to that other side and also someone like the coaches the person that really has knowledge of the game you know they don't just have the talent at a player might have
 but they really understand how the game works and you know that really understands how the process of Body Works have the knowledge of it they have the realization of it far better than we we have ourselves and that becomes so important in their ability to instruct us and they have these deeper insights you know so you learn to follow that we were talking yesterday
the people that they're kind of grew figures but then they do you know because they begin to
 try to enjoy the results that come from that all of their spiritual Merit just kind of their character to Minish has Tom Landry was doing that you lose all respect for him. He's got like the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders all right she's mine and you don't disrespect you have to hold that position with Integrity a lot of those coaches are real serious Christians and I believe Thomas Tom Landry was you know and then their spiritual life played out in their new role as a coach
 but they say you know this verse of the day yesterday very put out back to you it's hard to tell girl to Straight Talk for those
white sauce is mahatma's who have this deep and place it face and Devotion to God and to Guru to both
 to them all the Imports of The Vedic literature It all becomes automatically revealed through that one step two step 1 Step like bye-bye face in a valid bona fide Guru
 it kind of is like doing everything that you get everything in one place
 very powerful principle let's take this to the body what time the same principle here with The Bob & Tom shows about gurus teachers Etc they got a lot of flak nowadays vehicle roof
 Duran in the musketeer on that I'm sure what time I'm leaving Sarah's about India some little jam with diarrhea before I started to shoot my bow my time which is every means of Conquest when should a freezer be
basil seeds to the Supreme Lord Narayan on too darn right we see the Super Bowl she would be able to mow on the sheriff SWAT to the goddess of learning and then she'll be asked today the author that's the prettiest, botheration the Chum Bucket bag of acute emotional okay back there Bubba knish takii by regular class in the Bog of time and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the heart will become eradicated loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transit of the songs we established as in a revocable fact since he's out there Lotus feet reading from the Shoot-Out by what time
 can a 7 chapter 15 test 23
Anarchist unwanted
 things in the heart desires drives do ya
 things that wreck you as a being cuz this text 23
 by discussing spiritual knowledge walking conquer lamentation and Illusion by serving a great devotee one can become prideless and by keeping silent one can avoid obstacles on the path of Mystic Yoga Yoga hasn't developed and simply by stopping sense gratification one can conquer and be nice
 probably gives a little he focuses on one in the counter you know this song by discussing spiritual knowledge we can conquer lamentation Andalusian
 any just cuz example you know that if one son is died one may certainly be
buy limitation in illusion one of the most painful things in her and I cry for the dead son for one may overcome limitation losing by considering the verses of the bug of agita you know what to talk about Theatre now through the songs that kind of reflection when you do reflect in life we need to hear and reflect discuss
 is there a frozen am I Frozen are you frozen
 I think we lost her I'll go and he's moving around so okay
 that would take us to do you end up reading test 24
 but good behavior and freedom from Envy
 once you counteract suffering due to other living entities
my meditation in trance once you cataracts sufferings you to Providence
 the practicing Hatha Yoga and so forth once you counteract separates do the body and mind similarly by developing the motive goodness especially in regard to eating once you conquer sleep tips Pro tips of how to live a live a better life be a better you text 25 one must conquer the modes of passion Tango by developing the mode of goodness then one must become detached from the motive goodness by promoting oneself to the platform of should your goodness all this could be automatically done if one
gauges in the service of the spiritual Master with faith and devotion in this way one can conquer the influence of the moon has for the modes of nature will so she know it's began by saying one must conquer the modes of passion and ignorance the lower modes by cultivating the mode of goodness suckle going on you know the higher mode
 and then but still we say that even the motor goodness is a trap
 yeah it's a golden handcuff from the mode of goodness and the results had it delivers right like a peaceful, content life you know but then one must become detached from those guns by promoting oneself to the platform if she would have said for one really needs to hear about the spiritual platform cultivate that and that can be done most effectively and most one
pointedly by being engaged in the service of someone who has mastered bhaktiyog you know a spiritual Master with faith and devotion I was reading this book called The samudra shastra yeah that's the palm reading and that indicate how many children you meant to have yeah what how many do you have on your hand
 children to have because it but then what went on to say but even that can be changed through Guru nishta to being fixed and services that that's it's just one very you know again for the Practical reasons as we were discussing you know someone who's got that complete conviction those deep inside stairs knowledge of how to follow the path of you just if you just follow them
old words you got all these mental ideas maybe this won't work maybe this is better idea maybe I should be doing this maybe I'm more like that and if you just follow what to speak of the special blessings that can come to serving someone that's very dear to Krishna same same with the astrological marriage compatibility if you feel like Wolverine are in the Bhagavad Gita and you can transcend any
 incompatibility of keep medicine center about
 the misunderstanding of what this relationship is for the misunderstanding the misapplication it's been so misapplied to put
because it's a lot of counterfeit out there doesn't mean that it doesn't really exist you and I have had the fortune Good Fortune
 to be able to in our own lives and in the lives of many round is see the principal work well yeah we have we've had a chance to see how it sometimes it falls apart but we've also had plenty plenty of experience of seeing how it works well some people at our candle makes total sense to Campbell's real scandals happen very powerful Dynamic scenery contest 26 the spiritual Master should be considered to be directly the Supreme Lord as a heavy statement cuz we always say they are not God right so here's a very tricky statement here
the special Master should be considered to be directly this should be more because he gives transitive will knowledge for enlightenment consequently for one who maintains the material conception that the spiritual Master is an ordinary human being everything is frustrated his Enlightenment and is Vedic studies and knowledge are all like a bathing of an elephant's that analogy if you're unfamiliar with elephants that analogy is an elephant will take a bath when do we take a bath or dirty and elephant will take a bath if he'll become quote clean but then he let me know we throw dirt back back on his body again it's just a ritual elephant still so that it's it's saying here that
 one who maintains the material conception that the spiritual Master ordinary everything is frustrated all of them all of their practices so we do accept that the Google is not God she or he is not God but the
they're giving you the instructions from God because it is baked in them of behavior and thoughts and the importance of ritual the sub substantial the substance behind ritual the meditational practice so we're giving them that Authority yes kind of like the idea of the power of the of God is working through the Brewers flowing through them sure and so just like consider like if you have a president of a country they empower the Ambassador the Ambassador goes to another country
 and the Ambassador is not the president but there's good as the president because they they've been empowered by that President they represent that President so when they're greeted the greeted with the same kind of
respect that. You're the president of that Country Now imagine if you want to have a good relationship with that president but you totally blow off that Ambassador X like it won't work it doesn't even even no matter how well you're doing what you do your connection is through that Ambassador and so simply that the is the guru's empowered by the representing it's not that in the nature of that one really has to understand because that group is their whole idea is I'm not special I'm not God I haven't created something new I'm just the representative like like the Ambassador knows I'm not the president I don't rule the country just the representative so they're thinking like that
 and those that are related to anything like the president is working right through the president's phone right through this person you know
it's something like that
 I think he yes he gives you Authority anyway
 you are an elegy was good enough not going to elaborate on that okay
 the Supreme Lord the description of the godhead Krishna is the master of all living of all other living entities and of the material nature is lotus feet are sought and worship by great saintly persons like the US none the less there are fools who consider Lord Krishna and ordinary human being ritualistic ceremonies were the principles austerities and the practice of yoga are all meant to control the senses of mind but even after he's able to control this has not come to the point of meditation upon the Supreme Lord all such a
these are simply labor in frustration the Oz framing out the conversation right all the rituals of The Vedas we all we may get inspired to renounce and going to meditation by different text on Tiana and yoga
 but the whole mission at the end of the path is the connection with that Supreme loving being who's the source of it all
 and if we never turned it if if our ego prevents us from turning in that direction then it's just kind of like spinning our Wheels is kind of like a lots of work that never connects you know like you could if you're sometimes a car gets stuck in some kind of goalie and the wheel spin yeah but there's no traction so you know are wheels of ritual a real Zen meditation maybe spinning like crazy but there's no traction it doesn't move forward actually
s29 as professional activities or business profits cannot help one in spiritual advancement butter a source of entanglement The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot help anyone who is not a devotee of the Supreme personality of God had such a straightforward statement answering all the questions I thought the rituals of The Vedas being dharmik doing your duty and varunastra Dharma being a good teacher are a good worker or a good leader a good business owner you do all that you do the right rituals and you enjoy the benefits of life I thought that's what The Vedas are pointing to wrong on the ladder
 but the ladder leads to this connection this beautiful personal love the love that we're all looking for that they will always feel incomplete without
 is only found there
right
 one who desires to conquer the Mind must leave the company of his family and living a solitary Place free from contaminated Association to maintain the body and soul together they should beg as much as they need for the bare necessities of life basically we need to do something when I post yesterday nothing will change if we don't change nothing changes if nothing changes if nothing changes nothing changes if nothing changes so that there needs to be some difference and if you're not going to just zip it up and walk away from your life you like you and I do we walk too short of away from our life
 that's not necessarily everybody's path but they have to walk away from old behaviors almost like old conversations what they enjoyed in that conversation
they have to walk away with a different live to walk away with a different mindset a different relationship to the world that has that can be cultivated internally as well
 it must be what you looking at I'll just checking out this little Schubert any Italian
 I got a cannoli in touch about any
 when you come that's a great verse isn't it my dear King in a sacred and holy place of pilgrimage one should select a place in which to perform yoga the place must be level in not too high or low
 there once you sit here comfortably being steady and equipoise keeping
body straight and dust begin chanting The Vedic on Ava the Raja yoga here
 practices
 what continuously staring at the tip of the nose alerted Yogi practices the breathing exercises through the technical means known as lorica kombucha and Rachel text the retention and hailing on the exhaling and the retention
 that's controlling an elevation excavation and then stopping the boat in this way
 the yoga restricts his mind from Material attachment and gives of all mental desires
 as soon as the mind being defeated by Lusty desires trips towards feelings of sense gratification the yogi should immediately bring it back and arrested within the core of his heart
play we start to notice that the mind wanders and we're very focused on what we're thinking about what we're talking about it would switch bleeding out of her mouth and then we start to notice the mine is almost at this naughty child that we have that keeps like whatever this is stealing candy or going into the pantry robbing robbing some little goodies snack or something like that where the candy store is a child is constantly taking care and we have to notice her mind before my mind is going mine is thinking of saying why does my mind go there and you got to get back here come back over here is a whole process of catching that just catching it and bring it back but changing it to inappropriate behavior is an appropriate way for the mind to be again when you and I were young relatively Young
 we got the opportunity to kind of get all caught up in this practice and this
chin and jaw they were kind of man that we admire that we're practicing it and it just kind of fully absorb their time and in that way to absorb their mind and we kind of learn to control the mind yeah you know it in ways that are you nor with us till I think without that
 it would feel like it's impossible to control the mind it would feel like come on man like the eyes want to go with the eyes want to go and see you know the Mind wants to go with mine wants to go and then you come up with theories like maybe you should just give in and let it go and healthy to resist this your ear you're creating frustration and you created you're burying your feelings you got to just let your mind do what it wants to do and I can beat anything you've been brought up with these a tight rope around your desires free yourself from those ropes born of patriarchy
Christianity leftovers you're a free being course tuba let me help you be your own Guru which is really saying let me be your Guru or let your senses be your Guru you know if you don't have that kind of if you don't get some kind of training and some kind of help and how to do it in a positive way it is likely will manifest in all kinds of frustration and oppression and being and all of that but there is a right way to do it just cuz there's a wrong way to do it doesn't mean that there's not a right way to do the differences between to sublimate and subjugate wordsmithing
 supplement supplement we take something some of that lower passion and we bring it to a higher place you know we're not just trying to like cranberry our feelings or bury our emotions or bury our drives which one to bring them to a higher place
nice weather like that you had a lot of stuff like that if you like it you can keep it and use it to give me credit but you can give you a little break and you know it. Here's a clue this is like it's some
 it's so important in it maybe something that you can pick up in other Realms and then applied in terms of controlling the mind but the fact is is that when you when you like for instance
 I think it specially now that we have such a short attention spans you know that have been your deteriorated due to the media that were consoling a regular basis in the bathroom is hard to read a book about people read books and just not into this but if you kind of just stick with it just for a little bit if you want to get over the hump and it really is tarun is been reading
an hour a day of Mahabharat
 love it so that principals there it seems impossible just it just takes a little momentum yeah get past it control in the mind is like that too it seems like it's going to be a possible not to check out every girl that's walking on the street is to be a possible not to sexually fantasize back after I see that refrigerator it's going to be a you know it's like it seems so hard but there's a certain threshold that you cross not even that far down the line if you just have faith becomes not not exactly easy but much easier
 well I've been dreading it up for some reason I've been dreading getting on my bicycle this year dreading it and so then I have a very small little loop I do which is sort of like I take a left out of super-soul driveway it's a small Loop it only takes you like 6 miles
and after doing that for a week I was like you know what I'm ready to do to real miserable Loop which starts off going up Shillings Crossing up take a right out of the driveway and it is just like a hill to a hill to a hill
 and I tell you I don't every morning I was like I don't want to do this
 and then I've Loved life and it's exhausting and and wonderful and miserable and you got to go slow just like right now I'm actually lamenting I'm not at home to do this Loop I'm going to do it later in the day but it's one of those things you just disappointed all of a sudden your thoughts and your mind and your ear fighting senses have become tamed just like a dog named you're coming out she know the real you not just the the tamed you know Concord you know in from A1 good choice you got a second choice so that's force me to eat
cleaner it a little better and now bored like John Maus to me I'm like Igor yam look eager to fastime John Maus to me you know it's it it just like one thing leads to it if your Indulgence Mom did you hear about okolicy which is a fast day I'll be here you're about a holy day like John Maus to be which of the which is a fasting day you become like how can I be trying to figure out how can I will I'll do a sort of a little bit of 13 hours how about that is that good enough with it that's something I'll chanson extra rounds don't make me faster Super One good choice leads to other good choices and then any develop that muscle
 I have faith have hope you could do it and it again to have that glue that you had to admire you can to like you know it's different when you just said I'm going to do on my own or when they
person you deeply Mars's okay do this now and within you there's like that kind of inner child at like okay yes I want to do it I want to please them I want to ship you know I like them encouraged by their it at that instructions become special is little enshrined in my heart now it gives you power you know it's a blessing it gives you power to do to do what you thought you liked that's where we started right where the coaches are saying a few things that a little hard to hear
 so that we can become what we were meant to become its powerful okay we'll see if we get another in my dear King in a sacred and holy place of pilgrimage one should select a place to do that sorry 32/33 continuously staring at the tip of the nose
 me to this 1234 she has not kept in the quote to the top
the page today
 when the yogi regularly practice is in this way in a short time their heart becomes fixed and free from disturbance like a fire without Flames or smoke oh yeah so they're inside your truck like the cooking fire in the short time they get over that threshold and now you're cooking you cooking when one's Consciousness is uncontaminated by material Lusty desires it becomes calm and peaceful and all activities for one who is situated in Eternal Blissful life once situated on that Platform One does not return to materialistic activities may not be able to appreciate this but I'll tell her now
 when they mentioned what we are waiting for the movie to start yesterday and I think Timothy Tiger goes yeah and they've got vegan donuts over there I was like in my brain I was like
I'm not eating vegan Donuts right now eating I would say it was a big win for me there I just want you to know that cuz I would have been like sprinting to the vegan donut place
 good choices lead to good choices write that down
 is 55 let's get some more
 when one's Consciousness is uncanny
 terminated by material us
 what countries is uncontaminated by material Lusty desires again less can be anything could be lost for vegan Donuts it becomes calm and peaceful and all activities for one is situated in Eternal Blissful life once situated on that platform what's not return to materialistic activities want to accept the cineas order gives up the three principles and materialistic activities
which one indulges in the field of household life they lead Arma Arthur, right religion Economic Development says gratification one of exception. But then returns to such materialistic activities is called a bunt a c
 or one who eats his own
 vomit in your mind if you were if we're practicing a strong Regiment of lifestyle and you appreciate the joy of that regimented lifestyle and then you go back to Old practices they say it's like you've given it up you giving up with you knew that I didn't satisfy those didn't real good which didn't make you be the best person and then you go back and do the same thing again
they say they'll just like once you throw it up you throw up something to eat and it's like you being some bad was it called like bad food like food poisoning that you would eat that again I disgusting is that that's what it is falling down from our from our path
 so we have to like get to that not just get to this level but we got to maintain it and then polish it and improve it
 yeah who wants to hear I'm eating my own vomit
 okay let's play 57 I think we should stop here I don't want to hear it
