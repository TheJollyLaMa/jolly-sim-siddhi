looking like so you go through different recipes we should do it again yoga it's looking like a like a cool interesting thing if you're interested in that are we out of a sudden that we're not trying to ask how will bring around without any further adue Robbie no welcome back to the show if we've had you when was the last time I've had you was like during the pandemic yeah I think it was like maybe 3 years ago it's hard to believe his name is hard to believe that's where we sort of first lot of people during that Penn damn if people are reaching out to us we had a podcast we weren't planning for a pandemic that was the other people might have had the plandemic but we did it we didn't know about it but that being said that's when we first connected and you were working on your film your film was coming out
and it was available only online rabanos of a filmmaker from England's north of London and he and his team have this incredible film you want to share a little bit about it and now it's going to be out in New York for a screening it's Ryan yet thanks so much for having me on B everyone and I couldn't help it I live in the UK but I'm actually already so I couldn't help noticing Mike Myers from Marlin getting a shout out there also road rage what it go to cool name to repulse Italo to yeah yes yes great to see so many of you online online because of the pandemic call a road to ring diamond cuz it's culminated sits in 1800 km Tokyo trip so any of you have been to a new you're seeing you no footage of a new you see these three will
autorickshaws the group was actually drove these ratios from Mumbai all the way down the west coast of India to kanyakumari at the very tip of India where you can see the three different options I have and then we went to Varun dhavan where there's a school for girls that you went you started in Mumbai when South and then went all the way back up to North End so sorry I must say you know we flew from can you cut me and David are the drive was another trip I said that I would be again so yeah we flew to her and that the middle school they're cold descend Upon A Mooney School in when David and it's specifically for girls and so the film started out just being about the trip and I'm trying to understand this reason that why do girls in India often not get and supported to continue with their education sometimes they started all but if they do start off tonight
T it stopped in there are many reasons which are also shared in the film we wanted to speak to people on the ground so that we're not just making our assumptions from the headlines or whatever we here in the west but actually from people on the ground something happens when I came back and I started editing the film somebody challenge me as a man and said why would use a man be interested in this is surely this is just a women's issue which got me thinking a bit more deeply about it and I reached out to people around the world including shika uberoi who was India's number one fractional tennis player and I'm sure she featured in the film as well so I went back to India for another whole month and this time I wanted to look at how do men play into this whole scenario and do they have a role to play in trying to change things and so on and you know what we spoke to Father's brother's you know a much broader range of people to see how could this change and she could set up a very powerful lying to me I interviewed her actually in New York Concentra
and she said you can actually Empower somebody into isolation now that sounds a bit strange but if you're take a person young girl from a very World location I knew educate her I was on the face of it seems like a great thing right and then she opens up her hopes and dreams and her aspirations and what her idea of her life might be like but she still stuck in a rural place which doesn't necessarily share that sort of understanding of the world and also she in terms of marriage typically the they will want to try and marry her to a boy who is more educated or somehow position more in their eyes in a superior position to her and somehow becomes very difficult for her so anyway so that's that. I thought you said there's no men that are more educated than her now so their pool of she's almost in a worse position potentially You could argue from one perspective
interested so my whole thesis then was if we want to offer more opportunities for girls and we need to look at the whole society and how how do we also encourage man and you know the broader Community to to learn more about these things so that it's not thinking that it's a simple solution just educate the girl I kind of think I'm weed the last sort of six months we started putting a film at the festival's again and and getting good Film Festival selections when is my Wards and one of them is in New York in 22nd Saturday 22nd of June which is coming up in about a month of June now the wisdom of the ages Retreat is happening so we're not going to be there which I'm a little sad about because I really want to ask for the retreat
 I know but I'm still in I'm still in Europe are you are you back you're still in you still I'm still in Europe yeah I'll be back okay
make it is a part of a film festival festival called her Vision International Film Festival it's going to be at a venue called slate which is in Manhattan I think it's a kind of a cool kind of venue where they have all kinds it's quiet Corky their kind of slides and all kinds of things but I have one big room which is like has a big screen and it's got screens all around and I think you can hold about 200 people so we're flying over myself and my producer Revan and we're going to do a Q&A afterwards as well so people would would like to check it out and come would love to say hello to you and see you there and I'll pop in just now in the chat a little bit about it and there's like a LinkedIn stuff to get some tickets if you'd like to come but yeah it's it's something that they understand what I found from we've just done some sold out shows in Birmingham in Dublin in Ireland and Don Q and A's afterwards and it's really nice to see it on the big screen and also to hear people's real-time responses
like something happens something special happens when when his life you know cuz you kind of get that interaction and I think one of them is as lovely as the universality of it even though the topics are on the screen or an Indian but actually you know many of these issues between gender stereotypes and stuff and protect me sometimes when we were looking at traditionalism there things that you know maybe we're navigating and around lives in different ways to wherever we are that is really appreciate in the filament how it illustrates through one issue just like a broader principle that what you know we were going to do something that we are dealing with
 maybe one or two quite q-and-a episodes ago where there's like
 the culture in the Nevada culture you know it has a purpose and it's meant to serve a purpose
it's not the goal the goal is Buck tea and sometimes the culture assist that and sometimes just with changing times and circumstances and applications of Miss applications of it can actually work against Hit And I think what what was really Illustrated well in that film was the need for tradition to constantly be reassessing if we're achieving the goal before and if our attempts to apply culture cultural norms cultural structures sairam to to examine whether they're helping or hurting sometimes you just get caught up and saying this is this is the way it's supposed to be done this is the way it is always been down it and if we're not careful those can work against us send it to bring a lot of suffering so that's what I'm supposed to do before I remember actually at the time. But you kind of used a phrase which is brilliant and it was something along the lines of like
tradition and culture principles that were originally maybe use to uplift and support and lift people up sometimes later on if not adjusted can can impress people that was the prophet that was brilliant cuz she probably did I say anything brilliant your support and encouragement was bringing are all we want to thank you Robbie is there any way to see it if we can't go on the 22nd or we going to do there will be but I'm I'm kind of just doing this Runner okay real-time screenings first and then the name of the film has changed now right yes yes so it was called road to bring the oven and then when we started then speak into Distributors and stuff which has the name a girl can touch the sky which is actually a line that one of the girls in the film says I was asking the group of girls what you want to be and one of them said she wants to be a policewoman
he wants this arrest people who Force girls to get married do you know when they're really young another one said I want to be an astronaut and I said where you want to go and she goes to the moon and then I and then she said yes a girl can touch the sky a girl can do anything so it's just a line from the film and I think it kind of maybe says a bit more on the 10 I'll give you a better idea what it's about us right away I love it I love it it's great so we're going to promote it it's going to happen the 22nd we encourage everybody to go and our community support and spread the word about it and also we're going to leave the details in the show notes and even if you're not here thanks for all you keep up the good work thank you so much appreciate the opportunity to come on if if if you're not around you or can you would want to see it later the website's a girl can touch the sky., checking then we'll put the online screening at later on that's great girl can touch the sky. Calm yeah thank you so much have a great day
courtesy thank you very much everybody was beautiful before we start in the shoe my back but tell him which is every means of Conquest when should I be respectful of base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Brian Ricci the super most human being into mother star Swati the goddess of learning and she'll be off today of the author not stop her you a show about a shooting at your mug at Save-A-Lot bag of it to you too much low-key talk to you in about 15 I sticky a regular tennis in classes in the bottom of tongue and by rendering service to the pier.

knowledge
 after my base and seized after Lotus feet could read them I would love to. I would love to hear them ugly 7 versus something I got 67 versus sure all right cuz today is the day huh today is a day to celebrate his appearance there's so many different appearance in Christianity you celebrate appearance of Christ who's the guru so we also have that group or name we we celebrate the guru's in our life and all the different avatars of the Lord are also celebrated and because you unlimited avatars as unlimited holidays it's not just you like holiday season the whole year is a holiday season but I am the big one this is a big one Christmas tree today is a big Avatar and it's falls in the month of you know
you know it's chandan yatra so the Lord can be celebrated with Chung done everyday for this one cuz it's the hot season right now and let his chundan stranded at DD covered in the sandalwood paste hardened during these chapters I read a little something from Rupa goswami snuggle bug with him retard where he doesn't go into detail so much about why but he identified their the form of the nursing Avatar the half man half lion avatars being like one of the three or this Krishna does ROM and then there's not a similar kind of like elevated to the like this so that is very important and down
 so yeah there's so many Lila avatars so many Avatar so many
music forms Krishna takes you takes there so many kinds of varieties of avatars with the Lila avatars it's his it's his play it's his Adventure is Adventures of love now they they did many other purposes served through them but ultimately there they are his adventures of love in this form was just so
 abuta are just so wonderous that Reid speaks to that but I have almond on the scene has to bother me some
 it says I offer my basin Sazon to the ocean of mercy of Hubble and a string of this is from a set of prayers that are chanted in in the whole lot have you never been there I never been there since South India we got to go there let's go
 that's where they have the cave right yeah but you got to like sort of like a lead weight in through
water is going to really want to see the Lord you got to weigh it in through and even in the template is in a cave right and in your in that cave in the water like up to your waist in the water and that's how you did that's how you take your DocuSign and people get married in their hand in the water and the kid wedding dress collection purses that are chanted there in that Temple I offer my bases on to the ocean of Mercy a whole Bella notice email
 here's the unfortunate Supreme Lord but I'll Havana and nursing, his heart I like this part his heart
 is frolicking with his own playful pastimes but that's what we're reading about right now he's sitting there he's like all of angry still tore up that demon who was losing his his beloved devotee but it's like his hardest prep is frolicking in the love that he's exchanged
whisper lied in the most intelligent persons pray to him the Supreme Soul fascinates the great sages that form it is fascinating, I suppose the form itself as well as its purpose and it's it's what it shares and how it manifests in on it but here's another one
 let me offer my basement isn't it Lord in the Shanghai Diva who is always enlightening prolonged Mirage within his heart
 and who always kills the ignorance that attacks the devotees
 is did this is helping us understand what to pray for it his Mercy is distributed like the Moonshine
 and his face is like that of a lion let me offer my vases stand again again I moonshine here does not mean like a home distilled alcohol Hillbillies make some moonshine
his mercies are the Moon is famous for being cooling so the Moonshine has a cooling effect now and it said I supposed to discriminate like we reading yesterday but without partiality the moon spread this phrase everywhere it says cooling it's it's impartial but he's in the heart he's enlightening the Harvest eovaldi and just as he kills
 viciously effortlessly dramatically kills her and Akashi Pooh he's killing that ignorance in the heart of the devotees this is this going to be a prayer Eric Wright like you're learning a day yeah please destroy the ignorance in my heart and my mind and my heart
 okay this one on the mobile between Allison higher
 Namaste just agency of your of your Bob I offer my a bit respectful obeisances unto the Lord Mercy Madiba the source of all power
oh my Lord possesses nails and teeth that are just like Thunderbolts
 I need Vanquish similar pepper Connelly Vanquish our demon like desires for food of activity in this material world please appear in our hearts and drive away our ignorance so that by your mercy we may become Fearless in the struggle for existence in this material world Consciousness right we we we have to learn to develop this some one pointed focused on the goal this is Michael and I need your mercy to achieve it I want all of that I don't want to try to relish the darkness that's in my heart that ignorance the attraction the desires for things that are separate from God I want Ashley to get it all that kicked out in wholeheartedly. I did Lie by VIN
cities of prayers for that time
 for that kind of for help on that that I just want to but in here we just had I just had a meeting while you were talking with Mara at what I did was I muted myself so you couldn't see and I started ventriloquist mouth like where was it moving my lips and says hey I want to go to sleep meerakrishna tonight and marriage like all kind of Sweet Baby Krishna time maybe we do sweet baby I just don't know if he appears as bothering us a table Ela or ceiling like that sounds good when you were talking it to remind me like you know what we what do something tonight time will that be at 8 p.m. tonight or put it out there in yes okay here's another for you please hit me hit me all this is a beautiful prayer that prolonged praise
you know one similar to last chapter it's interesting to see how yoss composes about what time the last chapter we kind of we brought different people from the universe into one spot
 and they all prayed from there different angles division 2 National Day in the Box until we traveled throughout the Universe right along the path that the ganga takes from the top to the bottom and we heard prayers to Lord Vishnu from all those different types of residents into there's two examples of where we hear from different layers in a different layers of Consciousness from the different layers of beings on the different layers of the universe so this was spoken by Pearl odd in the fifth Canto offering prayers May There Be Good Fortune throughout the Universe this is one of those really auspicious kind of when you want to invoke some auspiciousness some good vibes and the other one this is
Lecanto 18 chapter Tech Nine of the human body with a good fortune throughout the Universe and may all envious persons be pacified
 okay they all living entities become calm by practicing about the yoga for by accepting devotional service they will think of each other's welfare
 therefore let us all engage in the service of the Supreme Transcendence Lord SRI Krishna and always remain absorbed and thoughts of him is great I love the fact that were in this part of the baggage home today yeah me too I'll get two more please
 oh this is a sweet one thing I like this one I think
 although very ferocious
 the Lioness is very kind to her Cubs
 simerly although very ferocious to now
I've always liked her and Akasha poo Lourdes nursing my diva is very very soft and kind to devotees like prolonged Maharaj
 furry Paul coming out again I like sometimes you see a guy's got like a pet lion and they're just like Patty you ever see those videos were like someone like they helped raise the line and then they come in and they don't see it for like 10 years in a comeback his hind legs and hug and somebody else comes over there okay and then finally this is a verse that the devotees chance even daily
 keto dressing up for the toll nursing home yet do you have to yeah me to turn in the same Hole by here Nursing Home Free Die a national nursing home and then shutting them property he's over there and he's in my heart is also going to hear he's also there
he's inside and he's outside as well it's in my heart he's outside as well
 I surrender to Lourdes nursing and Stringham Adam shouted out of nonprofit education and I take shelter of him the origin of all things in the Supreme Refuge
 that's how we need to see he's here he's there there's no where he's in this pillar or is he not my heart is in your heart heart of every living being interesting little side note that Prairie Champion iskcon Temple is probably took that from two different prayers and put it together and we made it into a song it's a new thing and proud pie. I think it was when he probably was getting sick and he asked the devotees to champus and one is from I think I did was want me the second part that's the other that's the what is it the jocks Avatar stotram yeah
 hey beautiful when you get a song terracotta, love
keep up with the music to that now that Melody some all over India
 not sure yeah yeah and
 and then the first part you know I actually it's funny that you mention that because they
 that's why I saw where that beginning of it came from there the first two verses that we sing but I didn't know that down I bet I remember looking at it yes I do that's what it's from maybe I can go back and find a little niche it on the charger look that up where is that from my prayers that we sync our list I've been to the bottom of time here sir redvers 28 + 27 chapter 9 x 28 and 4 lot of speaking
 my dear Lord of supreme personality of godhead because of my association with material desires
been there done that still doing it one after another I was gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes and we talked about that. The other day with the Scorpions Here stripping into a well and I think I mentioned this before that I've know how many times in India who have fallen into well
 cuz the Grass Grows over them and there's no like lip or Rim around it in India they just dig Wells the wells dry up and then people stop using in the grasses grow over them people just walking through a field
 if you dig a well please build a little rhythm on the well be a hundred years old and the phone to allow full of snakes following the how do you do that we'll just following the general populist right
Insidious the people make bad choices and we move like sheep really
 but your servant Narda Mooney kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve the strands of dental position there for my first duty is to serve him how could I leave his service ever see these like kids would do this I never do this I think this is nuts but it get into a giant tire and push each other down a hill ever see people do that it's ridiculous the cheapest like you have I have yeah it's crazy but it's his this is what it's like for the living entity in some Sarah meaning you're just spinning and spinning and spinning and also those things are bouncing over rocks and it's dangerous and could crash into something this is material existence were on this wheel rolling down a hill lots of trouble ahead and we're helpless you can't get out and then Google comes over here like gives it a bit and
like it gives you this access point out of that spinning tire and get gives you the opportunity for Freedom if you want to reach out the girls come in extending their hand and the girl comes in the form of humans right come to the form of pure devotees comes in in the disciples and comes in the form of transcendental literature but you have to want you have to also extend your hand out word no matter how much the Google reaches in you got to also reach out and that's how we get out of this perpet this wheel of disaster this
 like a toilet bowl Tire snake pit Bowl rolling wheel and Vitamix
sensual aspect of the the heart the mind the heart of the box of Yogi here is this attitude of gratitude and we're speaking the other day about the siege of Gaza on Odessa that on the servant of the servant for a lot of standing before Lord Vishnu who appeared for his own as a as a favour under him specifically right
 it was me with my new fidget her that Maya gave me it's like a so I wonder if it's helping or hurting it's meant for preschoolers
 but but but let's let's let's understand the context here
 Vishnu appear not just in general but specifically for one ended
you're here forever. A lot could easily say thank you for appearing to me may I always be connected to you like this directly but he doesn't say that
 in that moment rather than thinking you know cuz he even that that you know could make one feel like I'm so great you know God came for me if he even though the Dave is here he didn't come for they all try to settle him down they all failed they chose me to come before him he came for me
 but it's a rather than any drop of that egoistic pride manifesting in his heart he's actually saying you know Lord to serve you I want to serve you're devoting our de if it wasn't for him I would know anything I wouldn't know you I wouldn't be receiving this that this causes Mercy that you're showering upon me right now
so he says he can accepted me as a disciple he instructed me how to achieve the position that I'm in right now therefore in this is praised very in a very poor my my first Duty my primary duty is to serve him how could I leave his service not that I don't need his service in my body cheap the goal I don't know right I I I served him it's it's a very instructive statement and I think really important you know I've always found them to be very important for the for the followers of the prophet in a recognizing his contribution
 and I'm feeling you know what my duty is to serve him without him I don't know any of this stuff or I'm clueless if he didn't get on a boat have a couple heart attacks you know on a month-long Journey crossing over several oceans
 and then you know Live Paris penniless Lee in New York you know just trying to
crack it in all in all of this Western so-called civilization to deliver this message if he wouldn't sacrifice in the way they did as an old man without any money I would know anything of this so my duty is to serve him and I think that's a very healthy attitude just to remember for all the people that God has tagged
 to instruct us to touch our hearts it's a beautiful meditation people have just come out of the woodwork to lift me higher and it's sort of like some of them could say these people are pure devotees and some of them there were not. Buzz whatsoever but Christian to use them once we make a declaration like I want God in my life I want truth in my life I want light in my life I want to be more spiritual person watch The Magic app and watch people get sent to you to bring you hire and end by just appreciating that
that's the beginning beginning of her bhakti that that did God uses people and sometimes the most unlikely people to Lift Us higher
 okay so so now provides made his the statement and now he's going to he's going to kind of shift gears of it here we are going to hate purses or so he's going to begin what kind of starts to entered in this next ex while we read the next text in the whole year
 text 29 oh my Lord unlimited Reservoir Dental qualities you have killed my father hiranyakashipu it's saved me from his sort he had said very angular angrily if there is any Supreme controller other than me let him save you feel now sever your head
your body that's what he was thinking there for I think that both in Saving me and in killing him you have acted just to prove true the words of your devotee right there is no other costs to the verse what's the verse of the bug of agita fucked-up pronuncia T the words of my devotees or
 set my device used here is an Ulta
 which means Unlimited
 proper translate sit as unlimited Reservoir Transit inequalities because sometimes when people think of the Supreme the absolute truth they think all that is unlimited
but unlimited has no qualities unlimited means devoid of a variation devoid of qualities just a divine
 you know energy yeah it's just a Divine Oneness to Divine energy but probably you know what I think it it's it's in one sense is this is kind of poetic instructional kind of license that he's at he's engaging but it's but it's there's no doubt about it because it has been called a nun that he's been called and there but he's there in 4 minutes for that has a particular man in particular clause in particular teeth in particular eyes and its own all these the description of his qualities has been given but he's also been called unlimited sofas unlimited he's not an unlimited
 you know 12 some unlimited you know why quality less
he's an unlimited Reservoir Transit on qualities which is supposed to the fundamental
 you know steam or you no speak to that fundamental question is God a person
 okay so now we're going to let you know you no problem now for a lot. Just had this little boy he's going to speak on a level that some poor because all these say just say just like pilate and the sages that preceded him they've always held that our existence isn't like an accidental byproduct that arises out of Justice random interactions of dust and gas in the big void of space
 but rather they're saying you know if we look into this you know we've been talking a lot about science and stuff if we look into nature you know
 there's messages to discover there that even we can see that this is a finely-tuned world you know if we look
without truly objectively and we could see that we appeared deeply into it enough we can see it's finely tuned in and that there's a purpose to it and there's messages that were meant to gain from it that there's a that there's a designer
 behind it there's an there's a you know there's like a intelligent design if there's any others until John is an engineer that's operating it for a purpose and so now for the next eight or nine versus plants going to speak on that level he's going to eat here we find it you know we're a lot where other spiritual Traditions make sure a lot of wisdom here we get detailed accounts of how God works How the Universe Works that really speaks a lot of the fundamental philosophical questions that people are struggling with still today
 my dear Lord you alone manifest yourself as the entire Cosmic manifestation for you existed
where did creation you exist after the annihilation and you are the maintainer between the beginning and the end all this is done by your external energy through actions and reactions he's man reactions of the three Lunas have three modes of material nature there for whatever exists externally and internally is you alone okay you know there's so much in that you know that that there's a person behind it that everything is his energy and therefore everything is one in that sense but at the same time it's separated and transformed into to all different kind of varieties
 that by his power he puts it through cycles of creation and an Annihilation and he maintains it through all of that and he's he's he's saying you would people have these questions that the philosophers have debated these questions forever but he's he's speaking it you know and it's being recorded here so that we can
so that so that we have a guidebook as we pass through this universe
 my dear Lord Supreme personality of godhead the entire Cosmic manifestation Cosmic creation is caused by you and the cosmic manifestation is an effect of your energy I loved the entire Cosmos is but you alone you keep yourself aloof from it the concept conception of mine and yours is certainly a type of Illusion Amaya because everything is in an emanation from you and is therefore none different from you and Dee the cosmic manifestation is not different from you and me and my Elation is also caused by you this relationship between your lordship and the cosmos is illustrated by the example of the seed and the tree or the shuttle cause and the gross manifestation to see it in the tree very interesting I didn't again so much here
 that
everything in the cosmos is a manifestation of Christians energy
 but most people when we manifest anything like when you walk past that stone wall that you build Runner
 yes
 deep inside you so just a little bit and that's my wall
 I created this thing you can create nothing has rocks secondhand God the Rocks were there long before you arrived and even the ability to lift the rock is granted to you the body with what you lifted the intelligence that you engage in arranging it it's all gifted to you we are not creators were manipulators so so so we turned it as soon as we create anything we begin to identify it with us and we become attached
 a lot of saying everything there's nothing that's not your energy and at the same time you're aloof from it
 because you
Aldi press that are seven cities to live forever because he's just concerned with Divine love that's what it's absorbing his Consciousness but but he but this aloofness speaks to hit to who he is and what his nature is what is absorption is so is it he saying India to sound different from you but it's all yours is all yours and but but it's same time you're aloof this relationship between your lordship in the cosmos is illustrated by the example of the seed in the tree
 or the subtle cause in the gross manifestation I guess the tree gives off a seed and within that seed is everything for the next such a fuss at you know lately I've been not you not going to find a nice place in the park to sit and chant the morning and it's fast and like I was looking at one tree there's one tree is massive and where is most of the trees are really green right now right
what kind of tree this is but it down Oak I don't I don't think it's at all. That's what does is early on it turns all dry and brown in a pumps out all the seats
 and the seeds are did they they they dry out and they did their these flat kind of paper e little circles
 and inside that sits a little seed wrapped up in that dried little kind of paper each circle might want to talk I could find out because I got bottomless bust out your picture this app no idea what I do have is a map of every tree and Central Park and tells you exactly what kind of treated there's an app we just have we just have the app gives us so I don't have the the little scene with your butt but it's fascinating to look at that inside that you know cuz it's
translucent practically that alright that packaging in the center of it is a tiny little seed that is like a little computer chip you know with a soul in it it's work of art meets in a magical scientific project yeah yeah yeah yeah I understand it externally you can't you can't figure that stuff out and then and then you don't because it gets dry and Flaky when the breeze comes its suits these things out in the air is full of them
 right it's like it's almost like raining the seats and they all the wind carries them and then they land on the ground where they can take or an animal comes and eats it right and then and then
With the Wind can carry it to the since the animal can carry two distance
 it's a magical world right and it's so so so in one sense the tree that's seed is the product of the tree to tree gives it its its body of the seed it gives it the encoded unlimitedly intrakid you know computer code that it will need the DNA and whatever it is that the tree has that'll make you grow exactly is that tree will grow and then it sends it off you know what like a $0.01 aloof I assume that that's what's being said here by the example of the seed in the tree is Krishna just like a treat his office is it has the ability to turn into something so you know that Krishna that he's he's encoding everything he says he's the the master of the
 of the computer the computer coding and just creating you know all unlimited mind Boggle
varieties of life

 interesting after the annihilation meaning after this is all over is still there the universe is still there it's just like winter time so I know it's dormant right now and then it's going to birth in the spring who appear to sleep with half-closed eyes it's in you who appear to sleep with have closed eyes actually however you do not sleep like an ordinary human being for you are always in a transcendental stage Beyond creation of this material world and you always feel transcendental Bless you that's remain in your transmittal status not touching
objects although you appear to sleep the sleeping is distinct from sleeping and ignorance I mean theology that's presented and Bobby, just passing right it's saying that cuz palatas he's offering a prayer to a manifestation of Vishnu going to Spring day but I know that you are that Maha fish in the car and a duck say Vishnu that this form of Vishnu that is the sole of the entire universe that lies down you know end in the universe in the water of the universe and from its pores unlimited the bubble of the material Realm

hundred years, you it's like some incalculable I forget maybe maybe Mary can look at that how many years has per mile if I forget it's like the Fibonacci spiral they live a whole lifetime but it's gigantic it's like the lifetime of a honey bee oh yeah but even I'd like a Dar life isn't even close it's so that Lifetime and we are in the 28th Kali Yuga the 50 first year of the current brahmas life okay so that that lifetime what was it 300 something surely 11 211 trillion years
 that is the life of the universe right it goes it if you breathe out and breathe back in
and then just like on an inhale we we in hell
