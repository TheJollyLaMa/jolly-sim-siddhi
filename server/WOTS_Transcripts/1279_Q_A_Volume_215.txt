 Anonymous via email and that's how you can send in your questions via email if you like wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com do your sages please accept my humble obeisance stages stages are in the pages we are just the readers readers of the books
 I bet your sages please accept my humble obeisance he's all go
it's just real problem pod I thank you again for your beautiful service I really look forward to my daily dose a bag of a Tom have a question I was hoping you can help with she the problem pyrites many times about how we should associate with the devotees only and yet another place as he talks about how a first-class to vote he sees Krishna everywhere and everything to these contradict each other and they give some examples that I'm not going to read I ask because my husband and I are totally at odds with how to practice this particular teaching on a side note they're both interested in bacta it's not like one of them is not interested they're both interested in him out I have kept in touch I have kept in touch with my friends from 3
 iskcon Hari Krishna days due to the due to their character they are kind non-judgmental respect boundaries and many of them have faith
may call Krishna Allah God or higher power
 yes I get that the philosophy isn't exactly the same as ours but it doesn't matter to me we've known each other since we were children and been through life's up and down together exams examples are jobs parents illness cetera and I joined a 12-step program which is not part of the brg and my husband was hugely triggered by this
 I have to vote I have devoted friends too but I don't feel like my nan Dove buddy friends need to be ditched to me it seems extremely extreme to only associate with abilities but my husband feels like if we want to get Krishna Prema quickly we need to hang out with people who are aiming for the same thing
this point and perhaps I'm just not ready to let go but I also feel like I'd regret isolating myself on the basis that some people don't use the same word for Krishna as I do yet it is easier to speak to the people who follow the same lifestyle who get the commitment to chanting the desire to eat for shot them only the cetera but surely occasionally stepping out of that isn't going to harm things is it thank you. What can we do okay no 14 question answer it now I'm going to use an example of the TV show that me and Mara watched was a four-part series on Netflix called unorthodox and what about a I might even get the whole thing wrong the premise but it was about this girl born in a Hasidic Jewish
family in Williamsburg Brooklyn and you know that's a pretty strict you know are parentheses are quotes cult in one sense dangerous called necessarily but it's just for like they are into their own culture and they haven't and they have their they isolate themselves or pushing themselves from the rest of the world and there's not a lot of room for stepping out of sight of that circle like she was a piano player but she had to do its secrets yet to learn secretly and she couldn't perform publicly and there a lot of rules upon men and women and there were a lot of
 you know I like to call them sort of Alicia's that they're their put on and it reminded me of the living here in ashram there was a lot of leashes that we had one of Alicia's I was on when I was in the Ostrom was when I was a new devotee I was highly discourage
from visiting my family
 and I was like hey back off back off I'm going to go visit my mother I wouldn't like I would go shaming me going
 and I saying I forget who it was but there's a particular what I think there was a particular Swami speaking at a particular event I'm sink especially in those early days we saw like the Close Associates Real Property is practically like the the Apostles of Jesus you're going to miss out and see if I get it and sold it and this is the point I want to bring up so I was encouraged by maybe the senior devotees and Chris Duba
not to go home but I just want anyway and
 in retrospect I think we have such a great thing right now with was when the sages because we are in one Sense on a leash
 yeah we're sort of off the leash as well like for example there's a reason why a dog is on a leash I know with my own
 dog is not so responsible and he will wander away if he's not leashed he'll wander off the yard and sometimes into really dangerous situations like off my dirt road and into the main road and then there's been many times we've had calls from people to Jesus your doggie Fountain walking on 295 which is coming their Affair and he could easily get killed at the same time you want to give him some Freedom too and he'll want to just keep a dog and Alicia kills me when I see dogs on leashes all the time
even if it's a Long Leash so this is the thing about this TV show unorthodox is she sort of breaks away is when it runs away from the Hasidic Jewish community and now she's hanging out with a cool free artistic friends who are like encouraging and encouraging her artistic self for the same time she's in a falling into a culture that is got no parameters or No Boundaries so I think with it the back to the question here they're up there is a leash put in place that problem pot says hey don't associate with any non devotees and for some people there like yes not going to do that not going to go see my parents not going to go off my yard not going to do it I'm going to put the leash on at all times
 and then some of us some of them like this lady saying you know what I want to go off my leash and you know what I trust myself I'm not going to walk in the road and they both have
validity to it and
 sometimes when the leash is on we can really get caught up in a in a short-sighted like she saying also in a short-sighted view of reality and we can maybe not
 and their information from other sources outside of our bubble that can also assist me on my spiritual path that's one reason why we like introduced nugget if you're unfamiliar with our show it's where we bring in spiritual or secular thinker philosopher yet speaks relevant truth that we can apply to our life and and is in line with the teachings of another through my bag of am released their statement is and we say wow at now I can see the bottom of time through this through Aristotle or through Tolstoy or something like that and so some people really
like that and appreciate it and some people will criticize us and say why are you sticking to the bottom of time if so many great Saints you could you know you could you could quote so it's this idea of
 sticking to a tradition or being caught up in the tradition where you be hindered and you feel sort of like your wings have been clipped and I think everybody's got to make that individual choice and if you are off the leash you have to be careful not to wander in off no into the road you have to be wandering careful not to wander into Maya and you don't you go to a 12-step meeting like she said she did sometimes there's a lot of Maya and 12-step meetings you know because you're dealing with all types of people who have very sometimes very weak boundaries or neuter recovery or don't have the same values you do so you have to be very strict in your values pics I will say the values we hold on Arbok CPAP it's a very very
high standard and sometimes it can be a little suffocating to some people and sometimes they are exactly what we need so it's hard to sit give you a straight answer because it sounds like you're understandably two different individuals that need different things and within any relationship there's got to be some respect for what each other's needs but at the same time
 you also want to be in a place where you're not doing and something to really if it's going to really aggravate your partner as well I have to give a little bit but sometimes they're they're still caught up in their in their own maybe insecurities that they can't necessarily let you off the leash that much and it's a cross between you'll sort of like
 what's your acquiescing or him loosening up there
got to be some balance and maybe that's something you can work on necessarily with a therapist or a counselor because I don't know both of you you're sometimes people are really really in their own beer mode and therefore you're going to lose you and sometimes there's some truth to that maybe it'll maybe or maybe you're a flirt or maybe you're not but that person was abandoned at a young age and therefore they're not trust that trustworthy they need a very they need a very tight leash and they want they need back into control
 I know someone like Mara she's waiting cuz she's she's she's not jealous at all she has no jealousy she's not suspicious she's not cuz she had a very very weird to talk to a girl shouldn't be jealous at all it's not just how she rolls but some people they need a little tighter leash in the in a relationship and sometimes you have to respect that and sometimes that person is
she has to grow out of their own insecurities and develop trust that's part of their growth as well just going to be unique and all cultures you do like where I was going with that these that these multiple analogies the leash dirt road the dog collar the the Orthodox sent you what you're saying is you don't know if you need it it's going to be unique and different situations and sometimes it's a combination of both and sometimes people your partner is in so much anxiety that if they were to give you any leash it's going to cause like so much hell in their life but truthfully that he'll could also wrecked our relationship I agree and I'm kind of in the same place where you are right now in other words in reading this letter we really don't know that there's there's two competing principles here
 right one is the funeral
everyone accepts that who we associate with is very important in our life in general
 and when it comes to spiritual practice and Buckley practice it's been laid out for us in our ancient sacred texts that this is very important right who you're associated with the consciousness of the people that you associate with particularly closely and terms of friendships that's going to be, important in that will affect your own Consciousness okay so everyone except that now the question is is your husband's concern is he right on when he's saying the people that you're so shading with they're not involved in the same about the practices you are and their Association is going to drag you down in and I I kind of sense that it's likely that in this marriage you knows two people going into together soon let's practice back together seriously and let's make this the focus of our life and so if that's the case then the husband may be saying
I went into this with a certain understanding and seems like you're not really living up to your part and if that concerns me I'm concerned for you I'm concerned for how it affects our own unity in the path of a walk in on insulin talking about our marriage you and mikah scuba your him and I'm her and so then maybe he's right on maybe he's got the whole thing figured out and maybe she's right on this one second I'm going to go there so it's a but maybe that concern is 100% on the mark now the other side of that question is that when we when we approached bhakti and immature
 practitioner is likely more concerned with the external superficial aspects of the practice where is someone that's deeper is going for the more spiritual substance right so it sounds
what you're saying here is that my husband he's he wants me to reject people because they are not part of our official spiritual group
 but what I see in them is that they have the their focus on the same spiritual Essence that I that I'm focused on and so that's a deeper understanding I don't need to reject them based on superficial things why can't he see things in profits in and then she said so those are the two competing viewpoints now my guess is there's probably lying somewhere in the middle right it's like this is probably truth on both sides and in Pride the concern in the ideas and both sides both have some validity even in this particular case I doubt its wings all the way to one side
 I like what you shared run out about you mentioned something about like mediation or something like that and it or counselor or something like that I'm not saying that you need to go to a counselor or mediator but
I do feel like there's not clear communicate that it's very likely that the two sides are not really understanding each other a couple things that are friends mentioned that she'll probably said how a first-class devotee of Krista C's Christian everywhere
 and and everything that's true
 but are we those first with what he says first class that's not even he's not to speaking in a general sense he's alluding to something very specific right he's alluding to the Mahabharata but it said that there's three levels of devotees right and in the third class devotee had sees things in a certain way in the second class to vote is making very clear distinctions in really concerning who they associate with and how they associate with him and the First Class Tours the person that's already on an incredibly high level of of aware
spiritual awareness for them everywhere but we're not like that if we're not on that level we need to be very careful who who were associated with it and if we are aware Krishna when we're in their presents or do we become less aware of Christian wear their presents so that's one thing she mentioned that her husband comes hugely triggered by the fact that she's in a 12-step program that's not a bhakti 12-step program I would imagine if we asked him he would send me a hugely triggered I'm just very concerned that you know that he may have valid concerns you may have I guess what I'm saying is when we use language like that it's likely we don't understand each other so well we we really need to be able to articulate the concerns of the other person in this is what this has to be the first thing I suggest right the 20 sure one more example when when she wrote I regret isolating myself on the basis that some people don't use the same word for cry
as I do my guess is that that does not incapsulate your husband's concerned I doubt it's just merely the fact that they use another name to refer to God it I would imagine he has concerns that go beyond that and so when you talk to each other if you're just throwing these kind of superficial
 characterizations of the other person's position back and forth and you don't get anywhere so you really have to sit down and say let me see if I understand your concern
 you know you seem to be concerned that my my seriousness and commitment to practicing what is being compromised in an important way by the people that I'm associated with is that correct yes that's it it's not just the name Krishna that that's that's my concern and then and then he should be able to say your concerns your point is that you have some good friends in life they may not be part of your particular spiritual group
but they're valuable people and you value their friendship in their friendship is not in any way compromised in your your your the commitment it and in the commitment to your practice and in the the evolution of your of you of your spiritual awareness okay now at least we understand each other my guess is it's something like that and then and then you can talk will how do you see it affected me do you see it do you actually see it affect me in a can you show me how how it's affecting me in a negative way cuz I could show you some way that I feel it's it's helped me in a positive way and in this way you know you try to really understand each other you know and and I think that's where this has to go you know I think that's what it could be
 it could go either way and here's another point and I think we're going to kind of kind of smoke a little bit to this to let's say
that there's truth in what let's say that the two of you did kind of go into this Union with the idea that yes we we want practice this together in a serious way that's why we're choosing each other as lifelong partners because we both share that commitment is a very fundamental part of our of our relationship
 and let's say that your husband is recognizing some truth there's some truth in what he saying that maybe her her her focuses is becoming a little bit less sharp because she hangs out with his friends
 and he he wants to get your you out of receiving his own compassion for you and maybe even his own concern for his own practice he wants to make sure we're all staying focused right and it his way of doing that is to kind of pressure you
 to leave these friends behind in some way
that may not work you know he might have to try another strategy which which which might require patients like if this is not devastating to your spiritual practice right if it isn't one thing it's really you know if it's really compromising your focus maybe it's maybe it is affecting your focus but not not in such a devastating with it then he might just have to inspire you with patients he might just have to to evolve himself and it with the idea that if if I stay very focused and I'm not alienating her
 my pressurising her to give up friends that are important to her just by my own focus in in in in the own happiness is developing in my life when Once when she sees that the happiness that I'm developing with my clearer Focus then she will be inspired you know to follow so we can
always push people to be doing these things and I have a feeling all these things that I play I think we need to understand each other very clearly we need to be able to articulate very clearly the position of the other person so well that they say you said that even better than I can say that should be that should be the test and when you really understand each other then read then you can talk and you can really talk about this in Sialkot then then both sides have to be open to it to understand another person's viewpoint
 and ultimately we can't exactly make people do the things they have to it's so much
 if he were to pressure her to give up his friends
 there's a good possibility that that's going to manifest in some sort of resentment that's going to be problematic to the relationship
 if she's going to let go of hang out with his friends if it is a real problem
she's going to need to be inspired to do it for this tooth to grow in a healthy way I think that's an important point you so all of this is you know if all of this is up been out there and had to mature people have to try to to work through this together what do you say brother yeah I think that that's right on it unless you could be big enough to be empathetic there's going to be resentment the more I was thinking about this the more I realize this is a very very very thing what are
 so just maybe call you out on it and just see your second thing are you a flirt are you a flirt do you need a lot of validation and she's sometimes what happens is we search out the very person that is going to push all of our buttons and of course that's a great thing to grow so a person who is may be riddled with
pics of person who and has an it may be No Boundaries or was perhaps a type of Abandonment they choose the person who is emotionally unavailable and will not has no desire to settle down or something like that not saying this is you and this case but we pick a person who was also you know out there need tons of validation and because of that the very person whom I love lemon partnership is triggering me with everything and therefore sure that person from ziya T but I'm acting in such a way they say exacerbating it so one question for the writer the the lady of this is Amaya flirt that needs a lot of validation because
 part of loving a person part of being in love part of light bright like we said yesterday what are raising kids
do you want us to be happy do we say that in class yesterday I'm doing this to grow I'm doing this to evolve I'm doing this to evolve and part of that is being empathetic to the person I love is needs so yeah maybe it's a little enabling
 but at the same time cuz maybe I'm a little loose around the edges as well and if I do love this person made is going to help them grow at the same time at the leash is too tight like a stupid to say it can be strangling and get resentful too so yeah I agree with you to see if we have to be empathetic for the other four for other things for this to actually work out peacefully or you're going to grow old together bitter with each other but
 is basing some reality to be based in summer
I didn't remember we got to check ourselves a little bit I didn't get the impression that there was a flirtation element in this I just don't have a very common thing with people who are people and anxiety they may need some validation of the need them self out there more than this other person is I'm not saying it is but it could because I've seen it happen again and again
 you know what I appreciate the question a lot out to the two of you I suggest you both really try to understand each other and work through this together
 try to understand what's going on with our questions good question
 when I read the question sometimes you do that was do that okay this coming in from Chad via Discord he's got two questions
okay take them one at a time
 there's a similar element in this question actually
 he writes in addition to program pod
 is it beneficial to times to get wisdom and truth from other teachers let's say for example moochie for ROM. Etc it just seems that at time that there it just seems there are times
 were these overlap and universality amongst I think there's there's some problem in the grammar sense but I think what he's saying is it seems that sometimes there's a lot of overlap in University ality amongst so many teachers
 I wouldn't suggest having multiple gurus
 but to accept truth and wisdom wherever it is presented and from whom ever
 that's the first question
it doesn't make sense to get wisdom from other teachers he's giving a couple examples are Muji is that the wise approach is that for me to the same exact answer and it was a it was the same thing I was a young Brahma Cherry I had a book
 that was not part of improv pods books and it was like forbidden even my book was forbidden by some people buy some you know your hunger devotees when I was young when I was young I wrote a book a Q&A a book with shut your eyes Prabhu and it got from it and you got to pick up and in certain places what did you say the interesting thing is the book made a bunch of people to vote he's so it's sort of like they just felt like for whatever reason it was not authorised at that time and I was always sort of pushing I'm always I'm always just weren't pushing the limits of
that leash I'm trying to snap that leash so it's the same thing can we take other thing things in your off the leash now you want to do whatever you want do whatever you want just don't wander into the road there's a reason why there is a leash there is a reason why there's people saying it was a reason why people are conservative it's not all because they're just trying to control you at the same time there's a there is also you know we don't want to be smothered as well so I think it was when the sages there's a beautiful healthy balance in our community and I just want that's what I wanted to say from that unorthodox TV show we are Tethered to the tradition
 yeah we we express box in new ways and we have a type of freedom and in that freedom we remain tether tether to our disciplines it if I find a great way to be my love where we're at actually with this
they're back sometimes we get people who just sort of wander into our Zoom group and they are Tethered to a very tight leash and you could pick up everything on the message board that they're saying and I was just like where did this guy come from you know what I mean it hasn't been long enough of our community we invite on the podcast cuz our community is it is like that tethered but there's like a call so we can flap her wings a little bit
 you actually
 you and I along with Linda Linda Linda we're just establishing clarifying getting down on paper for was in the stage of what our core values yeah and we borrowed
people from the Barclays Center which I was kind of involved in helping develop those but I think we all thought that Day translated over to what we're doing very nicely into those core values I think we would want one of them yesterday right or was that a yeah I feel will be right
 but I don't know what that was one of the core values okay here's the other two yesterday we had about focus on the essence
 and then the other two or one is called firmly rooted and the others called branching out right so firmly rooted it means firmly rooted with faith and loyalty to the Bounty tradition of Sri chaitanya at Staton exemplified by Chula Pro pod we can talk a lot about the very fundamentally it's saying we want what we share on this podcast in what in what we share through was in the sages whether it's this age groups or any other kind of
 anything that's part of wisdom of the ages
got to be firmly rooted in that tradition in and actually we we see Sheila property as uniquely important figure in all of this in the way that he presented both you were following in his footsteps and so we're careful we want to be careful that will represent in is authentic and in growing from coming through that and then. But the other side is branching out
 that's real culture of inclusion seeing every soul is important Christian service and reaching out with non-judgmental compassion and thoughtfulness to make the message about the relevant and accessible so I think the example you just maybe something pops up on our chat board in there maybe they got that firmly rooted but not the branching out Moody body the the core values that are part of this community and its skin and can stand out like a sore thumb like right off the bat
 tour now for me to get right into this question it
the really interesting question
 there's a couple ways that I would approach his first I would say this one part of it begins with trying to understand
 who were talking about right because if this if it's a person that's come to a certain level of commitment
 and they say I want to be practicing Gowdy bison of a as a follower of Sheila prophet in the in the six goswami to bring David excetera excetera if they made that commitment right if they've clarified that much then I would speak to that person in a different way than I was speak to a person that hasn't come to that conclusion
 like in until a person said that's what I want then it would be it might be a bit of an imposition to say that that's how you should be focused but if you already, said I want two practices and then and I can tell you that hearing from these other people you isn't is likely not going to help
very much
 could be confusing it could have been confusing in relation to that
 for that person I would too I would have likely approach like this I would say
 I want you to be able to make up your own mind about these things I want you to come to a level where you can you you can apply your own well-informed discernment to these kind of questions
 but I would also say but let's get you but in the way that I approach these things as I do have that face
 ensure the proper height and what he taught
 that when I approached those questions I want to see through the lens of his teachings
 and so that's if if this is a tradition that you also would like to practice in then what I would suggest as you kept well-informed read the entire jug of Akita and all the commentaries but she'll probably the issue involved with time sheet any charge in retail
and after devotion let's say that is a minimum right read it question it with people that have a deep understanding in it and that you were suspect it's that to you seem to embody at all well get your questions answered get your understanding clear now take your your own discernment now you're well informed on his discernment and see about these different teachers and if you feel that there's Aspire anything inspiring coming from it now if it's someone that's just coming in straight off the street they don't they haven't even come close to that, then I would approach it in a different way so that's one thing now the other thing is this
 when I look at it through the lens that I look at it through through the lens of Bucky as a stock I should have called but I have to stop by the ghost of armies and bring David has it stopped by shoot your tongue out
 I can look at some of these popular quote on quote glue figures
and some of them I see as that person is articulating a very well
 they done to the teachings of a Dunta and even in a way that is helpful in inharmonious and and I'm at and I may pick up things from them that I think are helpful
 particulate they're not antagonistic to the essence of bhakti like another was it and there's there's certain people certain of those teachers that I would say that person is not a faker that person is I'll give you three names out of the bat okay he's our people that they have conclusions that are different from our charges but I see that they're genuine and they're not fake it one is old school
 which is a shivananda
 play yes or no I'm astonished you been under yes
yes or no I think he can do you know I read a lot of books on Sheba Nunda and he goes back and forth it seems as a as a person with an impersonal I like his books I like his readings so I know he's not coming with people okay yeah sure yeah I agree I agree I trust his integrity and a sister of the guys are really good communicator and he's he's genuine he's he's practicing this in his life he's got some really good realization saint-andre Dunta and he knows how to communicate those in a way that's that's really understandable for people definitely an empowered teacher
 and it was some deep relaxation yeah I don't see him as having
full understanding of of bhakti
 that comes do you know who threw the go Swami's in through probably I don't see him that I did so there's definitely difference is there but I see him as a genuine person a genuine teacher some of this got some some clear realizations of bucking communicate very well I would say the same thing but never tole you know what like if I read his books I'm not it's not someone bluffing is not someone just throwing out there's other guys in their name names for scuba is that stuff makes me sick to my core it's like it's it's actually you know what if you want to write your own book about your own ideas about life go for it but if you want to pose as if you're some kind of representative of the authentic you know
 spiritual tradition that grows out of the sacred text Mindy that you don't leave him alone you know just leave a grade.
a lot of those people I would say maybe a lot of them a lot of the big popular ones to me it's not hearing from them is not only not helpful it's actually destructive you know it's like it's it's real it's it's real crummy stuff that they're putting out there in the guise of being some kind of lighting teach little I didn't I mean that being said they might just say something that that of truth and you can be like oh yeah I need to use the euro path but yeah it can be at kick you off the train tracks as well if you are someone that listens to his podcast on a daily basis and see you know what you regularly and you're feeling inspired by you say I would like to practice about to yoga in the way that these people practice that I would suggest as I said earlier read Bhagavad Gita as it is
Richmond Baba Tom Rich attorney charge and Rita Reed natural lotion you can do that in a year if you if you're focused right you could read all of that in a year year-and-a-half something like that tall order a bit of a tall order but two years write two years in in in right down your questions and seek out the answers to them and see if you can find good consistent clear inspiring answers from people
 and after that year and a half or two years then you're going to be more well-informed to be able to to see where you find truth and wear some was just bluffing you know that's a great point I mean read these books even if you're not one hundred percent sure but you fill out the grand there's some truth there I'm going to go further read it and buy it as much as you can because I'll tell you this really studying the shipment back but I'm in but you will develop the discernment that when you hear a guru speed
someone is claiming to be a guru or their followers claim them that he is enlightened being youl be able to say nonsense or maybe you'll just really we go into it later like hearing from you know thought leaders and people were supposed to be enlightened we don't like there's no. There's no metric or is he lying does he like this got these people say stuff and other you know let's more than anything will give you a discernment of what is he teaching isn't an authorized teaching representing big of a culture is a guy just talking about there's also very smart people which you could apply things I say to life but you know that Surly Enlighten people but they are more enlightened than you are perhaps you know but the vomiting will give you that way to measure
 where's this guy coming from
what is Lady coming from or they just making this stuff up yeah they just making it up a lot. Make another wish their own kind of lure of their moment of Enlightenment when that happened or you know when I choose to leave my body I will show you all that and I think they're getting all this kind of crap right I'm looking I'm looking for person that sang that's not even trying to show me that there quote unquote enlightened what they're trying to do is say I'm representing a tradition and I'm trying to make it understandable for you and if if and I'm not in special when you get here she'll probably be you say I'm just a servant here right now I'm just trying to adjust do my part to take what's been handed to me and hand it to the next person and you know that it is that's my rule I'm not posing as some kind of
 special. Had all these special mystical experiences and so how am I going to measure that how am I going to know that
tell me the first thing that the phone is going to do right as have their own kind of little history and the person that's really got that is likely not going to even be talking about but that's not the essence and it's not going to help anyone was going to help someone is to really understand these teachings clearly
 incidentally focus on that
 all right as soon as someone starts giving me their spiritual bio of why they are in they are very exalted place I start to wonder what generally the great souls and not just like our Guru CarGurus go to bed when you redo the tradition that these characters of The Bog of town they're not trying to you know they're not trying to like flatter themselves to impress us there like their impressive by their their humility and their behavior and the desire to give instead of to be the center of everything that's what was so impressive when I first came to the ashram it was not about the spa
it was about the speakers appreciation of the guru of the previous masters of the grade science etcetera I was like oh I get it this is a tradition there following a tradition here it's not just one Cult of Personality sky with all that interesting insight there again there's very insightful interesting charismatic people but this is not necessarily that I met people who study our tradition were Tethered to the tradition that are not charismatic but not at all that intelligent but they actually have but they actually can give some truth genuine truth and they have no ego about them and and it shines through
 intelligence and charm or secondary to this stuff
 okay
 are those good one at a time here at 8:53
one second one that you had had second part of the question right yeah he says one other question what are your recommendations for devotee who lives too far from a temple yet just had has a small kirtan study group unsure of finding a spiritual teacher maybe initiation someday excetera
 I think it's doing everything perfect or she's doing everything perfect that's exactly what you got to do every little kirtan study group and guess what that's what you're doing it it's one of those things like what do I do about this you're doing it if people come over here and Shan together and you try to keep a you try to raise the bar with the people it sounds like this person is also concerned about finding their Guru or their spiritual teacher Cyril, you go to come quick there is there is no obstacle ultimately
if you're sincere as you're going to do you will find that person you know this is something that Linda Linda Linda and organized and I were all meeting together about it where it will feel fortunate to have her getting involved in helping us pull some things together and manage our things cuz we're going out tonight there's like a lot of resources out there but but we we've been meaning for a long time to provide a lot more support for a listener's we've got to save groups and that's a great way to go you can really get some nice Community their connect with some good people maybe even get a bit of mentorship have a place where you can share your thoughts in your ideas Sage boobs are great way to do that but we also wanted to grab the sage Academy where you can really study everything you need to study bringing lots of really good teachers are people that we really trust to do it well or not just philosophy although that's really important but learn culture learn ritual learn cooking
whatever all the things that we were given when we moved into our shrums you want to provide for people on line dance dance yeah sure come on partner in custody by chin mudra
 so soon in case we hope to be able to provide you a lot more of that kind of support hopefully in the near future so keep your eyes open for that chat it's a cultural conquest of the cultural Revival II deeper on my way down here today did these classes by radhika Ramon that you recommended, show me my block of a Time on YouTube
the of the shoe mud bog with time part 1 and part 2
 and I'm just like man I got to get dive deeper into the culture like if I understood Sanskrit I have so much more
 appreciation for the baggage from I feel really draws you in there
 and I asked him if that's already cooked I asked him straight off my first question I said just tell us the truth how much are we missing out on by not knowing Sanskrit when we read these texts were feeling inspired get so much from it but how much are we missing out on you said well I'm sorry to tell you you are missing out on a lot so much in terms of mean exactly but in terms of the beauty of it the Poetry of it the suppose you are a lot of that we're missing
if you don't know this answer that's part of what I enjoyed about those in those trucks he was defining it begins or talks to go to the Sherman bar with him by the finding how the bug time is so unique even in terms of all the different piranhas in terms of a fracture in terms of its language in terms of its ideological thrust is Clarity you know who sang it most of the promise it kind of our like a loose kind of collection of different stories with different messages sometimes you can see me to contradict each other places when you get to the bar with Tom first of all is presented in a far more sophisticated mature a well-developed in difficulty level of Sanskrit and he was saying that when your learning skills faster when you're just a beginner
 you kind of get trained by studying versus from the mob bar to the piranhas
but your test
 is Sherman Bobby time you know if you can understand comprehend you know communicate on that you know towards that level so it's it's it's some there's so much there that unique and he really in those stalks you really kind of lazy. Then you got to attend you got a better do you say call I get it yesterday was like collecting all these different stores and they all had valuable but they were difficult to discern what's the point here then he composed this super piranha right that that's like it was a mass to work cuz we was his super master work you know what terms of its poetry and it turns to the clarity of his message in terms of how you just he said he presented it more like a PhD dissertation when you get to buy what time is like a well-reasoned clear argument that's being presented where you might have a hard time to start earning that from although any
you know by knowing the language also he was saying like how the ask himself said you know all these other great works that are important in viticulture they're practically despicable compared to this day there they're practically despicable use that word that we wouldn't pick up unnecessarily unless you understood the Sanskrit
