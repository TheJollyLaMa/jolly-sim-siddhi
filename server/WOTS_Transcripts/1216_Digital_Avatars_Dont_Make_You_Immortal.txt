message boards and make a stupid maybe we are connected member twins in a previous life
 maybe we were the maybe we were the famous Imes twins
 in the Guinness Book World Record yeah I'm sure there were many other but they sort of like
 well we were both alive when they were alive so I doubt that no original Siamese twins
 backwards when Tyler was called Siam it was like a whole nother time by the way did use the word Siam comes from Sean
 no I did not know that yep, Brahma
 admitting you dropping all kinds of things are ready we just wait where are the guy who starred in who's the biggest fish in the world
Cambodia Chang bunker and Eng bunker May 11th 1811
 I had to go back
 okay I guess they both were born cuz they were twins but they died I think I'm the same day too but they were Siamese Thai to share the same body can conjoined twins brothers whose Fame propelled the expression siamese twins to become synonymous for conjoined twins in general there why they exhibited as Curiosities and were two of the nineteenth Century's most studied human beings
 we could be there about Siamese cats
 you and me could be the incarnations of the view that we could we do a lot but we think a lot together we are born the same month and you know what I mean
 for the cause of all for the cause of death was it says that one of them died from a cerebral blood clot
and the other one died of fright
 that would be scary for head right next to you dies and you're stuck with it
 that we could have conjoined twins listening right now
 it was just like sitting right there sitting next to each other
 okay right now they fathered 21 children who are them what they like celebrities back then but still
 that's so awesome. I guess they were Curiosity on more than just the you know like how are you have two heads
 they could have also been very discharging they seem Charming from the photo local sisters
 RH
still related to them probably
 who could be listening to the show who could feasibly wheels that you have people from Thailand listeners they could be listen to me if you are from the dynasty The Offspring over the news again and Chang and Eng bunker if you come from them and you listen to the show right in and let us know what you think of like
 you know Lori nickens onto had children bhaktisiddhanta had
 the descendants of these acharya is her around somewhere

 so we're moving today at 1 to 2 and 9 p.m. eastern time and even though I said last call People's Health trickling in and I'm calling the governor on eco Village we need one more space we need one more bed if you're if you're thinking about any of those trainings or the wisdom trading I know it's late in the day it's December 18th people you got to figure this out right away please call us cuz I have to close this they want to know so I'm going to wisma stages.com or wisdom training looks wonderful and they were all geared up for my poor Barry very my conscious I'm happy to see you there we're going to be sitting right next to you just like the bunker twins take some photos only get like a curtain made that like fix us both and sent him a few next
I don't eat except you and me will be like the two argumentative with twins you know what what I did you know what I had today we're going to that I thought we got to bring this for the people and they come to my poor what I had for first time in a long time Jackfruit sub g o that's really sweet, we don't Merrick has just caught on to Jack Byrne West right now your chef jacket since Wednesday night when we first went to India they would eat I guess that you is that it I would imagine it's got like a media that younger green Jackfruit it's a media media texts to us it's like you're having this vegetable dish in this like his picture it's almost like someone just took a
chunga artichoke or something and threw it in there but a chewy and it's really good so nice I love Jackfruit subject and Jackfruit fruit ripe in the chirp that's where they get the flavor of Juicy Fruit gum did you know that
 no I didn't thank you that's Juicy Fruit gum next time you eat if you like fresh Jackfruit I'm not crazy about it but they're in the fascinating and they were so yeah you got a lot of Subs you with one of those things a lot of subjects of course in my poor there's bail for it which is quite wonderful to make a nice juicy yeah Harden balls and grind them down into a pulp it's delicious what other my poor fools than theirs date palm date palm candy that's incredible you looking to date date date palm trees and indeed they have these
hanging underneath it in the same way we tap maple trees and they tap the date palm trees it's going to go out with that date palm Russ Evans if you can drink it but you have to drink early in the morning or ferments really quickly and then look out in toxic in the date what are there good my poor kitties are there out there
 banana flour banana flour
 right there then when they make like a tornado mango sabzi
 you know who made it okay if you're still interested and misty misty dies their famous you take yogurt and you hang it and then it drips all the excess water out to the water shrikant
I thought Misty. He was that was hung to Mara is if this text or similar regular yogurt but it's got its sweet and it's so sweet and it's like it's really yes I thought it was okay forget that I thought I knew that when we move on we have a really call it a nugget is that I could have books are you reading I was I was talking to my wife and she's in England and she grew up issue mode she really grew up in Sri Lanka B when she was in her late teens she spent time in her home in England and I think she would go there in the summer sometimes when she was a little girl
 so she has some friends from there and
her friends were and she meets up with them
 and they were telling her that the big thing in England right now so I guess shoes thing is this you know the band ABBA is great they are eating the band Abba they just released a thing in England
 where they filmed it's like it takes they take 25 camera angles simultaneously shining down on a stage
 to create like one figure of a 3d figure of a person in Abba on the stage and so they say they they make a car not going to have a concert come alive on the stage and they say that it is so realistic that you cannot tell that it's not real and at the end 3D images 3D images and at the end
the concert then the real Abba people come out and they're all nobody's really sure if they're real or not because it's just that realistic and people going crazy over the mega millions and millions of dollars and so my my wife is tell me about this since you said you should do this with you two today instead of me getting up I can we have a younger version of me well that's what's happening here cuz it would look what I brought you from the Smithsonian Magazine and it's about kiss kissed a vuse digital avatars that will keep the band quote on quote Forever Young and forever iconic I believe that's debatable, but I debated right now and you know what as you read this we can just try to think about what this means you know what it means about
 that they're going to sit so you know Gene Simmons and what's his name Peter Peter Frampton Chris Peters
Peter Stanley can I think of their names because all their names are both first and last name is Paul Stanley also yes okay here it is Peter Criss Peter Criss Ace Frehley
 Ace report I hear we're going to hear from her like all Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons
 okay watching The Rock okay this is from the Smithsonian Magazine its debut use digital avatars that will keep the band young and forever iconic the rock band is the first in the US to immortalize his performance with a digital Recreation Recreation on Saturday the members of the rock band KISS concluded the final show of their farewell tour with the big reveal after leaving the stage each band member was replaced the
digital Avatar who proceeded to perform the song God Gave Rock and Roll to You by Kiss a crocodile as the Guardians Michael son rights as a newspaper
 they use their Encore to debut their afterlife
 4 years since the start of their farewell tour and over 20 years since their original farewell tour Gene Simmons Paul Stanley Eric singer I guess that's a new guy and Tommy Thayer also a new guy walked off the stage at Madison Square Garden to make argue with each other
 yeah that was probably mess of lawsuits going on who owns the name okay to make room for four versions of their younger selves
demon the CR child
 Catman and Spaceman this holographic Rapture as Bert Helm of Fast Company calls it makes kiss the first American band to recreate itself digitally what we've accomplished has been amazing but it's not enough congratulations the band deserve to live on because the band is bigger than we are to Stanley in a video is exciting for us to go the next step and see piss immortalize anything anything to beat Death motion capture technology are the work of a collaborate collaborator in between industrial Light & Magic George Lucas
special effects company in Swedish conglomerate hophouse entertainment this wasn't the two companies first B Rodeo they previously partnered to create the virtual album Voyage show in London which was performed by the band digital avatars and made over 2 million dollars a week
 this could have a concert in three cities in the same night across 3 different continents
 or Sunday and CEO of Pop House Entertainment tells the AP that's what you could do with this I mean just just to slow down just for a second here
 basically you're saying is we can show a movie of kiss and three different cities at the same time is it doesn't that just blow your mind it's like all worked up about something that's just basically the movie right now. I wonder if you could do it with you today because you could have like the stage diving
disappears
 could part of like the hardcore thing is pissing me off.
 What may be looking to get a part only worked yet to stage-diving where no one gets hurt he say this back to cbgb's
 now listen to read the next okay now now we can be forever young and forever iconic by taking us to places we've never dreamed up before says Simmons in the video Stanley says he's sometimes asked when the band will stop his response the band will never stop because we don't own the band the fans on the band The World owns the band A really do I own the panels can I have the percentage that but you know and then I saw the video set a 2-minute video kind of advertising thing in like it opens
Paul Stanley so I think he's he's saying to the audience you are loved your power has made us Immortal in our psyche know what's going on here you're not Immortal you're not God but you know you can see like it you stand up on that stage and have enough people like screaming and you begin to think you really spent you know like like when they sing a song by God gave you rock and roll I think they really think they're the gods are hurting and I think like to love you know the worship of their fans and somehow making them Immortal but they're probably I don't know I think they might be not sure what I was thinking I thought a few things about this may be powerful rakshasas to take birth but I don't know it could be all an act that bit me and they were real life part of yours womanizer is etcetera
maybe they can maybe they only do that when they're in their twenties I'm not hit here's my point and it goes
 just one as this technology develops
 people are so quick
 I'm just speaking ways it's not so neatly into what you could call like demonic illusion will end by that what I mean by that is theirs send centrifical force and centripetal force right there spinning away from reality it which kind of like it means increasing my illusion about who I am now I'm independent, I'm not dependent on anything or anyone and when you get to kiss levels like I am in more tolerance is like we're reading the Mahabharata right now write the whole thing starts with like the demons the asuras saying we we figured it out
call Vishnu cell power of why is more powerful than you because all these brahmins are doing this more less worship right there doing this job news on behalf of Lord Vishnu he's getting power from that and all we need to do is destroy the brahmins destroy the brahmins stop that you have now and then Vision will become powerless it's there they're almost thinking like in a similar you know like you your love your power has made us Immortal you know it's right ahead and then he said the 16th chapter the body of a get a divorce and then he says you know he said that I think was posting this in the future or maybe in the future so exciting we can live on eternally know what's going to happen is like just a relatively short number of years down the road people going to be like people actually end of this crap pick me up at 4. I'm interested
I'd like to look at me I'm on the cover of this record this is the thing like that what happens when new technology comes out as
 quick how quickly people and say like ascentra they're using demonic language like I sent you the same we have transcended the laws of nature and entered into eternity as I know you haven't you are entirely bound you're you're in a very deep illusion and the fact that there's a machine now that can make it look like you're standing there needs nothing zero NADA you know my second thought was how poorly we choose to use this technology because our our send are sent or centrifugal force spinning away from the center you know we say all we could use this to make a thing with kiss it's like they're not even thinking alike let's do Bob Dylan
me to get on kiss to too hard you know that they are what they are but they're not exactly don't they didn't bring a lot for the intellect was kind of like you know where is like you could actually use that Tech will you bring back
 can you do me a liberated song walk in the planet in modern times and then keep them forever if they have this one probably
 yeah and you know what life is like in a technology and use it in a great way exactly it in but we we just use it in the dumbest way right off the bat you know because we could because we have you know what it made me think of is how in the
 it's in the bag of time then simple it up yeah I got this is from the 10th cancer the bag with some words it's a chapter that's
it's a 20th chapter of the 10th can fish in a bog time I think that's where this phone it's only spoke about their this may be a different place but he uses the the
 it talks about was called the audio te the glowworm you know in the evening
 in the evening Twilight
 during the rainy season
 the darkness allowed
 the glowworms but not the Stars to shine forth just as in the age of Kali the predominance of a dharmik activities allows adamic doctrines to overshadow the true knowledge of the betas right so it's like it's saying that that great quote Yeah so so so it's like in this in a glow worm is like someone that's got a little bit of a glow to It On Fire Fly by fireflies
 Firefly maybe not exactly worm
but you know it's got a little bit of glow to it and it's particularly they're saying the Autumn season right when it's cloudy cuz Autumn season is Reign you know it's the time of the rainy season and so when you know it's cloudy you're not getting the moon like you're not getting the Starlight so little glow worm is kind of like you can see it really distinctly is like oh wow look at that worm is glowing it's just but you know if the moon is out what speak of the Sun
 what are glow worms got nothing is got nothing you know and and and I think when we think of a lot of these entertainers and they're distracting you know what they seem like all their big deal but it's just because there's no real knowledge you know that that's that's we have to end in the popular culture work we're just not so attractive we haven't been trained with a with healthy values you know like values that are you old
that would make us attracted to other things and other people so we got this technology like let's do a thing with kiss you know another thing I was thinking is you know a lot of people that listen to a podcast are very very successful in the workplace summer famous summer and if you cultivate spiritual knowledge with success you realize my success is so puny that's how it happens you really having success it's all a gift what can I do with this success but we had the focus gets taken off of ourselves and put on to put into God ultimately and then you have people in the material world where the Eagles sang You're successful you're the best you're number one and to the degree that they're materialistic I won't even say Krishna conscious just like really materialistic they're desperately trying to hold on to that and prove to the world see I am successful this is what I am and look we're going now the biggest illusion of the mom or more here's another
example of Good Karma ruining your life check it out you have made us Immortal you're not even speak that deal right now Immortal and they're getting age spots on their faces and hands and their teeth are falling out like it must be like this is the illusion of the material world is that we're feeling ourselves like what is so something's wrong I feel famous I feel successful I've got everything I need I presented myself to the world in one sense as I got all my act together but deep down I realize this is a costume I'm wearing
 and I really don't want people to find out what I actually am which is Emma I'm weak I'm here val'able I'm fragile and vulnerable you know I've got a pendant I got irritable bowel syndrome
call her abilities in boxing we start off with them I am the most ball and you know we start off of this like incredible truth palpable soldiers in this world falling down breaking temporary existence you know it's kind of like we talked about the dream was in the dream but like a like a band like kiss his kind of like a Dream Within A Dream Within a dream you know cuz it wasn't even like they were normal band on stage they were like guys playing these these superhuman you didn't so most yes it but but but they weren't themselves
 they were they were revealed themselves eventually they are like the Dream Within the Dream Within the Dream Within A Dream is like now is not home. Like us in costume but it's
it's a virtual reality of us in costume it should work just like no truth to it no no reality to it too heavy on that but I'm just saying if we were happy and satisfied and found something meaningful and Troost like why not go there and ended in the irony is
 is actually that that get you in touch with your true immortality which is which is actually a fact but you just spinning so so so severely towards illusion that you're not even aware of the theft the possibilities that you have
 and everybody says hi too and just get further and further distracted from juice I'm going to think about this all day now
 yes
 but you know I was thinking you know I share them show. I wonder if they took when they took off their costumes everyone's
oh you look like that they were I said everybody was like damn I was thinking that you know I think I've shared on the show before
 you know sometimes seem like I want someone Mandrell I was here and never to eat where I am not a one-man drama where the actor was playing volcano topic or or one man drama where the actor was playing Chuggington on the pond at this great Saint from the bucket tradition and when he went and I know the actor but when he went into the role he became that he became that character and you felt like that character was right in front of you you know I'm saying that's just what a simple drama one person that that that focuses on a script that's developed that something so meaningful you know that that every word in the script
 Kerry's wait here has some deep
significance of deep personal spiritual significance and that person stands there and essentially it's the same thing right he's not showing up on it but he becomes it in a few few intensely feel like that's him so everyone says this isn't a big deal at all it's not you know it's really not anything different than a kiss not anything different than when they had beatlemania like when we were kids right they found four guys look just like him and it's really it's nothing exciting to talk about it like now we're going to the mortality of a man yeah but but it can be sewing again whether it's drama or whether it's this 3D technology is not good or bad this is a question how you use it what you doing thank you kaszuba who they sent you that in the new Maya pour
 yeah that's what I was thinking it would be so cool right
to like the the sage is gathered in my name is sharanya ahead of the game sometimes I feel like we're behind the game could take that but you don't like Indians they're really into like dioramas ever notice that very simple American American kids like what the heck is going on
 anyway this this could go the next week in tech Next Generation like 3D dioramas going on in each little box you go by we've got such good stories Danica Sora. Imagine like a greedy thing of the trees like these all these animals a giant snake looks like a snake opens its mouth to the 3D snake mouth and you like you want to touch you but you can
it's not real and this could be good grandfather B's my on my bed of arrows
 yeah I would love to see all those
 so many good ones
 okay what about you in there what would what would marry want to see come on I can think of a million more shifts you pop the coward boys like when they're all playing around and like tossing Christmas lunch in like you know after we got two elderly go pee and recognizing account
 all right
 that's my dream pestova that's my dream these 3D
Geisha House
 but the work we don't Chop Hockey where they have all the dioramas now it's going to be all like 3D things that you can feel like you could touch them really cool can happen that you know cuz you know how do you know how things like you know when we were young there like ladies and gentlemen children we've got something into the teacher would bring in the same like I've got something I want to show you it's going to change things forever he pulled out his gigantic thing the size of a cash register their like it's going to Texas Instruments calculator
 $900 but you know now everything your phone has a calculator in it so I'm just saying technology gets so they start over these prototypes that are really expensive and a touch everything this is everyone a snake is going to eat a little boy looks like
and you know she'll take the snakes brap exactly a little donkey is going to get thrown into a tree there's a little fruits you could practically whole off and eat you know another thing that I thought about this one is just like okay so now you got the 3D show going on so you can see kiss anytime anywhere they could be playing in three different cities in the same night okay
 well that's great now I don't what if we just did this what if every band just did this Rosen tour
 it's better than that you know that it's kind of gets old as if it's better than the real thing right or what what if they just what we just downloaded this like we did Netflix and I could just see it in my house
 well then the whole class and they will what if we can make it so that I'm sitting in the middle of the crowd hearing you know this and it just gets to the point where
what do you do with your life and I want to let you know I just keep us indoors like you never have to leave your little cubicle sir I'm curious when they started having Netflix and people started getting big TVs did that make movie sales a better go down
 yeah and put but not I put on song about the human element you know like yeah I get it you know like you and I grew up going to going to like small you know hardcore concerts and there was something to that to that even though it was like it was like inside your degrading people you had to get an all kind of crazy situations you have learned you have some Backbone in life if you know you know what I'm saying you had to go out and do something it's like what are we going to do just sitting here thinking this is a good thing
 we're just going to come miserable
so safer
 I got a virtually beat up today at the hardcore show
 let's start running around your living room
 I could go on with us forever let's get at the bottom of time
 thanks for that cuz yeah right on the message that I'm driving to send it to me the area before starting my baggage I'm witches are very means of Conquest Wichita prospective obeisance is who is supreme Lord Narayan human being that's the price of operation in Schaumburg
glasses in the Bog to Tom and by rendering service a devotees all it is troublesome to Hart become eradicated and loving service the Supreme Lord who is praised with Transit at the songs will be established as in a revocable fact open my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer my basins he's at their Lotus feet
 refinish email Bobby Tom Canto 6 chapter 16 text 21
 21 x 21 and mind of the condition Soul cannot approach the Supreme person. Let's let's remind ourselves what's going on here this is the meditation Munch Munch has versus meditation that Nardo gave to
 change it to K2
now that he's been cracked open by the death of his son and then his son came back and he gave him all these instructions about the attachment and now in that state in order to hear let me plant this seed in you let me give you this meditation on Lord Vishnu and you Chances with you know with deep attention and devotion for 7 days and then you're going to see Lord Vishnu himself so greases the verses
 but the real lord there's no not like a 3D the words in mind of the condition Soul cannot approach the Supreme personality of godhead or material names and forms are not applicable to the Lord who is entirely spiritual beyond the conception of gross and subtle forms the impersonal Ramon is another of his forms may he live by his pleasure
as pots made completely of Earth are situated on Earth after being created and are transformed into Earth again when broken this Cosmic manifestation is caused by the Supreme Vermont situated in the Supreme Ramon and annihilated in the Supreme Vermont therefore since the Supreme Lord is the cause of Vermont let us offer him a respectful obeisances is a great example like here and here you see this too cuz so many of the the pots cups that people use one time or like one use bright sun do you need cops can we stop glaze or anything like that it's just the simplest mud you know Clay turned into a thing dried-out you use it you throw back in a very quickly becomes part of the Earth again
 right and so it's just saying that everything in this world is just like that right it's made of of of the stuff it manifest for some time
emerges right back into its Cycles I want to think my body is so important just what a clay isn't it this is clay
 we're just claim an thank you stream Vermont emanates from the Supreme personality of God had an expanse like the sky although Untouched by anyting materials it exists within and without going to last the Mind intelligence and senses and living force can either touch him nor know him I offer unto him respectful obeisances this is 9 chapter bug of agita you know the Christians at the sky and everything's moving and within him but he's on he's on mood he's everything is in the sky in the skies in everything and went that's your space you know what the sky remains even though so many things are changing and shifting scar Remains the Same
and so Christian saying I'm like that everything is in me and I'm in everything but I'm aloof it doesn't have nothing affects me you know what I had to I had a wonderful experience this morning brother. Yeah, I just read in Night chapter but I was reading it from a certain point of view that I never done so intentionally before and just clicked every single first made perfect sense for me know
 you know how is Keith is like that you know it's like you can just reveal more and more anytime you know yeah and it's it's it was I'm really looking forward to doing this keto that were talking about yesterday oh good yeah
 as iron has the power to burn when made red hot in the association of fire so the body senses living Forest mind and intelligence although merely lumps of matter can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness
what is spring personality of godhead as iron cannot burn unless heated by fire the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Rimowa is iron can I burp is kind of like iron cold iron bar has no ability to burn
 but you heat it up sufficiently and it's like it's like fire itself burn anything it touches it simply the material energy and it has no animation but by the touch of Spirit by the touch of the Superior Energy of of Krishna if it's alive is anything that is alive you know the body piercing entirely life just is iron a is fire
 oh transcendental Lord so these are the prayers or the mantras that are given given up to see chitra K to to help him see the Lord face-to-face yes you just the English translations of those moms
correct IO Transcendent Lord who are situated in the topmost planet of the spiritual World your to Lotus feet are always massage by a multitude of the best devotees with their Lotus Bud hands are soft you are the Supreme personality died had complete and six opulence is you are the screen person mentioned in the Peru shook the prayers when was perfect self realize masterball Mystic Powers let me offer my respects to the Basin so used to you send a ship to prayers are from the date as the ancient
 prayers glorifying Lord Vishnu as the source of everything in the universe
 Tri-City Craigslist, continued
 Narda having become the spiritual Master teacher K2 instructed him fully in this prayer because chitra K2 is fully surrendered okay Cricket Narda then left with the Great Sage John Gira for the topmost planet known as
Brahma Loca can't hear his kingship Decatur the guys got everything except the Suns we've got some material issues he's got a deal with before he could be fully Transit dental and this whole thing about came back he's just got a little Karma to burn you see that you just tell her just a little less than left you know and then they're liberated let me see people like a lot of lessons to learn you know but this is King t'chaka Cajun this is all we need it he needed to go through that experience as tragic as it was and revealing as it was and now he's a whole different person you think is about to see Lord Vishnu face to face
 what is your lesson go stupid
plus he has to work but your Mall everyone just get it over with tell me okay fasting and drinking only water should your k241 week continuously chanted with great care and attention the Mantra given by Nardo Mooney
 can Cricket after only one week of repeatedly practice in the Mantra receive from the spiritual Master teacher Katie to achieve the rule of the Planet of the video Doris as an intermediate product to be spiritual basement in knowledge so he got some from him like he became qualified in some way that is like here you take care of this now right sometimes when you become qualified to get more responsibility
 they're after within a very few days by the influential Mantra that your case with practiced his mind became increasingly
enlightened in spiritual progress and he attained shelter at the Lotus feet of a nun to Dave upon reaching the shelter the Supreme personality. Head should you get your cat you saw that he was as white as a white fibers of the lotus he was dressed in blue ash garments and adorned with a brilliantly glittering helmet armed with spelt and bangles he wants or or or an unto us is a form of Lord Vishnu here I know but I'm saying he was dressed like that or not he was dressed like this and like that okay
 his face was smiling and his eyes were reddish he was surrounded by such an exalted liberated persons as sanat kumara this is what we should be seeing the 3D presentation of us let's see this this is beautiful you know when men when men dress up like this they look like Liana liberato it looks sort of crazy but when Lord Vishnu looks like this it's like
take a look like Liberace Liberace if you're young enough we don't remember and it's almost worth Google searching Liberace right now
 interesting character Liberace was mounted men very talented very very talented
 as soon as I can I'm going to post them on one of my stories in the garage you video and post it
 as soon as Maharashtra case you saw the Supreme Lord he was cleansed of all material contamination and situated in his original Krishna Consciousness being completely purify so if you burned it all the way now sometimes you can get these things that are so-called tragedies like this say you have a computer and it's just like
riddled with viruses and what do they call that now we're malware and you're just hopeless you just like I can't use this thing at all it's like every time I try to click on something weird things to start happening it is and then some of his will let me help you with that and then they come in and they got all this kind of antivirus technology in the running all these different programs and if they're clearing it in the clearing of the clip and tell us like right back that it just does exactly what you wanted to do you know this is like matcha cake to his head was full of attachments which are basically you know corrupted files in the mind about the files and sometimes we have this the empowerment of a manager who say manager of White Zombie and he was very cool guy but I remember him
like to slow breakdown because I haven't and he just like a lost it and went in his Manhattan you ran into the window and through the entire thing up and window and then you get a new computer this is the material world corrupted files error error messages but you know it was the experiences of the death of his son the instructions of the sages then the instructions of his son come back to life and now this meditation on Lord Vishnu and then when he finally saw the note that was like the last that just burned the last corrupt file you know erase the last corrupt file on his on his computer of his mind and how did it freeze it again
 he became silent grave tears tears what says he was cleansed of all material contamination is situated in his original Krishna Consciousness there was no
there's no filter you know that was warping his understanding of Truth in that truth LED right to to Lord Vishnu he's in that you can completely purify did you read the rest of the verse is nice
 he became silent silent and Grave and because of love for the Lord tears fell from his eyes and his hair stood on end okay let's book Goosebumps I get it I get it but what it's saying now is that now that his mind
 was no longer in any way problematic was no longer program with false ideas his mind was completely in harmony
 with himself right with the nature of his true soul and and now there's nothing to block nothing to interfere with feeling the love of God towards him and
feeling love for God
 directed towards to him and in that state you begin to feel the deepest spiritual ecstasy and that's manifesting through involuntary systems symptoms like tears falling from his eyes and goosebumps
 he's got he's got a rush of like just spiritual feelings and emotions like just just running like through his body like electricity at this point
