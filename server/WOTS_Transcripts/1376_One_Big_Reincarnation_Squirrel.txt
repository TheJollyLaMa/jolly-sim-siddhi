double picture people here of many cases reincarnation these days but in the early thirties information about a girl born in a little-known locality in Delhi
 who claimed to remember past life was considered great news indeed
 the girl at first was known only to the local people but gradually news of her spread all over the country and finally all over the world it was natural that they that the world should wonder about the authenticity of the story already was born in 1926 she was the subject of speculation all her life in 1985 questions or even raised about her existence in a special issue on reincarnation in a prominent weekly English Journal of India visit good luck good luck with this one more real except for this real I accept this.
not everything that someone would raise such doubts without conducting a proper study in February of 1986 I had gone to Delhi to meet Ian Stevenson the leading expert in reincarnation research from the University of Virginia dr. Stevenson had already investigated a case so I showed him the article a few days later I met Shanti Devi and spent about an hour and a half with her later I interviewed many people connected with the case at Delhi matura Jaipur Jaipur and including Shanti Devi has relatives in this life and from her past life as Luda by relatives from this life and last life yeah he's doing both I also examined are we crazy

 and 7 days after Lucy's death on December 11th 1926 Volvo dormitor of cheer while I'm not a small locality in Delhi was blessed with a daughter whom they named Shanti Devi she was just like any other girl except that until the age of four she did not speak much
 but when she started talkin she was a different girl she talked about her cousin what different than she was before she wouldn't she should hardly spoke before then once you spell but once you started speaking the age of four she was talkin like if it was strange. She was she was difficult she she talked about her husband and her children
all these children they just make up these stories are imaginary friends they'll get over it just give them time that's what they thought at first she said that her husband was in the Torah
 where do you want to call shop and they had a son she called herself Chow Benet
 which means Chow B's wife the parents considered a child's fantasy and took no notice they got worried however when she talked repeatedly about and overtime narrated a number of incidents connected with her life of a tour with her husband out of the mouths of babes cuz tuba this is how many has one this is 25% of all reincarnation stories are from children from the ages of 4 and under on occasion at meal she would say in my house and make sure I a different kind of sweets sometimes when her mother was dressing her she would tell what type of dresses she used to wear she meant
three distinctive features about her husband he was fair I think. I don't really speak Patwa to pale complexion lighter skin lighter skin he was fair he had a big wart on his left cheek and he won't say that either he wore reading glasses she also mentioned that her husband's shop is located in front of the door katisha Temple
 by this time Shanti Devi was six years old and her parents were perplexed and worried by such statements the girl even gave a detailed account of her death following childbirth
 they consulted their family physician who is amazed how little girl girl narrated so many details of the complicated surgical procedures
 mystery the music they can remember them if there was some type of trauma in death is it here you go yeah the parents started thinking that these men out the mystery dust continue to deepen
parents started thinking that these memories might have been a past life
 As I Grew Older she persisted in asking her parents be taken to Matera
 she however never mentioned her husband's name up to the age of eight or nine it is customary in India that wives do not utter the name of their husbands right they call them that the economy economy activity even when specifically asked she would blush and say she would just said that she would recognize him if taken there but would not say his name to the kind of like what you're telling us to take it to your husband but you can't tell us his name I can't tell you his name I will not say it one day at a distant that one was okay thank you one day at a distant One Day At A Distant relation bubble brushing Chand
 a teacher in ramjas high school daryaganj in Delhi
Shanti Devi that if she told him her husband's name he would take her to a Torah
 Lord by the swapper she whispered into his ear the name pundit cater not chow mein
 I want to set a customer I appreciate the store but this I do know I'm not expecting this type of like squirrel from you my friend this is my time this is my gift to you with the love with which has offered this is something where I would hijack the show take there's some crazy direction and you would have to like real men like you're reeling in a great white shark I think this is important for people to hear
 okay so he said if you tell me his name so she told the name
 and then she whispered that name sounded cater not shall be launched and then told her that he would arrange for the Church of a tour after do in
okay let me look into it he wrote a letter to Punta Cana not y'all Bay detailing all the statements made by Shanti Devi and asked him to visit Deli kid or not replied confirming most of her statements and suggested that one of his relatives turned it on Jamal who lived in Delhi be allowed to meet this girl so he's got a relative there and he said let her let him meet her
 a meeting with konjima was arranged during which Shanti Devi recognized him as her husband's cousin
 she gave some details about her house and mature and informed him of the location where she had buried some money
 I know that would hurt you but I've heard other other narrations of his said that when that relative came he pretended that he was her husband and she said no no it's not you
 your distant relative
when asked whether she could go by herself from the railway station to her house immature she replied in the affirmative if they would take her there Country Mall was so impressed that he went to Matt or to persuade you not to visit deli catering not came to Delhi so the husband's coming
 on November 12th 1935
 with Luke the son navneet Lawler to his present wife
 okay and his present wife you can't explain these things you just have to accept these things you can't they make no sense and what it does it breaks down our modern concept of even like Christianity like the Christians have to like broaden their minds except this thing's atheist have to open their mind to accept these things this is this things are real people like you and Mara who are just oblivious to your previous lives
you don't think about these things you got to spend some time and think like what was I doing that got this you've done something you've had some desires that earned you a Camaro body and mind we've got work to do a lot of work to do we're not as evolved as rug enough to ask
 who do you ask I asked God because if you don't see yourself is bigger than your body
 you'll always live with in this rainy idea of yourself you're mine or that down there we call house to buy not real you're not real. You hear me thank you thank you God damn that's not real
 cater not seem to care enough comes to Delhi with his son her son
the story we were just getting started
 I thought you were going to like this we don't have picked you like it it's just you got to chop this thing up now they know we're going to make a YouTube video Tales details so he go is there with his son her son and his new wife
 they go to Delhi they went to wrong bundles house the next day to mislead Shanti Devi kunji model introduced K or not as the ladders elder brother
 Shanti Devi blushed and suit on one side someone asks why she was busting in front of her husband's elder brother shunti said in a low firm voice no he is not my husband's brother he is my husband himself
 then she dressed her mother didn't I tell you that he is fair and then he has a wart on his left side cheek near his ear
she then asked her mother to prepare meals for the guest when the mother asks what should you prepare she said that he was fond of stuffed potato piratas and pumpkin squash is right now is dumbfounded as these are his favorite dishes then cater not asked whether she could tell them anything unusual to stablish full faith in her shunt you replied yet there's a well in the courtyard of her house where I used to take my bath shunti was emotionally overwhelmed at seeing navneet this is her son but he's older than her LOL weird year and a half or so older than that we are going to do but you have children somewhere is that weird to think like that since he was a most you overwhelmed on scene of need the son of a previous life tears welled in her eyes when she hugged him she asked her mother to bring all her toys and give them enough to eat
 but she was too excited to wait for a mother to ask to act and random
cater not ask her how she recognized them need as as her son when she had seen him only once as an infant before she died shunt explained that her son was a part of her soul and that the soul is able to easily recognize this fact
 the philosophy gets warped but okay after dinner you see you got to get out of your little rug not world going to throw it against the gold standard of cycling you're not that you are okay after dinner shunti a skater not recognize not real just remember that after dinner shunti a skate or not why did you ask this is Heavy after dinner Shante turn decayed or not I said why did you marry her referring to his present wife she's right in the room like why did you find her
not decided that you will not remarry that was his new wife yeah she said like before I died we decided that you weren't going to remarry but then you went and married her why did you do that kid or not tied with Dad is he were dead you wouldn't know you're not that no reply
 during his stay and Deli kid or not found shunti devious Behavior similar that can look you in many ways before retiring for the night he asked to be allowed to talk with her alone and later said that he was fully convinced that Shanti Devi was his wife love you bye because whenever there many things should mention with no one else except love you could have known at the end of this we're going to find out what she revealed
 Shanti Devi became upset before cater Nots return to Matera on November fifteen she begged to be allowed to go to a tour with him but her parents refused That's Heavy right
 her story spread all over the country through the median many intellectuals got interested in it when Mahatma Gandhi heard about it he called Shanti Devi talk to her and then requested her to stay
Sasha when I get to reschedule David 1986 you still remembered the incident Gandhi appointed a committee of 15 prominent people
 including parliamentarians national leaders and members from the media to study the case the committee persuaded her parents to allow her to accompany them to Matera they left by rail with Shanti Devi on November 24th 1935 the committee's report described some of what happened right now she's going to mature
 I thought you were going to like this right now if you keep pulling up this girl this is why I keep going keep going keep going for right now, okay as soon as the train approached me to her she became flush with joy and remarks that by the time they reach maturity the doors of the Temple of Darkness will be closed her exact language was Monday or k-pod band ho jayega
sochenge so typically used in the Torah
 the first incident which attracted our attention on reaching which war happened on the platform itself the girl was in LD spawn do sarms he had hardly gone fifteen Paces when an older man wearing a typical mature dress whom she had never met before came in front of her mixed in a small crowd and paused for a while she was asked whether she could recognize him his presents reacted so quickly on her that she'd once came down from mr. Gupta slap and touch the strangers ft with the Federation instead of side are acquiring she whispered in LDH bundles here that the person was her Jake

 she wants to say yes just blink if it's true my father who played Rudy wants to hear some reason for telling you to put this girl down I should have let him read it you read it you don't have it okay she gets down for the Tonga she notices an elderly person in the crowd she merely bowed
and told others that he was her father-in-law and truly was so she reached the front of the house she went in without any hesitation was able to locate her bedroom she also recognized many items of hers she was tested by being asked where the judge threw the laboratory was and she and she told where was she was asked what was meant by Keturah she correctly said that amount of per rata a type of fried pancakes those words are prevalent only in the Chow B's amateur at no Outsider would normally know that he then asked to be taken to her other house where she live with Kate or not for several years she got to the driver there without any difficulty
 one of the committee members pundit nakey Rama Sharma asked her about The Well of what she had talked in Delhi she ran in One Direction but not finding a well there she was confused even then she said with some conviction that there was a well they're cater not removed the stone at that spot and sure enough they found a well
 as for the
add money Shanti took the party to the second floor and show them a spot where they found a flower pot but no money the girl however insisted that the money was there paid or not later confessed that he had taken out the money after Lucy's death when she was taking to her parents home or at first she identified her aunt is her mother but soon corrected her mistake she went to sit in her lap she also recognized her father the mother and daughter wept openly at their meeting it was a sin which move everybody there Sunday David then was then taken to the dwarkadhish temple and two other places she talked to her earlier and almost all her statements were verified to be correct the publication of the committee's report attracted worldwide attention. The entire world well it did it got me thinking like cover in a why doesn't Ali stepper Gandhi figured out why
just go to Every major newspaper round-the-world okay hold it
 with we got it wrong concept of reality check this out with it that's what happened actually many learning personalities including stains parapsychologist and philosophers came to study the case some and support summons critics trying to prove it a hoax
 okay then he needs Shanti Devi yourself LOL he goes to Matera he asked her various relatives to describe when she first visited them is so he did like he kind of research the whole thing years later
 okay I'll go to ride with her he says during my investigations it does a lot of interesting details but there's so much I can tell your ear and see I'm not going to do this one last thing
 there's one last thing
 when she conceived
 the child navneet
what does Dominique mean
 navigate to Toscana she had arthritis some kind of severe arthritis in a previous life yeah
 and so when when when the ex-husbands previous life husband
 said I want to speak alone with her
 he said that you had arthritis when we conceived our child
 he's talkin to like a eight year old or something like that right it's sort of weird if it wasn't real and he said how did
 how how did you how did we conceive
child when you had that physical condition that was so difficult
 and then she described in detail
 how exactly how they did it
 and when he heard that he was like okay though there's a lots of stories like this isn't a real story I've got real stories like this I told you I had to tell you before I'll say it again
 I can I can clear this up for the world right here I had it I had a student long time ago when I first moved to Upstate New York and I told the story of Maharashtra K2 but the child is dying and then announce the solving brought back into the body and in the middle of the class like in the beginning of the class I'm starting class and the and the speed in the warm and I'm not going to look at your screen 34 minutes of a squirrel you're going to hear my 3-minute squirrel story
I have no pauses it's just going to keep going so she's she started crying so I thought maybe we'll maybe she had a child that died I should change the topic and after class I change the topic tall yoga class forgot about it after class I went up to her I said hey I'm sorry but you seemed upset when I was a child that died and she said yeah I said I never believed any of this stuff but then when I have my first child you know he was sickly and heat the doctor said he was never going to live but he kept on living and at Age 3 he was in and out of hospitals at Age 3 the doctors called us in to say goodbye to our child and so we went in there we are crying miraculously
 the kid left and but when he was like three and a half and he could just start speaking
 he said to me Mom
do you remember when you were in the hospital and you thought I was dying I wasn't dying I was not I was Eagles I was out the window watching you I was watching the doctors and I was watching you and Dad is like a three-year-old talking I was watching you and Dad and I was in the I was in a tree and is I was with two people a blue person and a red person and I'm at day the red the blue person said he was going to make my owie go away
 I don't know what those beings were on the what those beings were if they were Angels or something like that but when the I said this to the when the woman told me this she said when the little child said that he was describing the operating room
 there is no way he could have understood what was going on and he said it back so lucidly
that I burst into tears that's what you said I burst into tears and I tried to tell my husband and my husband was was hard for my husband to believe and I said did he say anything else you said yeah I said all these crazy things for about it you know the baby 10 months more and then he just stopped talking about it I said what else did he say he said do you remember when you were my sister we were so close but then you died
 it was so sad when you died and he just went into the death of the mother
 crazy stuff to say that Robin I told that story to a bunch of yoga teachers and one of the yoga teachers who was from somewhere else I was doing some International Workshop she said to me that's a great story but that's nothing I have one I had one student who called me up crying and she said
 I have a daughter
 that
spontaneously started speaking Spanish she's three years old we don't speak Spanish we don't watch TV I have no clue how she knows Spanish but she's speaking Spanish
 and then yesterday
 she told me how she died at her wedding
 three and a half year old stay to go back in and find investigate it
 I don't know if she investigated investigate that that's pretty cool and that's a very common thing that's a very kind of silly in Spanish speaking countries speak other languages so the real question is what were you got you this meat carcass you think about that think about that Mara
forward I just want to read you this very end of a chunti Davies case is also significant for the fact that was one of the most thoroughly investigated cases study by hundreds of researchers critics collar Saints an eminent public figures from all parts of India and abroad from the mid-1930s on one critic Stewart law nerstrand
 when he heard of this case came all the way from Sweden to expose the fake as he thought it to be but after investigation wrote this is the only fully explain and proven case of reincarnation there is not true it's only one you've explained right so they're all over the place and then then he says I closed my story of Shanti Devi with three marks of doctor in Stevenson leading Authority on reincarnation who said I also interviewed Shanti Devi her father and other printed waste Witnesses including Kate or not
 the husband
play a previous life my Research indicates that she made at least 24 statements of her memories that match the verified facts
 24 statements about the Mystic guy met and honeydew are who told me Rocka was my father that was crazy that was crazy this guy knew everything about me
 but you know beyond the
 I don't know the the fascination that monkey taken this kind of thing you know that there's kind of like a sober kind of aspect to it that that's what I was trying to drive home
 thank you for for Joshua had to drive that home but you know it is it's a fact you look like if you look at the research of doctor that you know and others have you talked to a skeptic extra juice on the juice on the idea that that the soul is not matter that that we actually that our existence is
not a creation of material elements that we you know live in many different bodies that we are like a our existence is eternal and we we were born into different bodies and then if you're talking to skeptic you know any established that obviously this can't be proven using material instruments because it we're talkin about it and a type of energy that that's not perceivable through material instruments then what would it take to convince you and they might say well
 if you had not just one but let's say like many examples are because it one example you could always like try to save some bizarre crazy coincidences were happy yeah that's hundreds of incidences that were well research by people that you know we're being careful in their investigation to see that the the the laboratory kind of conditions or cat food out yet you're not in a light day
done with the thorough kind of skepticism you investigated each of these and you found that there are hundreds of incidents is where there were people talking about their previous children talking about their previous lives and giving details that there was no way multiple details what if there are hundreds of such cases how can you ask what's your answer you come up with a better aunt there is no better answer you don't have an answer
 by the way I just giving you guys a few hours of fun you owe me one the Carol Bowman reincarnation Message Board is on the aare message Chat gave you a whole Shelf full and you didn't even appreciate it I did appreciate it I did appreciate it I would have chopped it up and made a little bit more concise but I appreciate you and I asked out a little bit cuz I think it's a big wide I think it's a big wide wonderful world and sometimes I feel like you missed out on it but I appreciate that cuz
Message Board you going to get this is a late night Rabbit Hole you can just go and just read these messages by innocent people were just like what the heck is going on with my child there's a whole world of conspiracy series and pseudoscience out there that you brought in Your Vision what are you talkin about I just gave you a hold of show do you know so is that guy reincarnation it's all real and once it's once you know it's real
 then you got to think about how every choice that you're making right you got to think about how you spend your whole perspective where he's got to start being nicer to people and be nice when people are people going to come back to you because I'm nicer to me sometime
yeah yeah I got to be nicer to you going to come back as you yeah he's very interesting and you can get past life regressions that's real also a second type of hip hip hip hypnosis that puts all your Brit he's so we can remember we can actually the theory is we can actually remember our past lives but birth is like traumatic and sorta like it shuts down and the brickies gets stirred up in the consciousness
 airport in our Modern Age of texting and a quick lots of information dumps we can't remember what we did this morning or last night or something but when you can get the mine to the British start to settle there is a tunnel to our previous existence and our memory is very very powerful we can go back like truthfully lifetimes
I think maybe just too sober the whole thing up here in grounded I got to be honest I would like to hear people who have children in our community that have remembered previous lives that's not what I miss you. We should read a little bug of agita
 little little bit about the difference between the body and the Soul that's what it's purified to hear you know when when I was with Louie couple weeks ago this is what we read and when we read it it was just like its Eternal you know the stuff is eternal knowledge it's like and this is the beginning of any religion any culture
 and it's just Eternal truth
 is eternal truth in Ennis the beginning of understanding who we are and what we're doing and what this is all about the begins right here by understanding we've lived many lives were not these bodies this is not the whole story this little chunk that worrying say it out loud is not
real it's just a rented vehicle say it out loud okay you ready right now. This is purifying
