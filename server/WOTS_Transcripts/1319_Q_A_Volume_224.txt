 alright mr. Castillo how are you doing good burger all good in your life keep it a simple so I like them quite a few questions let me read a question to you Rowena okay I think it was 2 weeks ago
 we did a culinary and some had a question about like their dog passing away and how to prepare their dog for that time and all that remember that yeah
 and so we got a question it it did actually it was kind of it says it's a bit.
 Cryptic and how it was a question cuz it's it's anonymous
 maybe it was an anonymous I got it but it came as a comment and it had like a bunch of question marks in a
connection points is kind of like the subject
 and it was in relation to that to that answer that we gave and I think it is a quote from sure the proudhon is this answer the question but I think there's a question in implicit in it so it hears ears with the quote that they gave him proper his head according to The Vedic system
 the dog is not allowed to enter the house
 at least one person who sort of like rallying around a Vedic system and put a? And! Are you crazy that that that's what that means it would seem like that's what the question marks and! Would mean it's like how could you why would you say such a thing in other words I think what they were asking the hell out of the house right now a proud pie talking about The Vedic system and he's saying that it shouldn't be dog in the house you got a question from people that are apparently practicing boxing take
guidance from you why aren't you repeating this instruction and telling them get the dog out of the house why are you treating it as if it's a normal acceptable kind of thing so let me just finish this quote is as according to The Vedic system a dog is not allowed to enter the house because of their on cleanliness cats and dogs are not allowed within the department of a gentleman but her soul train that they stand outside the compassionate householder with Supply food for the dogs and cats who eat outside and then go away
 so I guess what they're saying is here to Vedic system aren't you guys teaching the real Vedic system I guess because we don't live with in this culture
 here's a deal it's like you can take a little bit of the stuff for you can take you can live like I'm not sure anybody is going to be able to fall The Vedic system in the west so perfect and if we do it's going to exclude the whole world
you know so I feel like in order to really spread the Holy Name which is the essence of what we do the create recreating The Vedic system isn't the essence of what we do
 is Channing the holy name and stop finding fault with people
 and serve the devotees
 and I think we have to chore to take that into whatever degree we can
 and I think the answer is pretty simple you can add we're trying to encourage people to add the essence of Vedic culture to our life not that we all become perfect brahmins
 so do you say I just feel like I'll never have that high standard and I think it's going to try with one of her next question says I'm okay with that I was trying to raise my standard but I'm okay if I don't have this high high betak standard because I live a different life and I'm okay
I don't I don't hate myself for it and I and I feel that tension but not in a way that that I feel like I'm I suck I can't go forward
 I just want to try something else let me try Christianity their little bit more forgiving it's not like that I don't feel like that you know I think I had and I have pulled up in a letter from Prague pot. This is kind of testimony you bright do you know country-by-country ballertv.com I don't know. I think I know who she is and what she shows us interesting kind of
 kind of experience that she had was real property
 and she's describing that she was like 16 years old when she first started coming around and visiting temples and tell him I love those
just like water out of the house but if she lived in she lives at home but she said she said when I first started going to Temple had just turned sixteen and I was still in high school I was interested right away and wanted to know more more about Swami ji cuz that's what how they called should probably so imma get the time
 I also wanted to tell Sheila Prophet everything that I did I told him that I was living at home far from the temple and that my mother wouldn't let me go to the temple but that I had an alter and I've offered for Sodom and everything that I thought was beautiful to Krishna and that was her extension sounds good so she says I wasn't a natural earthy thing so I put Cattails and Moss and bar, I want to do that people do that but not standards is Stephanie not The Vedic standard no but I've seen people do put beautiful rocks you know but yeah. Tails dried flowers
I think the point that she's making is I didn't even know what I was doing that you'll give you generally don't put moss on the Altar and you know although mosses beautiful yes
 so as she continues I was totally honest she said I broke crotch she'll probably do a six-page letter telling him everything I was doing I wanted to be totally honest and lay it all out to him exactly how I went to school did my homework chatted on the subway and so forth. You could say what are you doing on the subway when you change to be very you know that you sit up properly you focus yourself you know
 but that's not what how Prophet responded he said he wrote back accepting everything I was doing saying my sincere blessings for you for your nice prosecution of Krishna Consciousness whatever you doing at the present moment is approved by me and I think on account of your becoming a sincere soul Christmas dictating from within and you are
doing things so nicely it was so encouraging especially as the years went by that I gradually realized as I gradually realize the standard of devotional service and Duty worshipping temples at property stablished I remember one devoted as she will probably have you told us all the rules and regulations provide said if I told you everything you'd faint he clearly gave us a clearly gave us as much room he gave us much room to toddle along
 so yeah I think what you're saying is very important so it's like all there there's a boatload of Vedic standards
 I didn't follow all of them and he didn't teach all of them but really what the idea is this you you you you apply them as they are effective that you can bury someone in them and just completely like snuck out their enthusiasm to yeah then you become an institution of rules and regulations you forget the point
Hearts not turned on and you just have a bunch of people policing your rules it's it's not a beautiful environment that's what I like our community up here Super Soul because I don't think we put off that Vibe it makes it very sort of warm and homey which is I think what people should do they should have a home temple in their environment where you can have your standard of your home and I think it's also very nice to
 if you want to feel like you know sometimes I feel like yeah you know I need to raise my shit need to think keep things a little clearer I need to change this habit or change that habit but I feel like it's not just at my age but where I'm at in my spiritual life is I'm not kicking my dog out of my house to follow some basic code that has nothing to do with me and my family and I don't feel like God hates me for it either I don't think it's going to be a disqualification for me going back to
that's my statement okay it sounds a little like you got to look chip on your shoulder there with! In question I don't even want to read too much into exactly what they're sad just wanted to respond to you know I'm right
 it and I think it's important different people on different levels you're not even different levels were too
 well it certainly are different levels of following Vedic standards I don't think that's a problem say that right well but if you say different levels can generally with levels there's a hierarchy of a level head and then I think there are hierarchies said that level but I think there is hierarchies of levels but we're not interested in Vedic hierarchy that's the point that's the point where was Kyra keys to the degree that they facilitate the essence which is Krishna Consciousness sure and sometimes trying to push someone to a to a to a higher level
FedEx standard isn't going to help them it might even discourage them and so you know that therefore you apply it probably was applying that you know he used to say I could criticize my my God Brothers
 you know they did cuz it for instance in the monasteries in India generally women are they don't live there they're home with her parents until they get married and they don't move into a monastery women don't move it out of their home until they're married that's like a betta tradition yeah that's Aveda tradition and probably said more or less exactly what you just said about the dog he said I can't send them away they come here he he saw that in this world in the Western World boys and girls are mixing together you know as as is there it's the way that they live I'm not going to try to change that I'm going to adopt to that and bring Krishna Consciousness into that in whatever way I can you know
 by the way
I don't know how this happened but a thumbs-down came on the screen while you were speaking today I made it look like I would put in my thumbs down I was not put in my thumbs down thumbs up and thumbs down come up their own accord and what I was saying I don't know what to give a thumbs down you give it a thumbs down to the fact that prompt I'd no allow women to live in the temple or you give it a thumbs down to it like ancient standards that have gone on for a you know that they just had a different different people in different cultures live differently you know
 it's it's so any case it's your point was important I got that. It's not that we live for Vedic standard we apply bit extender because we live for Krishna consciousness
 Hearts of Iron 4 next question Special K
 by the way before we get to the next question tomorrow leaving the interview day tomorrow with the very interesting cool old friend of mine
are the sorority who was who's actually became Krishna conscious during the Iraq War now and he's got lights or fighting in the Iraq War and now he does what's it called Mara
 no that's it what's I called Rick Rolled us ultra running and Triathlon kind of thing km but anyway really interesting guy lot of interesting realizations I think whenever you're around and faced with death on a regular basis you got a lot of realization and especially immersed in
 Army culture and you know in the end in the type of talk in the type of banter that goes on within that so I haven't we somehow reconnected and I said you did great for the show so he's going to be on tomorrow 8 a.m. for those who live
Zoom looking forward to hearing from partha sarathi Prabhu
 what's our next. Next question again that next question you want okay so this comes from Tomorrow Govinda dust your name my name is tomorrow Govinda. 26 years old in a come from Slovenia quiz it's kind of like you know next to Croatia I suppose and Ljubljana and I mean as used to be Yugoslavia it's yep you're pretty good at your pretty good I didn't tell you exactly where I mean I kind of just north of Croatian and it used to be okay so rights from Sylvania he says I meant devotees when I was 20
 and I was searching for some meaning in life
 I quickly started coming to program
started chanting and after some years when I finish my education and Telecommunications I decided to become a Brahma chart for one year and singha Chillum Germany so he moved to this is like a farm Temple Community rank
 been there beautiful place send it to you in a very long time for me to take 93 or something like that has last time before they have a big nose ring at a festival coming up there they too now that must be next time you're in the area you should look that up in that year many things happened I was working hard on my sergeant on my daily spiritual practices and other and other spiritual practices and soon I found out that Temple life is not for me it's okay
 but since I committed to one year I kept pushing myself until finally I finally burned out and I ran away and never come back story
what happened I have to have seen that happen a lot people like sort of like just disappear at the fence at us and their antenna short of like sometimes little humiliated and just don't want to show their face around after coming back to Slovenia I was traumatized by temples
 I don't know if he means that he was traumatized by the time and seeing how each of them or if he was traumatized by the other temples so I think traumatized very heavy word yeah you know I mean how I'm interpreting that trauma is not like he was punched out or something I'm interpreting it as like you know I was on the strict regimen of lifestyle and just think I was for me and therefore I just farted like there's like a Kryptonite for me I want to stay away from it so I couldn't get myself to visit one for at least a year
 yeah
still occasionally meeting some devoted friends that was mainly hang out with friends from before my started practicing boxing so soon I stop chanting and doing other Krishna conscious practices trip a sometime I could manage to get myself to the temple and had a great time meeting devotees and beat and being at lectures and cure Townsend festivals but outside of that I don't chat maybe around or two every other day and visit a temple maybe once or twice a month and I feel okay with that now I study photography which was always my passion and work on different creative projects which I love at first I felt bad because I couldn't do devotional stuff that I used to but then after talking with some Swami and telling him about my traumatizing events at the temple he told me not to worry and not to push myself doing anything that I don't feel I can do and I really felt that
occasionally smoke weed I go to nightclubs with my friends I'm dating now you probably judge me in your mind and always okay but the fact is that there are meant there's many many there are many many devotees my age that I personally know that they're in their student hears we're going through the same thing but nobody knows about that right you think we're very naive know a lot of people who know a lot of people up the deal where let you know we've been around because but this is an interesting point. He says because when we're at the temple with the vote is we all pretend to be pure and pukka but we're actually not all right the facts
can you smoke weed at the temple you know you know but I get it there's a feel duplicitous but it's more mental than anything I think it's nice to come to the temple associate with people and be on your A-game I think that's what we do here at the farm we try to get people went across the bridge we're on our a game and I think that's what community does it sort of like lifts you when you're low but I understand I don't think the fact is that we have to pretend like that because those are the huge standards and expectations to follow them and when someone does not he is labelled as fallen and people tend to keep away or some compassionate Souls feel the need to help and save them by preaching you saying compassion in a sarcastic way yet compassionate
 Air Bud
it's like a we got to be compassionate to these Fallen Souls it's almost like oh called compassion the devotee in the temple is an exponentially much higher than you and you are okay I see what this guy's going with this I got it a lot okay now you can sleep in a little bit over the other side okay
 same both sides of this right yeah well thank you but I'm okay where I am I really I really wanted it now he's digging his heels in okay
 okay well thank you but I'm okay where I am I really deeply appreciate that people are concerned with other spiritual life and sincerely want to help but I am where I am and I'm not fake my way to somewhere where I'm not and I think this is side he does not understand that
 there's a huge gap from how normal people live and how devotees do this is significant I think and I think that the problem is is that there's no level in between those two
so then people like me or lost not belonging anywhere I get it that's importance to the observation I think
 I love Krishna I love devotees I really love to chant and sing in the kirtan I love to read Bhagavad Gita should involve time and she tiny charts in retail but right now I don't want to commit to all those high standards of regularity and for this Society that's not acceptable even if you say it is it's not enough and we can get into this but I think that I'm looking at right now you think I'm going to go through, like cornflakes you got in your cabinet I'm throwing those out you got a dog I'm getting rid of him kicking him out of here what the heck is going on here for Snooki no one's like that at
I don't know ones like that people are like that there are masses are not like that the masses are trying to add Krishna to their life and not micromanage people spiritual life maybe they did not our business to micro my it's not our business to micromanage other people's lives but that's well that's his point you said that's what that's what I get when I go to the temple I get that kind of attitude and guess what you get when you give me the temple generally you get a bunch of new devotees like he was you get a bunch of new devotees who all of a sudden they go from their regular life and now they think they are some like Parma hamsa and they're going out doing all the preaching to the types of people you meet Jenna with these temples are the preachers who are like one year into bhakti and they they feel just like any fanatic and so we've had Fanatics be our mouth piece or what we're representing
to see what you're saying but sometimes it seems also
 that it's it's kind of like a less sensitive people that hang on and take these leadership positions and go there go on forever I mean we see that to do me sometimes it's the last ones who are like maybe they are the most Arthur maybe they're not even met they're just pretending to be maybe I just need a place to live maybe they just can't conceive of any other lifestyle and their they are in there and there's hardly anyone around them because their attitude doesn't really attract anyone and they and they have I think that exists as well write thank you get from seeing our people as well sure okay I think we have to find people who are mature that get it and I think I really love to listen to Sage's Community I love our simulated had something to say about that to say this to all right cuz he's at he's saying this guy
wait hand that okay so he says even if you said he's saying that to be me and who I am is not acceptable in this Society even if you say even if you're going to tell me it is I'm telling you it's not my point is it you know what in some places it is in some places it's not like there's different moods and even a different city you can find two temples are very different it may be in Sylvania you don't get that I don't know I don't know anything about the baby is always that subtle voice in the background saying we expect you to come to our level but I don't want to see some like mean brahmacharya looking down upon him I felt that myself
 he says but I don't want to I want to go through my spiritual life at my Pace I feel like there's no play
show me in the society and temples people with high standards look down on me with non devotees I keep my spiritual spirituality to myself because I would be again labeled as we get it from both ends here maybe just the world is real bad if you're not boycotting Israel or boycotting Palace that you're putting up a black Square on your Instagram everybody's trying to judge you and cancel you is not sure it's a large mantel world it's a judgmental now he says this or not even in your podcast I just sent I think it's coming after you not me
 I think he's talking about Mara here when he says this homemade he says even in your pockets I sent a shuttle pushing that
I want us to have all pocket apply stander's Mara Mara enough okay people purchasing all your clothing in the stores about knitting your own hook his but he's feeling this by Blink-182. We welcome them all
 but still okay it's almost to the podcast today it's almost time I understand and appreciate that you want to help and save us from Material energy but I don't want and feeling that really turns me off
I don't know maybe it's kind of just not a place for me and I would need to look for some other communities but I feel sad about it it would be nice if there would be some place in the society for a spa on people where we can sing and kirtan and listen about Krishna without always having that subtle pushing of needing to improve and be pure sure then I'm forced to pretend I'm pure
 and lie at that I follow said no but deep down but deep down I feel disgusted that I have to do that I want to be myself right where I am and I want to be accepted for who I am and where I am maybe I ask too much but that is just how I feel and I wanted to share that with you guys because I really love you your podcast was there for me in the hardest times and even now when I'm swimming in the material ocean I still listen to it occasionally I would really like to hear your thoughts on these topics thank you very much I love you
 I'm going to jump in first and then I got to run to the bathroom okay
take this person don't take it personally just don't bring your cell phone into the bathroom and I'll never get out I hear you and I know what that tension is it's not necessarily bad and I think when you hear it from us you will feel attention and I think that's natural in any Community cuz the community's always trying to upgrade but I think that tension is a healthy tension I think as you mature and bhakti there's no more condemnation or you're not mature we don't condemn we do discern we have to discern just like I'm a parent I have to discern like where my kids going out tonight who who's going to be at the party or going to be at we want to keep that the sermon but we don't believe in condemnation I know in my own life I don't condemn good friends we're doing horrible things
 I just don't I just have to discern if I need if I want the
in my life so I think it's important I think to not condemn I think that's something we have to work towards practicing and I think people have a lot of they have a whole plethora of great qualities even if you're not following a principal and I think our body Community has to like mature like that and I think that also a lot of the things that the words we hear in a regular basis are from people who have a fanatic mentality but I feel like if you're happy where you're at then don't sweat it be happy where you're at but expect attention always to be there and you don't have to be necessarily duplicitous you can just be happy where you're at and come together and serve the devotees and one thing I find I want to put this out there cuz it's very important if that Community is not serving your body if you just feel like I'm hated I'm condemned there's two things first check your own head
 do you have
guilt you're carrying around and if you do get over your guilt because you're going to take that into other places where you feel less then you'll take that everywhere you think that everybody is out to get you you're looking to be offended but if it's actually the community just doesn't encourage your God Consciousness and you feel just shamed make your own Community make your own community and for people who are struggling with any institution guess what you don't need it you can be part you can create your own little community and and that means you get people together and you seemed and when you come together you do keep a high standard like the devil has a high standard that's okay you come together and you said hey let's try not to criticize let's not try not to find fault with try not to condemn people will try to serve each other and once a week on Friday nights instead of going to a pub or something you get together and read the Bhagavad Gita is saying something somebody Cooks prashad you have a potluck
it is but the whole we should understand the whole throw the baby out with the bathwater that's just as bad as the other fanatic who's telling you better be higher cuz right now you better follow all these principles
 Throwing It All Out is also a type of fanaticism so we have to figure out how we can integrate it into our life we were sort of where were rising up higher and guess what life is very short sometimes Krishna white might accelerate our bhakti we might get some type of sickness chronic disease and we want to be that we want us to be in the mix with devotees in our life and you may want to extend your hand to other people who are like my did you want to add Christian to their life cuz we need community community has a necessity for us just having a peaceful healthy life people want Community we're social beings so I think it's important that if we
we don't jibe with a particular Community we create our own community
 and you be and you learn to be very to sort of Power with others and maybe and an n and if you're happy with yourself be happy with yourself it's okay to be happy with yourself but expect there to be a little bit of tension that's in any Community than one sort of upgrade a little and find those devotees who you drive with and hang out with them stupid I'm passing the Baton to you okay thank you know we've been kind of laughing and joking and and and so on but it it's a it's an important question and I appreciate them all govinda's honesty not now he's asking us our thoughts on on his long question and I can't give it like I don't know you I don't know the circumstances and what you've what you're going through there so it's like
 I can only speak in generalities
you're you're you're you're bringing up some really important points I think when you said this you said there's a huge gap from how normal people live and how devotees do that's that's a fact and I really did the standards of the life standards are are very different there's a reason for that and but it's
 you know I almost feel like in the in this world we have to expect that when people come to any kind of
 spiritual culture or really any kind of movement of self-improvement that you're going to find a gradation of how people relate to identify people that relate to it in very problematic are simplistic ways
 and then people that have a very refined understanding of a very mature understanding of it and every gradation between those two you're going to play
end in Baki there's a kind of laid out his kanishka you know it's like the the real beginner and then my GM is kind of the middle person they've developed a better Acumen for kind of appreciating people where they're at and relating to them accordingly and then there's the automobile kind of sees no distinctions right there like that they've got there not trying to prove anyone
 so that's going to always be I think a part of me is kind of responding to look into some of wood from a few different angles but I think there is something to kind of that stoic point of view where it's kind of like the world is what it is
 is my duty not to sit here and complain about it you know I can approve it to whatever extent I can and then I accept it and I make the best of it I think a little just reading your whole letter I'm wondering if a little bit of that stoicism might be
for you to run Govinda did you say there's going to be people that are immature you know it sounds like you had a Swami there though it's Amal Govinda I'm certain it sounds like you had a Swami there that was quite open to you in quite understanding you know there's going to be people that do understand you and do except you where you are and you know him with your stove Viewpoint you can send it to people that don't and whether they do or don't that's really not so much my business is my business is connecting to Krishna
 I'm moving at the pace that I'm moving at if they have a problem with that I suppose that's their problem is not my problem I don't need to get all worked up about that so I think that could be healthy now for all I know you've been through some you actually met have been through some really traumatic trimmer just some really just some really you know I don't know if you've been exposed to some really callous you know fanaticism or if if just you might have an issue with as it with guilt and people are just respond
in in very natural and respectful and considerate ways in your interpreting that
 as they're there looking down on me there they're condescending and it's uncomfortable I have no idea right but but what I said was important I think that there has to be some tension in society that we don't grow without a little tension so I would say that it would be wise to to want my community want my friends want want those that are near to me to accept me for who I am yes that's important but also to kind of that their association their words and their their their sociation is is encouraging me to always be moving forward
 that's that's that's important to you know this this process about the for it to
 really transform one it requires you know this
some some real determination you know to to leave behind things that are
 problematic and embrace those things which are helpful
 he mentioned he says he said you know I drink occasionally smoke weed I go out tonight clubs with my friends and dating
 now you probably Judge Me in Your Mind
 for that what how do you know that I showed you my my for that war do you interpret like
 I would like princess in my mind that doesn't mean that you're a bad person it doesn't mean that you're low or sinful
 from Yogi's perspective it just makes me think well drinking and smoking weed and going out tonight clubs in casual sex
 these things Cloud ones they make it more difficult for one to be a yogi that's not judgemental that's just scientific
 and but it doesn't make me think you're bad I've done all those things you know it
and and I have friends that do those things and and I and I love sitting down with him and kirtan and I'm not going to sit there and start harping on them to change their lifestyle you know so I can get hard for me to say whether
 they've got something to learn you got something learn or everybody's got something going to read in a In-N-Out the wisdom of the ages and are we know we have a vision statement and a mission statement and we have a statement of our core values what is it and you know there's a there's a balance to the corporate we kind of adopted this from the Bucky centers core values but I want the Three core values one of them is deeply rooted right this is with faith and love in the bucket tradition of shooter
I'll shoot a Tonya as Todd we want we want our podcast we want our community to be deeply rooted with faith and love in the bucket traditional shige Tanya as talking exemplified by she'll probably okay that's so that's like that kind of grounded conservative side but then kind of bouncing that out we have another poor guy you called branching out which is through a culture of inclusion we see every soul is important Christmas service and reach out with non-judgmental compassion and the thoughtfulness to make the message of boxy relevant and accessible
 so we're trying maybe maybe maybe we could do better but at the same time maybe you want to like maybe you think our podcast should just be anemic of all encouragement to improve
 you know so it's it's there's always a battle to end in his right mind saying maybe you need to find your community maybe you need to end maybe it's hard to find
so all those are my good just a big you asked for my thoughts are those just got home a collection of thoughts you know but deep down you know I really wish you the best to remove into the truth listens to her husband we know he's there to there in Sylvania yeah we do some really great people from Croatia that are very accepting and so on right in and hang out with road rage and you'll get out of that car put his hands in the air all 6 ft 5 maybe maybe we should maybe tomorrow then if you come to Italy Italy China, maybe we can do what we get in touch with us we'll do what we can to try to make it possible in any of your butt right out of it
no chill
 we want we should we are devotees we think of ourselves as Fallen who's using volunteers, so I can put down there's like yeah that's how that's how advanced devotees think of themselves and everyone else is probably think I'm very falling in the hole like we're always there is always attention of how can I go higher how can I go higher right we're like we've been reading the last few days of all the higher beings are offering prayers but then there's another higher being and I'll bring mine almost more refined prayer now it's okay it's okay to all feel Fallen that's part of our culture in Western culture that Fallen that feeling of falling this has to do a lot of self-hate and therefore I can get it can be a little triggering to apply for a suffering from lack of self-worth do right and you know Tyrone Govinda also kind of I think come out in
I want to keep him out of anger and he kind of nicely Illustrated articulated this
 something that's their inmost spiritual communities to some degree or another where this where there is duplicity I'd like another wizard were pretending that were something that we're not and that's not healthy here's a deal cuz dude it's not going to go away with these people commit crimes in the Catholic Church of any type of church or institution horrible horrible crimes are not going to go away this is the world we live in
 they're always be a wolf in sheep's clothing and just you know sometimes the sheep or just a little wolfish you with his horns
going to be a little bit of where we have to have a little bit disturbing we have to do our due diligence we have has best weekend and if they're really proud of your life I do there's certain people that I know they're like that and whenever I see him I don't even talk to him and you know what I mean and it's even still he wants to go to the sermon you like we don't even the people that have troublemakers I don't condemn them I don't want to close to me because if they're real if they're real troublemakers you know we have to pick we have two hands like people we want in our life. You know that a lot of people get turned off by some Temple some random Temple somewhere in the world Guess What Make Your Own Temple miss a dinner party I'm making I'm making rice and all,
silver all right very good
 are you ready for the next question we have one more today
 yeah yeah yeah are you reading it to me or am I reading to you and your reading you doing all the reading today okay from South of the Border what's up is like you like my new youth of today shirt stand up nice and
 that's an old school design right that's better that's a classic. I don't have a lot of time this is coming from capital G
 we love her writing from Ecuador / Venezuela
 and she'd this is a question from a person that's in her age group that we have two Spanish-speaking Sage groups that's so cool
okay so she rides a Harley Bowl Familia buenos dias
 our Sage group has a special teams as a special member Pamela from Argentina
 new tabaki she already has deep realization that a beautiful connection to the practice she chance read the scriptures it has created a beautiful Altar for meditation and offerings
 recently her husband had a minor surgery Pamela shared how she served him with unconditional love and patience letting go of arguments which was a big step for her however she has a question for both of you here's the question how can I support someone who doesn't share my beliefs
 every word I had was based on scripture and the music I wanted to share we're mantras but they don't resonate with him
 muchas gracias this age groups are truly making a difference
 all right.
I think this is a common question right bro. That's like my spouse is not exactly into what I'm into didn't want to hear the kirtan that I'm playing in the you know they don't want to hear from the scriptures they don't mean anything to them yeah I'm I supposed to support them how my supposed to help some of that I'm living so closely with intimately with
 first of all you got to see if
 it's not our job necessarily to make our partner to Goldie's but I think people are a spiritual Pappy wanted they want to share similar and Joyce with them in their life
 it always boils down to be the best example of what a devotee is
 and and if you are guess what that person loves you and there they let a person will make advancement that person makes advancement beak
they love you and they serve you but how do we make advancements by loving and serving devotees boom that's how it all fits together perfectly great example make yourself into such a kind-hearted vyshnavi or by shenava and people at 8 it's very attractive and people want to give love note when relationships with people are serving us anyway so really it's up to you that's one way and then you can find some Venn diagram that were there is some, then later example Lori pack took her husband Italy
 yep and he's like Muhammad Ali and I'll go I want to support my wife therefore he wants to support his wife next thing you know God's got a court to on spiritual but Cee just started in the same way you and I got into cure time we got into this we got into some maybe bhakti perhaps some trite reason like I said it's free
vegetarian food let's go and then all of a sudden our senses get purified by Rashad maybe they like to eat cook and offer food right place to eat right sell cook prashad with love offer it with love and offer them the prashad if they don't like your time to so many other senses that we could do you know another thing I do is Nate Les Paul is like such a you know famously gorgeous and we have sat song everyday so you just have to know the dose to give a person nice but we do as activities we do understand that there are higher standards that we want to climb 2
 and that people want to climb to it like you were saying about tomorrow Govinda there's no judgement that you're drinking
going to the club but we've also drank we've also gone to clubs and we also know what that the consciousness of drinking gives you and so therefore there is compassion in the heart that we want to give to other people because drinking a lot of people can ruin their life for some people just ordered that birds their life and covers up some pain
 so so the end there is more refined pleasure and so when you really get that you want to give it to someone not in the Judgment away but in a in a way that will upgrade their life and of course in this case upgrade to relationship
 yeah yeah you know thank you brother not the question is a how can I support someone who doesn't share my beliefs
 I think you know I think if you don't share any beliefs you wouldn't be together sure right but the but we all we all had these mines that are pro
and with certain taste in dumb
 I guess you could say like proclivities to certain things that that our mind usually accepts and certain things that her mind is saying I don't know about that and that's a lot of that is just based on the packaging the extra packaging but my guess is is that to some degree she and her spouse they they do appreciate the same things
 but she but she may be saying here appreciate it in the form of this scripture like the bug of agita and in his mind he may be saying even hearing that word is just alien to me
 you know and it's got ideas that are alien to me reincarnation and so on and so forth that I don't buy into that and it's also got standards and practices like not eating meat or whatever maybe and and so there a wall starts to be built up that's not for me all that stuff not for me
 but there's stuff in there that is for him
I think you know that and when he sees that this tradition is bringing that out in you
 like the love and that you are describing in the you know the unconditional love and in service that you were that you were sharing when he sees this person's really selfless they're really kind of really even minded no matter what happens in life they've got a clear wiseview of it you know it is their kind to everyone that the excetera excetera the more that he feels that you don't have to push the externals on him but just saying this is why I practice is I want to be a better person I want to be closer to God I want to receive godmorn on finding it in the tradition he probably doesn't have a problem with you finding that but the packaging seems alienated and so don't you don't necessarily have to try to you can try but if you find that you're not being successful at getting him over the hurdle of the packaging
 then you just have to deliver the essence and without the package in your
in your daily dealings
 try to think of that try to try to do it we've been talking about this Salata this week and try to focus on not on the details the external superficial details but on the essence
 and if that Essence is something that you were lights two and if he sees that Essences is rising in you through this practice then then it'll become easier in and one thing I said was what you were saying you know what we used to do with the boxer and I was just speaking to talk to someone at the BOK Center about this is that I think we should do combined Bucky Center wisdom of the sages we used to do picnics in the summer in the parks in New York City with the bhakti center 5e harder for the people to Buxton but we can do both but those weren't opportunities where we didn't push anything we didn't push kirtan we didn't push philosophy we just
together we will share for Sodom that's something that everyone can appreciate it and we relaxed with each other and I think a lot of people that came to the bodycenter that were into it but had spouses or boyfriends or girlfriends that it was foreign to they can bring them there
 and they really got the impression all these are normal intelligent nice people you know it was just so relaxed like that and nothing xu2 none of the external kind of triggering things were there and then they really opened up so sometimes it's just giving them that experience like you're saying I think for the chief Italy was something like that you know this is pretty nice it's acting funny I had a picture that it was something else but these are real people that got a lot of interesting stuff to share if we can find those kind of circumstance those kinds of
 if we can create those kind of forums
and like you're saying you could just be dinner party whatever then then sometimes those hesitations as walls and hesitation they'll collapse more easily than we imagine
 I like that okay I think that I have time today sir brother tomorrow everybody 8 a.m. for me and Parts Authority or stories with a hat he was a sniper
