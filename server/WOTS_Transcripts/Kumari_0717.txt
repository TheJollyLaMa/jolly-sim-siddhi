but I just want to
 a Kumari so much for doing this for us
 it's it's it's really is a nice way to
 add to round out like what we're trying to talk to everyone because I talk to you such a not just a yoga practice but very broad culture do you know it's the old practice that involves a very broad culture all the different Cultural Arts are there and and for some reason centuries these Cultural Arts has been handed down
 not just as a well I guess the point that would make it said there's a reason why they're still handed down Beyond just entertainment is that it's it's it's actually in the action is yogurts the way to transfer the Consciousness and so I although I have to run cuz I'm running Upstate I look forward to checking this out later posted on patreon
cuz it just reveals you don't even I don't anticipate myself doing too much bored watching Dance but understanding a better house we not only understands when I see the dance which I'm definitely interested in but also how I understand Bob is on how I understand Christian how I understand all of these dumb stories and passages that we find him in this text if there's an incredible amount of thought that's going into this kind of presentation and it's all connected it all ties in together and Kumari so steeped in it since he was three years old learning on the great Masters I was doing a little research on your on your dance teacher you're going over there it's like getting all kind of really interesting articles as finding online about her so, thank you so much for sharing this with us send
 please take it away
or do you need me there we go
 thank you for
 thank you
 thank you all so much for being here it is one of my greatest Joys to to share dance with others it's especially fun to share in these type of workshops because we get to enjoy and explore without really having too much expectation because oftentimes when they teach students they have expectation of I am I going to be a performer in the next year or am I going to be mastering this art form but really this type of environment is for us to explore and for us to learn and so that is
spelling for me because I get to give freely and fully without any expectation
 so by a show of hands how many of you have seen a first let me ask how many of you seen him in performance live in person by a show of hands
 okay none of you okay great and then raise your hand okay
 thank you Sophie I don't see your video but now I okay perfect thank you and then so by a show of hands how many have you seen a video of a video performance and then some of you haven't been eating myself too much how many of you watched my interview with
okay from that you have a bit of a background understanding of where the dense comes from a little bit of the history so that I don't have to go into that too much again okay great so what I would like to do today and I would also be happy to hear your feedback this is a totally flexible time we can we can take requests we can adjust the cost as needed but I would like this to be an interactive class I mean I would love to see you all dance with me today at some point and so normally the format in which better than a gem is taught is that
 typically a student starts with Nick. Which is the physical aspect with which body movements the rhythmic patterns excetera and then as a dancer matures and in this tiny
we're going to take take a half-hour into class assuming that you've matured as a dancer and we're going to go into a female which is the storytelling is everybody okay with getting up and doing some movement today
 okay awesome dance in a way it's similar to yoga in that sense because it is through the body that we learn to
 learn more about our minds about ourselves and it's through the body's discipline that we actually can overcome the ideas of I am this body and eventually take the body out of it but using the body to transcend to reach some higher understanding so we do begin dance and typically if you were to approach a traditional teacher
 the first
at least the first year at least if not more you would just be learning the body conditioning it would start with just body conditioning but that's not to say that that body conditioning portion of dense cannot be an offering or cannot be considered spiritual it's also very much a part of the full picture
 what I have been realizing as I've been getting older and as I've been diving deeper into this dance is that everything can be an offering so even if you are just sitting in on a Monday and you'll learn what other Monday is shortly and you're just stomping your feet
 and rhythmically you're just creating a continuous pattern
 that in itself although it seems like such a Monday movement it can invoke so much once you allow yourself to deepen that
so I'll go into that further as we learned some of these movements
 I want to begin by offering some prayers as we always do we always begin by offering prayers and then doing a prayer with using the body we offer ourselves
 in
 prayer to Mother Earth was asking her forgiveness to stomp on her secret surface and then also asking for permission
 so I'll begin by just reciting the prayers that we normally recite in the beginning of class
 first we pray to ganapathi with the remover of obstacles
 Moshe Kahana more.
the second prayer is to Shiva Motta Shiva is actually the presiding deity of better than our Jam dance it is his dance of Destruction that we try to emulate and we try to seek
 we look toward him and his dance of Destruction as the Perfection of deaths he is the Lord of Dance
 we offer our prayers to our gurus we offer a prayer to undermine who is the who is the most diverse
we look to him for guidance and how to become devoted how to become clear in our path and always knew in the exact moment he knew exactly what he needed to do in order to serve
 and then the last two verses we offer prayers to Mother Earth to Pony baby
 Vishnu Shakti summer on a Mandalay
okay so let's now arrange ourselves so that we can have a little bit of floor space to work with
 and the ranger camera in a place where you can see me and if I can see you
 okay if I'm standing back here can you all still hear me okay
 I might have to move closer to
 and my husband's going to bring me the Mike so that'll improve the
 okay so we begin this is a prayer that we are expressing
when using our body
 asking for forgiveness and permission to dance on secret so we begin
 you're going to draw your index finger and your middle finger to your thumb and the pinky finger and ring finger are very beautiful
 the hands come in front of the trust now I will remind you of some technical things it's things that involve technique but I don't want you to take any of it too heavily or I want you to enjoy the movement so don't think too much about the technique but it's in my nature to always correct things so we keep our shoulders back and keep our elbows
 okay beautiful and come to a standing position and I'm going to move my camera
come to a standing position with your feet together
 and from here I want you to just explore the Earth Beneath Your Feet by making some gentle steps
 you're feeling the solid groundedness of gloomy they be beneath your feet
 thank you and
 invoke that feeling of gratitude this Earth this Earth is always carrying us always helping us feel grounded
 and there's no denying that in so many ways
does human race have really
 Dundee service to this Earth so we can ask for forgiveness
 okay beautiful we now change our hands to Checotah mudra
 the thumb is basically a thumbs-up position
 and we indicate every direction so keep your hands off her shoulder we reach behind us
 and around
 and back to the chest
 so by using the smooth Rover indicating boobie they be in every direction the earth below us
everything around us
 and the sky above us
 beautiful one more time
 I'm just improving my set up as we go along
 okay
 there we go now I have to make next week can you all hear me well
 okay is this better
 okay good awesome
Okay so
 Chic Ramada indicating all of these directions
 this is more exciting than I thought it was going to be
 thank you
 so we began with the cutter, come with us
 and let's do two steps one and two
 and then we move to Chicago Metra
 all the way around
 and with this we're going to come down we're going to change our positions and we're going to come down to what is called
if this is uncomfortable for you I invite you to take a different position but this is the Moody Monday position if it's a it's a grand plie
 if you would rather do something that's more comfortable even if you just want to come kneeling whatever is comfortable for you just as long as you're bringing your body closer to the Earth
 okay now we're going to take your going to touch Mother Earth
 and bring that to your head as we know in
 invaded culture it's very significant to touch someone's feet to your head right this is a big part of the culture so we're touching the Earth
we're touching bhoomi Devi
 you are head
 again thanking her
 and then we bring her hands to pataka with ra
 what's a flat head with the sunsets and we bring it from the chest
 all the way above her head
 this is offering of pranams are respect to Divinity 2 God to Krishna
 from the region above our head
 Summers head we offer respect to guddu to teachers
 and from our heart we offer respect to one another to humanity to our peers to our colleagues
 for audience
 okay beautiful so that was a prayer to Mother Earth
we explored be feeling of having Mother Earth beneath our feet
 now I'm forgetting this in my kids over here so I can you hear me
 we explored the feeling of having Mother Earth beneath our feet
 and we explore that feeling of groundedness so
 in the typical Brennan prayer
 we would just do two stumps one on each side
 and then we would move on to the SheiKra
 and then we would come down to
 touching Earth
 to our head and then we come to the DACA Madra
 hands above her head to Krishna from our head to Guru and from my heart to one another so let's do that one more time
and I will use the it's called in Tamil is called a cholla cactus it's the syllables that are used to keep the timing but just think of a
 it's it's me just keeping a rhythm okay
 Garland, Texas
 cut that damn thumb
 they are they
 saying they coming down
 Danny
 they say
 they say
 same thing
 beautiful
that is how we would always begin our class and that is how we always end our class as well
 okay now I want to take this time to show you some of the basic positions that we utilize in North. Which is the pure dance aspect so the the basic like positions will go through this
 and if at any point any of this feels tiring
 feel free to take a break don't don't get too hung up on it looking
 a certain way okay
 so
 the first position is called semi butter which is just a feet together position this we've already done right beat together and we can bring our hands to our waste
 finger stuck behind
 then we have
which means
 a lot of our dancing is coming from this position so we get very comfortable here even though it might be uncomfortable this is a position but then I Dreamed a very comfortable and so this is a demanding
 and then
 full sit position is Moto Monday
 so let's go between those three a few times because it also helps helps us warm up muscles okay so bringing her hands to her waist. Come to either Monday
 tell my father
 I do Monday
 Moody Monday
 Adam and Eve
 Summa Banda
 adam-ondi-ahman
adam-ondi-ahman
 do the first set of steps that a dancer learns is called stuck.in.the means slots
 or more accurately stomp right because we're using our feet
 so let we're going to do a couples. Diet it was we wanted too many because they are quad killers and I don't want anyone to feel like they can't walk tomorrow this is extreme leg day if you really really practice these
 so we'll just start with the first letter w
 and I invite you to if at any time it feels intense
and it feels fiery and it feels difficult
 if it becomes too much by all means I invite you to take a break however if you feel inspired to push yourself then a tool that I invite you to use is to imagine shiva's Thunderbird dance the dance she was dance of Destruction and think about okay if I can pray to that dancer can he give me some energy to follow through with this and then whatever pain I'm experiencing can I offer it in that prayer okay so that's one way of doing it the other way of doing it is taking a break which by all means I I completely understand if you if you want to do okay so we start with the ottoman be position
 and we're going to
and then.
 Lift and then stop
 beautiful lift lift and stomp and what we're trying to do is avoid this side-to-side movement what we want to do is utilize our core so that we can keep this straight beautiful okay so we're going to try it if you want to shake your legs up get yourself ready psycho self up we're going to try this in three speeds
 right and left
 right and left
 right and second speed
done
 beautiful really well done
 so nice Okay
 so because this is a crash course
 we're not doing all the steps that..
 It has it is a series of eight different variations
 and that one was the first one
 and we're going to go ahead and skip the rest and we're going to move on to the next set which is called not the other
 and this is where the complexity of the dance goes a little bit further
 I'm a little out of practice
okay
 they're not the other involves a stretching position
 this be called a pretty dumb the name of this like position so this leg is in our Monday and the other leg is stretched and the like that stretched has a perfectly straight me
 okay and then we lift and bring it back
 and we lift and stretch
 and then we left and bring it back yes
 one thing I like to tell my students is that
 when you're doing anything that involves a stretch whether it's your hand or whether it's your leg
 imagine the energy that you are sending from your Center is reaching all the way to the side of the room and Beyond so you are
actually being confined by the outline of your physical body but you are sending energy in every single Direction so picture that has you send that like out
 it actually helps
 give you more energy because
 it helps the the dynamic of the
 of the movement and you'll find that you actually use up more energy when you're trying to hold yourself back then you do when you let yourself free Okay so let's do not the article number one
 which is just one stress on each side
 so we start with the right foot stays
thank you. You can speak thing
 beautiful
 so
 risk it will skip third speed for now
 so they're not the artist they don't just involve the legs like that that died of us but they also involve the hands so this is when the full body starts coming together
 and it almost feels like you're performing a mini dance piece using the hands and the legs
 so if everyone can bring their hands into this is called
Toca Madera
 and I I know that this can sometimes take a little practice but we have some limber fingers here so the ring finger is tucked and the thumb is folded
 beautiful
 if you have to do for now I'm fine with you holding this finger if you need to this is technically a different monitor but for the sake of this exercise no worries
 and then what we're going to do is we're going to bring her arms into the not yet I'm bummed position
 so
 we're going to bring her hands
 elbows are lifted shoulders are dropped and there's a slight break at the wrist
 beautiful natural dancers everybody so nice and then
 we're going to bring her hand into the street.
and out into nausea
 we're going to start every time we stretch our legs we're going to
 so
 recluse
 then the left hand turn
 and the clothes
 stop
 okay let's try that with the hands and the feet
 and I believe this will be our last portion so after this and we can take
we'll talk about the oven a portion which to me is where all the magic happens
 okay so we start with Adam Monday
 2nd Street
beautiful
 very nicely done okay so if you need to go ahead and get a sip of water
 and then let's rearrange ourselves so that we can
 sit down in front of our device
okay beautiful
 in the NACA shastra which is the
 the book
 about their estimating about 2,000 years old which is where all the classical dances of India get their source
 in the NACA shastra there's a burst
which
 was always used when I was younger to remind me to use my eyes can you hear me I think maybe I have to turn this
 okay how's that is that better
 okay thank you
 so you might have noticed that while we were doing the knock yet the the knot that are taboo
 well we were turning our hand you might have noticed that each time I turned my hand my eyes would turn and I would look at the hand and then when I would turn my head back straight my eyes would go straight to the eyes are actually a big part of event the 90
and it's almost that the eyes are what takes the dance from the purely physical place to a deeper place and that's demonstrated in this verse in the nausea
 so it says your toe has done that old Thrifty wherever the hand goes the eyes follow so if you ever see a a better than I can performance you might notice that the denser will do
 who sings the song the song it is pretty much a rule of thumb that that wherever the hand goes I will always follow
 and it is because in the next line of the verse
I told Christy that told Mona wherever the eyes go
 the Mind follows
 so it's a way of attaching yourself your mental self to the movement it's not purely a physical movement is attaching your mental self to the movement
 so you throw hasta wherever the hand goes that sells loose tea that I follow the Mind follows wherever the Mind goes then the emotion comes so then now we're accessing a deeper part of our self our emotional self
 and then you told them that Odessa which is the ultimate wherever the emotion goes then comes the the side which is the flavor
 and we know it.
philosophy The Rusted is that unique flavor that we can find only in our relationships it's only through relationships that we understand and we know that there are different ways of having a relationship with Krishna right there's about the size of baby synchronise your child there is suck you sing Krishna as a friend. As the almighty and I am the servant and there is midoriya R Us as being Christmas of love her so those are all dressed up as
 and they are slavers in which we get to interact with someone that's the beauty of Buffy because it's never stagnant it's always exciting and it's always flavorful so that demonstrates how the dance moves from
early physical
 and aesthetic movements to something deeper that's igniting mood of feeling of a relationship within our hearts as we can use dance to connect and to have a relationship with divinity
 so that being said I would like to talk about the different dresses so in our bhakti philosophy there are 12 dresses 12 different ways that we can
 that we can interact or different ways that we can have a relationship and invited him there are nine and on a superficial level these are taught as just nine emotions
 and that's the way that I learnt them they're nine different emotions but then upon digging deeper in learning more about the philosophy am I funder stood
but these actually have a deeper origin nine different flavors of interacting with
 with either other devices or with Vitamix, the Super Soul
 Okay so
 these each are taught with a certain hand gestures so that we can learn how to
 depicts its kind of an aid to learn how to depict the emotion
 however the emotion itself is what is the most important not to hand gesture the hand gesture can change so we'll go through these and I invite you to try and
 evoke the emotion from within
 and and then utilize the hand gesture
as an expression of God
 so the first one
 9 * 1200 yes this is true I like that that's true there
 so the first one will do is Shane got them which is love and the typical way that we express love and guards are not him we take this McGraw
 from the heart
 and it opens out into the switch is on the Buckman
 so any in your welcome to close your eyes here whatever you feel whatever you feel drawn to
 the hand gesture is a way of expressing of a way of showing that but ultimately what's inside what is invoked as you do the hand gestures what's important
and love is so there's so many different ways of showing love typically Shane got it refers to conjugal love
 so often times it's done with a certain if it's a if it's a dense peace about
 about rata talking to her friend about the tender love she feels for Krishna it's sometimes paired with a little bit of shyness
 right so it's all it's all very steeped in that cultural
 expression which is it's very subtle it's very subtle so love them
 the next one is
or laughter
 so we typically showed him away our our husband with but DACA over the mail and
 sometimes person dies does really really funny things really silly things right so our reaction
 or sometimes if if I'm doing a piece on let's am performing a piece where the character is Yeshua. Christian is mother and she sees that he's up to so much nonsense and she's really really upset with him because she keeps on having to deal with the other gobies complaints
 and she really really gets angry at him but at the same time she can't help laughing because the things that she he does are just so cute and so funny
she might go
 but she has to cover her face because she doesn't want him to see her laughing right so this is hassium
 is Corona and Corona is compassion as most of us know
 and cutting that in relation to Krishna
 the the residence of vrindavan
 they have no idea that Krishna is Almighty all-powerful omnipotent omnipresent they don't see him that way at all so one person gets hurt or when he is seemingly in danger the immediately become so compassionate toward him right when Krishna went into
 the the yamuna river because all of the boys had drank the water and they had
Poison by khaliah The Serpent and Krishna immediately he said okay I'll take care of it and he jumped in and everybody was terrified right all the gopis were terrified and immediately felt so much compassion for him because they thought he was going to be hurt so
 Corona
 the hand gesture that we typically used because it helps to pick this is and this is applicable more to today's modern everyday Society is compassion toward animals because it's something that easy for easier for us to relate to so if you can show a cow with one hand
 and then
 Savannah
 compassion
 the next one is
children anger right this is this is Medicine Hat when when he came to save his devotee from the other finger so we use this
 these two fingers tucked under and these fingers like like almost like you're showing a little raisin or something
 this is Collingwood limited unless we hold extra eyes
 Haltom singer
 you'll open your eyes as big as you can
 anger
 the next of the Restless is Vida for
 a certain sense of pride
 it is a characteristic of the the chest day of class or The Warriors to have
Vita in order to present themselves in front of their
 there
 people that they rule
 citizens
 the kingdom
 Vita can be shown how does it matter which typically not not really not really with some things that does with all of these it can be either one
 and actually I I invite you all to unmute your mics if you want to because we I'm happy to have this Tia discussion if you want to
 if you wanted to pick up whenever you like sovita is is pride so but not boastful Pride it is one might have beer I even
 I do not have felt a sense of Vita as having Krishna himself is his
charioteer there's so much pride in knowing that Krishna is my friend and it's not boastful it's not
 it's not excessive Pride it is it's good price though Aveda can be shown with this much d
 often say that, is the embodiment of Vida he carries himself in a certain way
 and then by Young or fear
 so
 sometimes there is fear in certain pastimes right and certain stories I'm back to notice if he was his form was terrifying
the even the demigods even King in jet he was afraid to come and give him a Garland because his form was so ferocious so that that is there at can be there with certain forms
 Cedar Falls or disgust
 so in terms of the dresses that we can experience in krishna's pastimes there are times where it may be in a very gruesome fight
 if Christian is fighting a demon it can be it can be very graphic right and so that got you motion might be brought about okay but I don't want to see it right they might have felt this way
if if they ever saw Krishna killing one of the Demons right so there's a little bit of that be but some but the way I learned this is more of a on the Earthly plane of being disgusted with something actually disgusting so the way that we learnt it was he hold up so you use this
 you print to pretend like you're holding up something
 like a dirty sock or something or the hair from the dream
 yeah exactly so well then yes to be bought some or disgust
 and then there's a bottom
 are all the materials used in the dense each time are they stupid yes so I wish it would be
if we had like 3 hours to go through all of this because though the mood dress themselves all the materials that I've shown you this far are they are part of Byzantium they each have a name they each have a number of uses they each have they even each have a presiding person like a personality behind each one and they each have a color and a particular planet that they are linked to the the theory of this runs very very deep so each one of these has says these are called the awesome you've got hazardous single-handed gestures and they can all be found in the original text of the nagas Shasta
 and there's 26 of these single-handed gestures and then there's a series of of double-hand adjusters and then well I don't think we have time to go through all of them
 I can
well yeah I don't think
 does everyone feel okay with staying overtime like 15 minutes 15-20 minutes if if you would like to I'd be happy to see that we have a little more time to go through things and then what my little surprise for you at the end is I want to teach you a verse from the shoe mud bogging to come in with stress so that it can help us deepen our understand okay
 so yes to answer your question let me pull up your question again are all the materials used in the density Trend in terms of depicting the the nether S's
 it doesn't have to be the same with us so if we're doing discussed it can be done like this it can be done like this it can be done like this it doesn't really matter which method you used
but the guess these murders are specific they they are known for does use all of his mother has but the other classical Styles also use them so Odyssey which is a classical style from the north eastern part of India it also uses the same with dress with a slight variation
 so I put down or a surprise we we typically use this to show surprise it's kind of like a a Clap into an apartment
 and often this is used to just show the the Wonder the magnitude of of krishna's
 Leila's of his pastimes right.
 And it's almost in a way to say that like
 they can try
he even be described like what what can I even say to describe these these beautiful pastime
 and then the last one is shunted us which is complete peace so you might take your hands in invite the Natomas called Huns Asia or and you'll go we call a few just take that you can either place like this your hands at your chest
 so this is the the mood of the yogis
 it's almost the dip most difficult to express because its absence of emotion it is purely neutral purely piece
 okay so those are the never left us
 and let's go through the trials
we'll do it a little bit quickly in the all of the single-handed and the double hand gestures
 and we can do those together
 so we start with the first one but DACA the DACA means flag
 maybe I'll do one of the one use of each Madrid so that so that we can still go through them but then you can get a little contacts so that DACA can be used to show a flag
 the second one is tripitaka
 tripitaka can be used to show in a crown
 and this is often how Indra is depicted because he's the king of the heavens
 so he's the one with the biggest crown is opposed
ardipithecus
 is a canoe used to show a sword
 so and then we can couple a couple this with the with the rest of Aveda
 the hand gesture and the facial expression yes
 Garth adimakal
 which this is such a beautiful in the dry cuz it in so many ways can just described krishnas beautiful qualities in his eyes
 hair
 this shows things which are kind of crooked right topsy-turvy so you're always looking side-to-side the hair his hair which is so beautiful and curly then also his character sneaky sneaky
never going just straight but always
 Irving always
 being sneaky and mysterious
 mayura which is a peacock and we know Krishna has a peacock feather in his hair
 and you can say can make it shiver in the wind or we can take the peak out and we can become the peacock and
 sure Southern
 are there Chandra are there children literally means Half Moon so see the crescent moon in the sky are the gender
next we have a dolla
 my favorite used for Adela is elephant ears
 we can show up at the Ganesha using Ariana
 trunk
 elephants will pick up water and then
 right baby themselves a little shimmy
 Ariana next we have sugar to knucklehead
 which is a sphere
 musty
 which we can use to show vetem Pride or we can also use to show a promise
 she cut up the next one which literally means the mountain peak is also used to show a man
or writing or smile
 capito
 it's a little parrots
 see the parents
 give her some tail feathers
 champeta
 next we have got the gum okay which we used in our homie for them and its use for all kinds of futility things still putting on a necklace
 tying tying something
 succi succi literally means needle and seat used to show teaching
 like if the glue is giving a teaching of William
or to show one or two show no no
 Kendra color which is the sliver of the Moon just the Crescent Moon
 bud mekasha
 is microtia can be used to show
 holding something like holding a fruit but then also to show like a month a demon
 for the and we'll learn this one soon but the Mane of a lion
 so this is Tim home okay and then you put but moknowshair behind it and it becomes a lion
 start position
any guesses what distance
 Cypress Station
 negotiation
 negotiation and this is one of my favorite was it us because what we get to do it this isn't a car right hand
 keep your fingers pointing outward take your left hand same thing but keep your fingers pointing inward
 and bring them both to your right hand side
 if I'm your mirror it'll be like this
 I'm your man so Sophie take this hand and bring it on the inside and then you got it yes perfect and then you have Krishna Krishna Institute
 and of course are many different ways of showing krishna's flute because
right so he has a venal he has a bum c
 can't think of anymore right now but there are many different names for Christmas was so it might be showing like this and might be shown with got too, if it's a very long flute sometimes
 maybe he's waiting for the cows so depending on which flute he's using he uses them for different things so maybe he's waiting for the caliph uses his bump seat for sure which one he has for what but it might use his long flute
 short flute and then this is the most common way to show Krishna
 negotiation team, which we briefly this is a a deer or a cow
 my dog a mammal
Angela which is a little bit tricky tricky but you're going to roll your index finger in and then
 all the other fingers around it so this is going to be Bells
 or it's something small like gems and jewels
 and it can also be done done like this like we did the wrong with them that's also come either two fingers or one finger but if you have a cow and you want to show your cow with a cowbell
 call Angela
 how to say them in order I'd like to forget One's next
 Anna Padma is a fully bloomed lotus flower on the Padma so we'll use this for love we also can
has to show beautiful
 beautiful or this is can also be beautiful
 your face is like a blossom lotus flower I love both my checks do do we use this in our brain we pronounce right
 touching the Earth do I have to do.
 Then cameras driver which is a b
 so the
 index finger is rolled up in the middle finger and thumb are closed
 the Modesto area which means a swan
 this is
little head feathers and and and this can be used in to show like gal with diet and meditation or it can be used to show writing or to show someone you like I'm warm or bending many different ways from Sasha so we had to do a cashier's check and now we have pumps that function all different sounds of the oceans and this can be used to show people
 any people or if you if you hold it here down then it's a child
 and if you hold it at your arm level then it's a friend and if you hold it here then it's a. An elder well
 Humsafar Humpty dum dum show is right
lights
 or
 feeling it can also describe an emotion
 of wonderment
 and I'm sure
 and then we'll coolest rival just this keeping it closed it can be a mouse
 know that Ganesha his vehicle is a mouse right so mooshika vahana that's how we do music.
 Google, Judah is another type of bird
 but it is also used to depict a young girl if you hold it like this depicting a young girl because it's showing her
simple
 I'm going to try that and then last one is three Shula Trident were showing three
 so we'll skip the the double-handed gestures just because there's not a ton of time but just know that there's also double hand gestures those ones where the sing I would like to
 because this is the part I'm most excited about and I want to make sure we have time for it
 I
 I would like to share how we can use these murderous and facial expressions and everything we've learnt from today's class to apply it to a first into mud bog with them and I chose to versus that for anyone who's been listening to wisdom of the sages will be
familiar with its that to invocation versus and then the second one messed up face you
 so
 let's start with the first one
 now that I am no idea so the first line not I am the most insane I offer my obeisances on 290 who is the the Supreme most personality right sew in
 invite them. Then we have a hand gesture that is already they already depicts not I am so we have this very rich vocabulary and that's almost like sign language in a way that we can utilize these hand gestures to depict somebody
 but what I would like to encourage you
is that not just because just because the hand gesture depict the thank you Leslie
 just because the hand gesture depicts the person or the or the emotion sometimes we think oh well all I all I need to do is use my hands and then I'm conveying that message which is true in a sense but it's still important to convey it from within with a emotion with a thought right with a prayer so the hand gesture be used to depict not item is this
 tripitaka and it's that the hands are in front of the chest okay so that is already a different depiction of not I know but what I invite you to do is think about okay bishnu what do I know about Vishnu
 he is the source of all the universes right
so I know that there is this
 when I think about Vishnu
 what emotion is called upon in that might be different for each of us
 but how do I bring that out in in this hand gesture so I just invite you to think about that so not I am
 the next line is I offer my respectful obeisances so we can bring her hands all the way there now
 and then the next line is not a shaver Naruto mom
 sonada and Richie who
 are the super most human being NADA and not I know which is something I still don't fully understand but somehow they're the same person she so the next line will show Human Being Human or men and then Super most soyuz
we went back a little bit you you turn your hands up so from here so here and the emotion that were thinking of invoking is
 super most right
 so let's do that from the beginning
 and I must scream
 gnetum Chavis

 I offer my respects my respectful obeisances to Nada en su Nota and I see who's the super most human being and then the next line is Dave and set us with him
 the goddess of learning so
 if you see a picture
so we depict status with you holding a Veena so with your I'll do I'll be your mirror so that you can copy me so take your left hand and bring it to me I guess your left hand and hold it at an angle right above your shoulder
 and then the other hand takes to G

 this is the means by which we can conquer our ourselves
 in order to direct ourselves

 Nestor play issue of hydration
 so the first line is says anything that is inauspicious becomes destroyed so we use like it's like sushi but bring your thumb like this
 and this is what we used to show inauspicious and it can be it can be paired with a facial expression
yeah those things which get in the way with try and pop are Bubble Witch try and create
 impurities in the heart right inauspicious so
 Nesta player shoe anything that's in auspicious
 becomes destroyed so we can think of destroyed us this is one way to show destroyed is almost like dissolving to ashes and then at the end
 exactly

 Nikki ombak about that Save-A-Lot by regularly offering service to bhagirath means always more regularly and then one way that we show it's a Sim Sim
