 what's good news and announcements Mika stupid Mara we're going to India this year we want to go to India going to Sacred pilgrimage it's happening and we're going to so many good holy places go still. Going to pour a new die born Akbar reisek Ace Hardware and go over downhill so excited to go to bring the oven and go over done and specs had to do with you because we haven't been on pilgrimage together like me to really going into places in many many years we would last time was 2000
 in the year 2000
cuz we went to Jaipur a diamond together at that time it was too, not even that but that was we just went to two places this is like we're going on a whole Magical Mystery Tour to really experience these holy places cuz you do with people that explain them you sit there you contemplate them the understand how to enter a holy River and your Holy Temple meeting holy people show us the way right now
 show me the light anyway it was when I was 22 I first went to holy places and I bowed someday I will bring people here because I had such a positive experience and I'm so honored that I get to do that to my favorite thing I do all year all right buddy whole new chapter of the shoe my bag with Tom
for that before that we have an idea
 I have and what are you we got today it's kind of you know I just got caught up and reading something this morning
 and so I never found the Nugget but then I said this could be the Nuggets today
 but it's going to try and because what we're going to read we're getting right down to it recognize we heard pearlized teachings to his friends and those teachings are going to infiltrate the whole school like all the kids are going to be truths there's always some people who don't want to hear that you're going to find that even though you're feeling like I'm part of a great philosophy here great lifestyle and never do this when you first got in the Bakke like this is so great
 and all of a sudden you get Maha push back from people but the kids were into it that was a thing the Box
but in this chapter heat your honey Kashi Pooh's going to hear about it and he's not going to be happy the teachers were like just like this one kid and now he's like turn all the other kids on to this we're going to be in big trouble so they go and they tell her and you guys should really tell poor lad's father and he's just he's so curious and he's going to ask a question
 2 / lot
 cuz you know the teachers these are like
 really high level is super intelligent brilliant influential people
 they're terrified
 then then you got even other rulers of other planets that are terrified
 of her Auntie Tasha Pooh. It's just right in his very humbly he's got his he's got his palms folded and he standing there gently but
drop of fear
 I think it's safe to say posing him you know
 I think it's safe to say as we advanced in bhakti are anxiety or fear diminish cuz you start to get to this point well
 how can you hurt me don't you understand that we only know how this check bookends Godwin's light winds truth wins so he's units oh so Orange Crush become so frustrated and angry is is where do you get your power how do you how are you able to not be terrified of me
 and Palatka just answer
 I got my power from the same place you get your power for myself right anybody else that's so this is it it I tie this into a interviewer so I got to look this up maybe
can you look up Brian Cox Cox
 I I saw a little bit like a 10-minute clip of an interview with John Joe Rogan with this scientist Brian Cox he's like he's kind of like the new Popular Science to start there's a young guy
 he looks like he could be like in a band or something like that you know like he could be in like a palpable.
 I wasn't worried about him he's an English physicist and musician with a professor of particle physics in the school of physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester and the Royal Society Professor for public engagement in science okay so he's the Royal Society Professor for the public engagements I guess that kind of means like he's like a it meant to be like a face or representative of signs to the popular world and he does it well you know he's kind of like he's like an alternative to do you know guys like
Hitchens who's just like I'm incredibly pompous and I'm like ridiculously everything that you picture like a pump is British you snob I not only and that I embrace it and I hate you or somebody stodginess I'm going to be a server or physicist is guys cool it could be like in because I had a Smashing Pumpkins or something and I'll Grant him this that he's he's he's respectful you know like let like some like Hitchens and Dawkins they just Mock and spit on and just you know like that they're there their nasty where is Brian Cox I can see he's like more of a gentleman you know and I appreciate that but he said things that in this interview cuz I saw the headline was
it was something like Brian Cox denies the existence of the Soul has check it out so Joe Rogan interviewing him so let's read what he says that any it here's a point and we've gone to this point before
 what I see
 and a lot of these popular some people call them like religious atheist right like religious in the sense that their signs becomes a religion and placing faith in and they kind of loser objectivity
 you know he seems like a nice person and I'm sure he's very brilliant you know but it seems to me like he's lost his objectivity
 you know if you're that you fear like the Royal Society of what was it called again ran the Royal something of science
 Grand poobah of the Royal Society Professor for public engagement in science what is I need a tie
I'm sure there was a ceremony to or you received the quote some kind of metal on a summon and I've got that. You know you if you're going to be that person and you're going to go on base practically the largest
 media platform that exists you know
 we would hope that you have very cool you can very clearly
 explain and defend your views
 and when I heard what he was saying it seemed to me like just in the simplest ways your
 you're not really getting to the point of your subverting going around becoming diverted and it's intimidating to the common person I think to hear someone speak cuz he's going to throw out the words and Concepts that I don't even understand so okay you can just knows more than me right but you can also if you just look at it simply do you have to answer a simple question and if you avoid that
he has to address the question until it lets get into what he says so
 let's see where we start here
 it begins with a conversation about conscious and she says we don't know what Consciousness is it is often called A Hard problem in science we don't know so it's a good question and then he starts to see like whether you could build a self-replicating machine which is what you're talking about. I'm not sure where they were going earlier in the conversation but he's he's kind of equating a self-replicating machine with a conscious being more conscious life so it's a good question whether you could build a self-replicating machine cuz right that's what we are all the human human Humanity are all the different species we're all these incredible self-replicating conscious machines with intelligence and emotions and so on like that
so could you create that you know who could you create this thing and it could go to the moon or Mars and replicate itself and then Carry On which is a living thing I suppose it right there you come on and you're the Royal Grand poobah of science you suppose and then gyro says yes so they says does it have a sufficient level of intelligence to be conscious
 we all understand that that's that's right there who says that like the love the level of sophistication is intelligence mean like its ability to calculate
 is that what Consciousness is or is consciousness something that you feel right like you have an abacus and then you have like a simple calculator and then you got a more advanced computer at what point does it become conscious now the yogis of ancient India said never is never conscious is just a more sophisticated calculator
right right why are you making this assumption does it have a sufficient level of intelligence to be conscious
 you have to you have to defend that idea and you have it right choices we all understand what you can to find is that emergent property not just the word emergent
 is loaded because you're saying is it doesn't exist at some point and then it emerges out of matter right like they've got it actually backwards it's entirely back just like you're trying to figure something out from the outside where is the Baton teacher something from the inside just going to feel your way around and try to figure out how to use this thing animated you know
 yeah it's it's an end you know what I don't have a problem with his belief that Consciousness emerges out of matter but what I have an issue with is that he's going to say one is for
in one is science you he's got faith
 that that that that that Consciousness arises out of matter he can't prove it but he's speaking as this this is signs this is not based on faith we're going to see whether it's based off a threat so let's let's continue he says I don't know he says we all understand what you can to find a steady merging property that has to emerge you got something that's intelligent enough to replicate itself and live and run personal you don't have that science has never produced that I don't know the answer but it's worth considering that this thing with emotion meaning love and fear and all those things
 are just the things that happen when you are intelligent like a zit to say intelligent enough where your level of the sophistication of your ability to calculate reaches a certain level and then you have emotions and you have loved this absolutely zero proof of this they can't produce it they can't make it there's not even a really any reason to think
that even make sense right okay so this is Joe Rose his right and then he continues I don't know the answer to that the cabinet is always that we don't know it's just not understood
 but then he says this that he makes his claim he says it's physical though I'm damned sure it's physical there goes guesswork taught as fact exactly he say Kenny is it again I'm sure I'm damn sure that there's nothing going on in my head other than what is allowed by the laws of nature as we understand them
 answer The Joe Rogan says so limiting the woo you mean and I think what it means by Woo is like anything you can't perceive and very mystical yes sir so eliminating the woo you mean the idea that the soul being being some sort of divine thing that's inside the housing of the body okay that's exactly what the sages of ancient India teacher so so
foxes
 he says yeah I mean I know he says I know then he backs down just a bit I would say
 he seems pretty right yesterday since I know I would say we can rule that out actually I've argued against that in the past so as he said he's damn sure they said he's known I was saying I would say I've argued in the past OK Google it outright how do you rule out that Consciousness is a Divine spark of spiritual energy situated within the caijing of a material how do you rule that out
 okay and I'm going to do my best with this because I I didn't edit this yet so I didn't because it said I'm taking it from the transcript of the night so I'll do my best to represent exactly what he said and added it as I read he says I have argued that we can rule that out in the following manner okay so here's my arm right
so it's made of electrons and protons and neutrons and if I have a soul in there something we don't understand but is a different kind of energy or whatever
 why say whatever right when you say that you just trying to make it sound silly right but no that's what they're saying it's a different kind of energy that operates according to different laws that there was a time
 you don't get a century ago
 where there were laws of physics that were just assumed could explain everything
 and in the most brilliant scientists discovered that within the atom
 it seems like there's a whole different set of laws of physics in there that was called quantum physics and all kind of crazy things that would never seem possible were suddenly possible
 right so
is it was kind of like better play into a battery so he's saying that my arm is made out of protons and neutrons and electrons in if I have a soul in there something that we don't understand but it's some kind of some different kind of energy or whatever
 it is this we don't have in physics at the moment it interacts with matter because at this is why I wish I would had time to take it that it is is I'm moving my hand around so whatever it is something that matter interacts very strongly with matter okay whatever is conscious is interacting very strongly with matter is what he say that he said that if there is that the soul is interacting very strongly with matter yes it is the history of particle physics
 in particular
which is a study of matter we've spent decades making high-precision measurements
 a bar
 and we've making high Precision measurements of the behavior how these behaviors and how these themes interact how they behave how matter behaves and interacts and we look for it
 what we're looking for what is that conscious element what what what is a merging right weave look for it
 we spent decades making high Precision measurements of the behavior in the interactions we look for it for example for 5th force of nature
 so we know that there's a force of gravity there two nuclear forces called the weak and the strong nuclear forces there's electromagnetism so these are four forces
 and that's what we know exists
 and we look for another one with ultra
Precision okay cuz she said the point right now because try to keep your attention and we know of four forces and we've been looking for a fifth one with our ultra-high precision and we don't see any evidence of it so I would claim that we know how matter interacts with these Energies
 we know how matter interacts very precisely and now listen carefully so if you want to suggest that there's something else that interact with matter strongly
 then I would say that that's ruled out because we look so and carefully for it right I would go so far as to say it's it's been ruled out by experiments or at least
 it's extremely subtle
 and you have to jump through a lot of Hoops to come up with a theory of some stuff that we wouldn't have seen when we observed how matter interacts
is there is no how matter interacts with what is present in our body so he went from saying I'm damn sure it's physical to saying well would have to be very subtle and you have to come up with a really good explanation you know now if we go to the bug of agita bug of agita 342 the working senses are superior or more subtle than don't matter the mind is more subtle than the senses the intelligence is still more subtle than the mind and he the soul
 is still higher or more subtle than the intelligence now if you go to bug of agita 13/16 it says the soul in here the song Super Soul exists outside and inside of all living beings the moving in the non-moving because he is subtle ships mabat six months.
is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know what kind of wanted to go to no prob.
 Crock-Pot Natick Masters they respect people's intelligence but probably gives even the smartest people a title which immediately takes away the Royal the beautiful title that that physicists. Which was probably caused them speculators are speculating and putting forth as perhaps a truth or a damn sure I'm damn sure and then and leading with that but in reality is and look I'm no genius we know that I've been called dumbass Stone okay but suppose me and this guy are laying on our backs in a few
and we are looking up in the sky and we're seeing a 747 flying overhead and as smart as he is
 we still have no clue at all what is this thing but before we suppose we don't know What airplane is what is it a syncline is it some type of bird is it first of all our sensors are limited we can barely see it we just see that there at night and there might be some lights but we just see this thing flying and even if we could extend our eyes with a telescope even if we could build that we still might have an idea what's going on we we may not forget it ideal that people are inside and then there's actually a driver of this machine and this is where we are in materials material sign all we can do is guess is this thing of bird is this thing a spaceship or an alien spaceship is what is going on and weak
gas and gas and gas but there is a limit to our senses are sensors are limited we have to understand that and the easiest way to understand that I bring it right back to hear every time if there is a bug on my computer even though he's right next to me he does not have the senses to understand who I am and that we're having a podcast and I'm looking around all over the place I was like and I'm trying to tell the Buckhead we're doing a podcast right now the bugs will never understand the podcast it's Way Beyond he's not he'll never figure it out it's beyond his senses so we might speculate we might be able to really really intelligent and he could still never get it it's no big deal we get it we are tiny we're finite there is a limit to Material Science because we have limited senses and we can have perfect knowledge with imperfect senses it says other is where bug like
 we're both like and that's okay
but when the bug starts making like statements of fact and teaching them and pushing them forward pushing them as fact that's a problem right and end and here's what I'm saying the objectivity is lost right later on in that interview Joe Rogan's going to say
 after he continues to make his arguments that there's no such thing as some spiritual element
 he's going to say to release it but for whatever reason for people there's some incredible motivation to Define to find a Divine something or other that there's something greater than his physical being there's something what do you why do you think why is there that compulsion in people so he's he's saying okay I'm buying into your at least for the time being I'm buying into your explanation which he didn't explain
they said we'd look for it we haven't found it any single why do people why are they so bent why are they why do they have this compulsion what it what is it what psychological motives what you know what is clouding their objectivity but really want to just flip that the other way there's no objectivity and objectivity write like I'm going to this without any bias and I'm looking and I'm and I'm just good and he's saying I damn sure what you're not damned sure I mean how can we even say we're even sort of sure if you really want to do I think even with what we do I always I would start with like well The Vedas teach this and it could be like this once you start to say is definitively like this
 that's a problem but I feel like we are bugs just trying to like
 figure out the universe and then and then present them and are they Wayne and re goes behind them
we can say no I'm definitely like this with myself and I study all this stuff I can say this Krishna exists he could exist because there are practices of faith that actually tangibly work in my life meditation control the senses Rising early all these processes do I know Christian is a blue little Cowherd boy I don't know he could be in the absolute truth the source of everything could be people have been on this path before me have had that realization do I have that realization know but I'm continuing on this path and as I move on this path I noticed more and more things are manifest to me as I step a Little Closer
 and that's honest honest I'm not presenting it like that but even faith-based process b a
there's a secret process it's a realization a practical realization based process where you're moving forward and then things get revealed to you in time
 and what we're saying to you know we've used this example like say you had someone applying the same type of thinking
 is Brian Cox's to like say studying the the Mona Lisa we taken out of microscopes we've analyzed what it's made out of weave look we we know with all kind of Precision Instruments what what's a canvas was made out of even though it's you know centuries-old and then we know the exact pigments and we we can break it down and tell you exactly things people could have told you years ago with our instruments now we can tell you exactly what the pigments of this painting were made of and we've looked and we've looked and looked and we've seen no evidence of a painter
you're not going to see the painter with that and how you going to find out someone's going to tell you it's through testimony that you're going to find out who painted that that's our thing we're saying there are text handed down by the stage is that our testimonies 2 to 200 standing what Consciousness is and you can experiment with them you know there's a couple things around it purports at 13 chapter so great and these are towards the end of the 13 chapter but they speak exactly to this conversation text 1333 says the sky due to its subtle nature does not mix with anything although it is all-pervading
 Simile this all situated in Brahman does not mix with the body though situate in the body you can look with all your Intimates you're not going to find it even though it's there and then probably right in the, Teresa's
 he says the at the air enters into water mud stool or whatever else is there still it does not mix with any
simile the living entity although situated in varieties of bodies is aloof from them due to his subtle nature therefore it is impossible to see what the materialized how the living entity is in contact with his body that's exactly how he's doing well there's some contact with matter so you know
 and how he is out of it after the struction the body no one in science can ascertain this and then it and then just let me read this this is a commentary to the last verse of the 13 chapter thirteen thirty-five Progressive one can understand that this body is matter he can be analyzed with its 24 elements there are scientists back of these these sages were signed as they're breaking down the element to the body
 I'm the body is a gross manifestation and the sub manifestation subtle again right is the mind and psychological effects and the symptoms of life
are the interaction of these features but over and above this there's the soul
 and the interaction of these there's a salt and there is also the super soul the soul in the super solar to this material world is working by conjunction of the soul and the 24 material elements one who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the sole material elements and can also see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual World these things are meant for contemplation just what you're saying right these things are meant for contemplation and then for realization in one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual Master if there are other approaches to try to understand these questions and you can go see where some other famous comment commentators on this same point maybe you've heard of shell
the band shelter shelter had in defense of reality because spiritualists get a fuse to be accused of being woo woo they get accused of being a running away from reality
 so we said actually their conclusions prove their Insanity a creation without a Creator and it'd be just like a painting without a painter absurdity no I don't want to run away I want to embrace reality shelter circuit 1993 and let's hear what a lot is going to speak to we are on chapter is exciting I told you I'm going to be right before he said nasheema Drogba Tom
 which is very needs a conquest when should I be expecting a basin cease to the Supreme Lord and Ryan on 29 and reach you this year most human being until Mother's Day
watch the goddess of learning today of the author messed up radiation of Audrey Sue Mitcham bug about Save-A-Lot bag of it by regular Tennessee classes in Bogota Man by rendering service a tube Elias all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact oh my God that's a lot of knowledge I have no business he's at their Lotus feet 7 chapter 8 test 1
 and this is called lord of string a day of slaves the king of the Demons here it's called
 The Ataris stands up he speaks truth because he's realized and all of a sudden you're going to get
back from the material world is going to happen to everybody here you going to be inspired and you're going to get pushed back is what happens when God Saves the Day not a money continued all the sons of the Demons right there we all getting reach to all the sons of the Demons appreciated the transit until instructions of her a lot more and took them very seriously they rejected the materialistic instructions given by their teachers Sunda and a marker was Sunday in the mark of the sons of supercharged I observe that all the students the sons of the Demons or becoming Advanced and Krishna Consciousness because of the association with prolonged Maharaj they became afraid there's a Revolution going on in the school there's an encampment going on with this with the students at the Run cashew Pooh High School
 they approached the king of the demons and described the situation as it was the teachers are worried
yeah
 100 Pikachu pillow understood the entire situation
 the rebellion of the students he was extremely angry so much so that his body trembled thus he finally decided to kill his son Todd has really triggered yeah as a trigger
 Renny koshy poop was by Nature very cruel and feeling assaulted he began his sing like a snake trampled upon by someone's foot is Sun prologue was peaceful mild gentle which probably makes you even hissed you stood before her any cash you play with folded hands according to provides age and his behavior he was not to be chastised yet with staring crooked eyes runny cashew Pooh rebuked him with the following her
words
 he's running as you feel most impudent most unintelligent disrupter of the family-owned lowest among mankind you have violated my power to rule you and therefore you are obstinate fool today I shall send you to the place of your Mirage
 kill them and put them in front of the judge death like
 it's kind of like the scientist like that you know they like these atheistic scientists like we believe that there's laws young get it that there's a system out there we just don't like any idea that there's a person behind it that we are there any way inferior to that we anyway or depended on that we're anyways submissive to with that
we don't like and it's that a version which in my mind I'm saying that's what's causing objectivity but it is yeah the whole system without Dharma works and there's laws in the universe I'm going to manipulate manipulate more power you know when I am angry all the planets in the three worlds Trimble along with their Chief rulers he's accepting that the planets have rulers OK power has a rascal like you become so impudent that you appear fearless and overstep my power to rule you writing someone kill someone and Lord over them and they're just not their particular because her running has put conquered the universe they're the people like Andrew worth
I hope people that you know wielding the Thunderbolt weapon and could unified entire armies on their own we're terrified of him the rule is a different planets were terrified of him and his little boy
 and he's completely composed and he's repeatedly contradicting him countering him doing it in the gentle manner where did how in the world are you the only person I can't seem to put in place what is it that you've got where is where is it coming from your ability to not be afraid of me
 and a lot he's going to say something that's just so insightful but still more infuriating this is text 7 provide said the source of my strength of what you're asking is also the source of yours indeed the original source of all kinds of strength is one
he is not only your strength or mine but the only strength for everyone
 without him no one can get any strength weather moving or not moving Superior inferior everyone including Brahma the Creator is controlled by the strength of the Supreme personality of godhead now if you feel like no I'm just going to climb this ladder and material success I'm getting stronger I'm going to bed or I'm going to Smart I'm getting more charismatic more and more people are thinking I'm cool if you hear about the Supreme personality this becomes a problem because it ruins your godship and yes I ate you see this happen with people that I think I told this story before that this person do my teacher training wants a great singer charismatic and like I signed up for training because I really love the fact that you could do to your tongue and your teacher training
and the more and more this person started hearing philosophy the more and more they started becoming unattracted to all these teachings because cuz when I realized was they don't want to sing to serve God they don't want to sing to glorify God they want to sing to be God they want to sing to be the center that that's what's behind their cure time they want to be a little mini eastern western Rockstar and that's a big problem bhakti we're not the rock stars we are glorifying the center not becoming the center I don't care if you're doing it with you know if your sim like hedge fund investor on Wall Street or if you sitting down with a harmonium if it's all about you
 that's what you're a life and if you see yourself as part of something bigger and you're here to serve the center that's spiritual life doesn't matter what outfit you wear
okay what job you had it so so when Joe Rogan said that you know so what do you think it is that makes people so compelled to think that there's got to be some soul within the body some spiritual element that's that science can't explain why do you think people so compelled you could just as easily flip it the other way and say why are people why are people so compelled to deny the possibility of the existence of another type of energy and what is it that's being triggered in them now here we see her Renny koshy Pookie's like top most material is the guy has risen to the top Concord everyone and he's just furious that anyone want to speak of his own son
 would would tell him right to his face that you are depending on someone else ultimately your week ultimately any you're asking me where I get my power from I get it from the same place you get your power from what are you talkin
I've got everything by my own hard work there's no rule out there right there's no something spiritual Beyond it is insulting to me and my own conception of my own dominance my own power who I am my own my own ego my own conception of who I am to think that I'm depending on anyone else is infuriating to me often be a disqualification to have this incredible you know of intelligence because from incredible any Incredible Gift can be an incredible source of ego and whenever there's ego information can't come in blockers remember those purple hearts and Prophet said more people like a chapter 7 I think he said actually they're not great scientist philosopher as you know that they're actually just
arrogant there are Vedic scientist there are Vedic philosophers that but with their great intelligence is a type of deep humility where they can hear and when you hear you can change yourself you can you can see things differently at you don't you're not trying to do not try to put forth your ego you're trying to get to the bottom of Truth anyway you can and even if it means admitting like you know what I thought I knew all this stuff I don't know that much and that way you invite in you invite information and you invite knowledge truth and spirit into your life you know
 that's that that's how you know where you kind of started running. Was this idea that you take these ideas and then you experiment with them right and you can you analyze them and you think about them and you consider them now what collages gave her money cuz she gave me something to think about
how do I get my power where do I get my power I got from the same place you get your power you are not an independent being a prophet is it she says in the commissary and this is what Sage is do the try to give you a macro to help you understand the micro you know the try to give you some some analogy and nature to help you and all I see the pattern okay so he says it wants these extraordinary strength or power anywhere it is derived from the Supreme personality of God had to give an example there different grades of fire but all of them Drive heat and light from the sun
 similarly all living entities big or small are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme personality of yarded right there the power of fire that we find in a log req except this again see the fire comes right out of here I said there's fire in that log there's there's energy in that log
is it get its where does it get its power against it from the Sun okay then you can find fire in its other forms and its gaseous forms or fire in it in other material forms right where do they where do they get their fire they also get it from the Sun and I did a little today to sign stay here on so this is sza from the national academies of Sciences engineering and Medicine you had a whole morning didn't you I did when when sunlight strikes a plant some of the energy is trapped through photosynthesis and is stored in chemical bonds as a plant grows
 as we can as of course we can recover that energy directly months or Years Later by burning the plant products such as wood wood breaks the bonds and releases the energy as heat and light it so the heating light is in there
 and when you break the bonds it comes back out
we use the stored energy of the Sun in the much more coke and much more concentrated forms that result when organic matter after millions of years of geological and chemical activity underground turns it into coal oil or natural gas so whether using coal oil natural gas would its all the energy of the Sun the power and all of them is coming from the same source of the wood were to say to do or where do you get your power from the same place you got it and try to see the you know that these patterns you know this is how things work we all have some power we have a power source suggests juices you know the RR fuels have it goes deeper
 because will you can say what what about
hydro hydro power write the sun heats the Earth's surface and the Earth heats the air above it causing wind water evaporates by the sun forms clouds and rain that give us flowing streams and rivers both wind and the flowing water hydropower are sources of energy so you see the sun is the source of many kinds of energy we find nature you know again it's goes back to the Sun so probably it's saying whether it's me or you or anyone else had Ava a demigod and animal plant where does it get its power it's all coming from the same Source that's what prahlada saying here think about it meditate on it contemplate on it and end in been practicing and see where this goes
 be open to it be open to the idea
 all right all right Miss Mara take this home
fear and anxiety diminish as we advanced in our spiritual life could you suffering severe anxiety I got some good news for you take baby steps forward and watch them diminish just half the soul is the most subtle of all are limited and imperfect we call it the subtle body right I was just the first that I'm damn sure doesn't exist and I said well if it exists is very subtle almost a plan like it's just too subtle to but it but from the beginning stages of saying this is subtle exact term in the field were looking up with that plane and we have a Source Who Says by the way this is a plane this is a it's made by you know it's made by man there's people in that plane there's a guy in the front that drives it we're just getting insight to what's going on if you're still not going to figure it all out
from this vantage point but I'm just going to give you some insight the betas are giving us that Insight that's that's that's all it's going on we understand there is a mind that subtle that's even sell them in the body then there's the intelligence in the ego and more so even more subtle and the Flying Machine it's not a faith-based process it's experience-based yep hear the testimonies don't just look at the painting for evidence of the painter said there was a painter just by looking at but yeah ultimately who would was thinking of creation without a Creator how can it be absurd to T
 you get inspired then you get pushed back and you're going to get some push back not everyone is going to opt-in you going to go home on Christmas
Society suckers run glorify God not be God
 that's why I was saying I talked to your tongue ego is a god blocker blocker I were God Blocker we Chicago the wood and the oil get their power from the same source and the service is me to go to that's okay that even that could be named as being one of the physicist need to brew from where the physicist
