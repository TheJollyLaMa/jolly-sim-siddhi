she said she heard the build that the crash
 and went downstairs
 and there was people banging on her door to get in
 and she was letting people in or just escape the debris and covered in Ash and Pikachu she lives like right on in my life but I'm saying like how she wasn't she was like a faithful or something but she came downstairs to the bike rumor before banging on the door if you let people in and then she went back up and took a nap and I woke up made pasta and they have evacuated her entire building she sort of slept through 911 had a good nap through 911 and then when she came back her whole building is abandoned the door commands abandoned everybody's gone and she packed a little bag of just started walking Uptown but my nephews and my nieces they want to school right there whatever it is PS whatever it is

 I admire this manager's ability to think and to write
 do you that sort of sounds like a nugget in itself as part of this man's ability thinking right right you right son interesting spiritual
 subjects where is this from this is from letter to a young German
 letter to a young German is it a book or is it just a letter I think it was a letter that got published until
find a book some kind of collection or something like that that's in the old days when people don't like a really good letters really thought about writing a text that it became just emojis I hate those it's not listen to a 6-minute Gigi I love you six minutes for I love you to death about 12 seconds
 it's like you want me to invest six minutes in this thing I don't put the thing when you write it on nice paper do you know when I was growing up you would see you know your letters with some like Wax ever tell you that he's right back at it again reminiscing about the past the truth your fascination with this is by the way by the way yesterday I was reminiscing about the horse thing
then I got a call and I got a call from Josh Reed triolo but she's like I love your Reminiscing on the horses today. I was like yeah that's a good point you spend so much time with her out of this town and now it's time to move on let's hear that that's the letter from The Young to the young German
 that was interesting what you just made me emails they just for a little bit more. You could be a little bit more informal you could bright LOL things like that then then tell LOL Kim probably with the text messages
 yeah but you didn't have to be asked formal with it was enough for sure knows for sure and then we'll text messages SMS is remember that when you have to like hit it three times to get one letter of the original text messages I don't remember that you do remember that was pretty Emoji was sort of like whatever 2008 cuz I don't have to make your own emojis
out of the Ya-Ya workers semicolon parentheses wake webmasters whoever created us everything you know what let's just make a heart damage has been dumbed down let's go back complicated language because it expresses so many subtle emotions and then as cultures devil language D balls and symbols
 and misunderstanding one another what did he mean by that and I love poop emoji young German right now let's hear what he has to say this is good we need to kind of like cleanse our mental palette right now and focus on this is important
 mental
it's good and each one of you there's a hidden being still in the deep sleeper childhood to life
 in each one of you there's a call he will an impulsive nature and impulse towards the future the new the higher let it mature letrozole nurture it your future is not this or that it is not the money or the power it is not the wisdom or the success at your trade is that it seems like if you can become a successful at your training right now know your future your hard dangerous path is this to mature and to find God in yourself it is not your success at your trade that's not what I'm used to weigh
stop in you seem like that is it I just got to get better under my business just has to get better if I can be on the top of my guess what there's people on the top of their game and business who get to that former like
 now what is it you know what we spoke about this before not that I want to give me any trouble I can but like that dumb you got them got them who documented Rihanna very popular documentary on Michael Jordan
 cycle whole series and I never saw it I forget what was it called
 The Last Dance maybe is that what it's called you know it really got into the last chance it really got into his hole over here right now, I will get just got into his life but it you know it was an excellent documentary really went behind the scenes and you really got to admire him on one level you know the determination
you know of this person the focus of this person or yeah you know that the Raw Talent of this person you know the strength of his will the time you got to put in to get to that not like Call of the womb doing that you got to work at that and then and then you enter this league and you're this young guy and then into their seats like Titans of the history is basketball out of your competitors and I you know you got to stand up to them and establish yourself and then lift your whole team up with you and you know there was that all of that
 and in one sense may be like if you just went out into the street and start asking people like give me one example of a person that just really embodied like the determination to be successful at I bet you know a lot of people say Michael Jordan you know you really feel it through that documentary I know nothing about him except the sneakers okay okay but but as
as that documentary progresses
 you know early on with your feeling primarily through it is like again that you know the challenge that he's facing the determination of his will and so on and then when he hits that high level of success the story becomes more about his own happiness within the elusiveness of it and largely due to the different related to do to his relationships and you know like what year did he has this one saying that keeps coming out there where it's like he's as I took that personal I took that personal like it's some kind of slide to him he says I took that for the usual he's playing out in like they needed came back in really destroyed them you know on the court right but you could see it in certain parts and he was tearing up where it's like his
 it it seemed like he almost had an unlimited ability to life
for the Tapas that was necessary to Excel and even on a professional basketball team not everybody had it on his level right and so he's pushing these guys and get nasty about it you know touchy that success and it's kind of in him
 you know it's really alive and him that that that sheer determination but he's hurting other people and hurting his relationship with other people to achieve that success
 and and and in the end you have the picture of a person that's really although they achieved all their dreams are really not happy that there's something internal that's really
 that's that's really problematic sure so silly as a character like
 well I think I'm going to talk I'm explaining that again I didn't go into that because you know upstanding person move to the drug problems or things like that I think it was in the gambling
but I think it's like the defects of character defect that was being highlighted was a kind of callousness towards others in in his in his striving for greatness in his striving for greatness and umrah so you an Indian always positive quality was that you know that that determination and that that focus and so on it's just their good qualities used perhaps a less than worthy thing I feel a basketball to make sound know it's very worth it but the idea is that we set the
 we set the market in another Direction so we're climbing High towards his greatness at ebony other expense and and I think a devotional service it's it's it's the way we treat ourselves the way we treat other people that is the Mark it's not in about a cheap mint it's about just doing your duty yeah you know you look at a guy like Magic Johnson I don't know if you know anything about him
he's also goes down as maybe not the Michael Jordan basketball maybe he doesn't want people to think the number one player they don't think of a Magic Johnson but they think of him as one of the greats but he lost but he comes off as a person that's got a very almost like loving nature you know like I think he's widely seen as just a kind person he doesn't have a bad word for anyone I know and it's still he was successful and there's nothing more wonderful when you see someone who's very very complex and they're very humble yeah that's a beautiful thing and somebody you know when I hear this from him and has is like a
 I think that as we go through you know who are our daily routines
 and the days you know on the calendar they just start you know you keep flipping the months to the calendar you know they just started disappearing it's hard not to just get stuck in the day today and this sounds to me like a call to
or that there's something more important underneath all of this what you're striving for don't limit it to these lower-level things remember that there's is the very purpose of life has to do with this Awakening of your spiritual nature don't neglect it. You have to keep reminding yourself that even though it's it's some
 I don't know if the femoral is right where but even though it seems like it's it's it's not practical or somebody to know it is the Practical thing it is a thing I have to focus on and there's there's a higher idea of what life is about and that hire idea of spirituality that we always have to keep in mind that we always have to carry it in the heart it always has to be there and has to be a live Houston keep that away quaking that up you know we look at we look at the example of prolonged here perladas the example of success that we can write it again this is how it's such a brilliant way
that Yas Yas Deva the name of the composer of all the Beyblades in the compiler of the the bog with him how he juxtaposes things he's always everything so thoughtful he's always carefully presenting things to make a point we just had a whole chapter all these different highly successful Universal figures offered prayers to Vishnu but the full Awakening of that spiritual nature wasn't present in all those prayers and you know it then but so but the person we Highline now say now we've a whole chapter prayers to provide who who's presented as the real success but he said he he's just a little boy he hasn't achieved what a lot of those other
 at those other offers of prayers have achieved but he's this inner spiritual Nature has entirely awake and him and his words become
found it more moving then the words of others and part of what you know if we're going to keep that let's see again how he said it he said each one of you there's a hidden being still that's what we would call that are sarupa right like the are real identity a real spiritual identity it's still in the deep sleep with childhood bring it bring it to life in each of you there's a call a will and impulsive nature and impulse toward the future the new the higher or theirs is higher spiritual idea and he defines it to mature and find God and yourself okay so it's as I go through the minutiae of every day that's going to it's it's most likely that that we lose touch with that wee wee pads to the background he's encouraging wake up young German wake up in you and if if that's going to wake up
it has to go to sleep to others are wearing as has to kind of turned his back to other things you know and that's like all its change of perspective that every little annoyance in life that we feel is so significant in that we
 give so much mental energy to
 is actually very insignificant if this higher calling becomes a significant thing when we focus on that hire call him when we threw our practices in with her dearly hearing about what I'm through a meditation practice has three who we associate with and excetera excetera
 when we bring our Focus to that hire call then naturally
 we let go of all the petty annoyances that you did the mental energy that we that we focus on them in the end so that by the time is encouraging us to do that
 like that thank you
 you're right
the documentary on television I don't even knows who she is or anything but she did I miss out on popular culture I just not interested in it
 are you sure that's how quickly we squirrel well okay
 Mary how much TV
 I know you watch real so you know what happens when I stay up late that's when I go down hill serious it's the same thing with their used to be like we used to read dramas those are the Emojis for the motives classic Shakespeare
I want to real
 are you getting pulled over by cops that's one of the classic ones I watch teenager Askew mouthing off the cops
 like really like that. Just do that right like I'm just going to keep mouthing off the cops in like put posting it yeah and I love to see the cops actually take them out that's what I love to do what about when those guys going to the ghetto neighborhoods and they just are threatening people write on the most awesome games of Conquest Conquest what should our respective agencies the Supreme Lord Huron Ryan
today the author messed up radiation bother a shooting at gym bag of us a buyer. Give it to you at the Marshall okay back to you about everything I sticky my regular tennis class in the bag Without End by rendering service to the devotees all this trouble to the heart become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the Trenton at the songs we established as in a revocable fat Tiana Timarron this year I was born in the darkness of ignorance is a Lotus feet 7 chapter 9 text 10 p.m. to get pulled over by a cop hands on the steering wheel what would you like officer registration licensure I hear it's going to end real quick
 okay
 you're ready I'm ready I'm ready
so next time slot is some he's he's his messages developing in his prayer
 he's he's he's praying out of humility
 and he sang put an important part of where is that right now I think it in the last text he was saying that someone may possess all of these qualities are generally admired in people right wealth aristocratic family Beauty austerity education expertise luster
 influence physical strength diligence intelligence mystical power layups shooting from the top of the key shootout shots it's a kind of boring at slam dunks right but but he says none of those satisfy you dear Lord that's not what's touches your heart that's not what
it's only devotion and I was only devotion now he's going to kind of continued that message and text him
 if a barometer has all 12 of the permanent go qualifications as their stated in the book called The synoptic Jetta what is under the Bodhi and is averse to the Lord is with the Lord so interesting that you can be a brahmana but be adverse to the Lord he is lower than a devotee who is a dog beater she could be this is very interesting and I hear a dog eater mean you could break some serious principles and still be a devoted be still have love in your heart for God right but who has dedicated everything is mine words activities wealth in life
 except for his desire to eat dogs Supreme Lord it may be is better than but it may mean that he's not actually eating the dogs but he's born in the dog eat her family and maybe with the Maybe
indicated they're okay such a devotee is interesting that they even mentioned dog eater first of all it's horrible in our culture before we love dogs but make a good name for a band with the l e protests at their concerts in such a Brahma. Because the devotee can purify his whole family whereas the so-called brahmana in a position of false Prestige cannot purify even himself text 11. You don't want to send this dog eater
 this verse is quoted by Prophet often
right many times he goes to this verse you know that I believe this verse may also be quoted by Rupa go swimming about the rest of me to send if I remember correctly I'm not sure about that
 but this is a highlight of of the bog with time this is this is where the Bob & Tom is trying to say hey everybody you're all caught up in your religious interpretations about life a lot of people that are in The Vedic Realm
 to get caught up in the grammatical qualities that are higher and higher keys and also the different facets of the culture in the practice that are means to an end you get caught up in the means and you forget the end you forget the real purpose right so prahlada set you know people born there is
 a value and some meaning to being born in a family of deep Libra medical peep
it's very likely that you're going to imbibe good qualities from the healthful qualities qualities that will be helpful for you receiving truth understanding spirituality and so on but just because you're born in that family
 doesn't mean that you actually do and buy those qualities and really live them what to speak of really connect with God sopra lots and Baba Thomas hanging and just being said in a very explicit way in this verse even if you're born in a very what what would be from The Vedic perspective very low family that that has all kind of harmful habits
 habitat will are more likely to Cloud your Clarity then then you know a create your Clarity princess dog eating ballasted this beautiful creature I kill a Slaughter.
that's what I have food with there's all this wonderful here's the broccoli healthy nutritious delicious Suffolk satisfying foods and I think I'm going to kill that dog you know take its bloody flesh you know throw it on a fire need that it means you know from The Vedic perspective it's saying you your your your perception is been distorted and cloudy but even if you're born in that family if you do Embrace these higher ideas of what to speak of particularly if you take it to that end the goal of it all that you developed genuine devotion forgot
 then that's that's the point about what I'm saying don't miss the point make the main keep the main thing the main thing never forget it and it's 6 and it's being expressed to the Palazzo
you know I'm I'm I'm kind of from a low Family Guy born in a family demons you know but you recognize my love for you you know you overlook all of my external shortcomings and there's you're only interested in this essential feature this Divine love
 I'm with you are you God had his always fully satisfied in himself there for when something is offered to him the offering by the Lord's Mercy is for the benefit of the devotee for the Lord does not need service for anyone who talked about this yesterday yeah we were saying how it's like it's not like the Lord needs your flowers created the flowers yes
the flower think you're doing him a good example of the mother saying okay remember it's Christmas maybe you should get me something for Christmas let's go pick out something for me for Christmas and the kid doesn't even pay for it at the mother wants to see that gesture of giving love to the mother provides the the money with which the kid buys the present to get to the mother
 it's actually not that it did the kid can say look at what I bought you Makin it alright great is the mother doesn't appreciate the actual gift itself she she could have went and bought herself a good parent like the Supreme Lord and it's set up and threw that the material energy is constantly trying us to be created us to be selfless beings instead of selfish beings right that the material energy is designed for us to become selfless servants that that that that come to this realization that we don't possess anything of this war
and if you don't fight that you're actually surfing a big wave it becomes ecstatic it becomes your ear in the barrel ear at your like completely like locked into this flow if you're trying to fight this this is the one you have a plan and the material nature is working against that plan you feel frustrated bitter and angry limited, what you're telling me we're going to do this is so important what you're sharing
 it's so important I am but you know it all ties together like the language used in this verse is it describes a large praying to Vishnu in the form of
 durisima he says ninja lava pornos humans innately
 and love hug means like satisfied like enjoying or satisfied
 by now
sure you're satisfied
 you don't need anything to complete you just like the mother doesn't need that gift from the child she's already got all the money to buy that right now she's she's completely didn't complete her by giving that little gift so he sang vision of your your innate we satisfy your need Lee enjoying life I don't need anyone in and then he says Mitchell of new djellaba pornos completely lacking in no way right set so so when were offering something
 it's not that he needed what we're offering you can be to be complete it said we benefit by making the offering he says by the Lord's Mercy it is for the benefit of the devotee for the Lord does not need service from anyone
 and then he gives his fascinating example ride really nice analogy to give an example if one space is decorated the reflection of one's face in the mirror is also seem to be decorated right it's like
know if I if if I put on if I look in the mirror and I put on earrings than the reflection has hearing the reflection has a reflection is Baron of these would look at that the person got the wind up reflected person has nothing no no no right so if you make an offering to God is not like you lost anything you asked you are benefiting from making that off for sure is if you try to put earrings on the reflection or lipstick already put on the real world were ridiculous you know it will let you know the 80s movement your potential and so much more we can do and the back of time is not like that it's sort of like yeah there's potential but the potential to should bring it to God Consciousness if your excelling
 at something but
taking away from God Consciousness then you're almost over endeavoring for something that's not give up you've missed them are completely your speeding really fast and driving really expertly on the road but you've missed your exit big deal and you were just sharing this I thought you were just sharing something something else you're saying that if you learn to go with its flow and I guess we would characterize that flows like Yeah by Nature I'm in this in this relationship right where I give where I serve and through that serving I'm nourished if we learn to go with that flow we become satisfied and if we resist that flow you said something like you were saying we become frustrated and resentful and angry
scared we have Disturbed my walk around with a disturbed mind I saw this interview just yesterday
 and it was exactly what he was watching again what website are you watching yesterday it was a conversation between this Christian Scientist I want to say he's a he's a Christian I don't even know if he's everywhere was a scientist as well as a Christian his name is John Lennox he's kind of he does a lot of debating you're familiar with him Irish gentleman scholar and I think Oxford Professor whatever no matter how do Monica think he had glasses like both lenses and he was speaking with a man and I think his name is Peter Atkins
you know, one of these full-on heavy-duty atheists yeah so it was I saw it was something like a five-minute clip of a longer conversation that there haven't but sounds like a real
 so I can get started with with Peter Adkins speaking and everything that was being expressed through his words and even his like his body language was that a frustration
 and he was saying if only we could turn back the clock
 is in the problem is is that science grew out of religion
 right right first and it from a western perspective you could it's true I said that first there's this year did there these religious thinkers and out of the church you know group greatest scientist in all those early scientists
Believers in God sure I have all these Newton and selling his own with any saying and so it's kind of like he was more that's what he was saying the religionists they got in first and now the scientists have to fight against that momentum
 and he said if only it were the other way around you know if only signs was established first then the religious people have such a hard time you do battle against the science he wouldn't stand a chance you know and then and he went on for that Ford for some time and it was almost I almost felt sorry for him
 because I could just see how frustrating disturbs you was you know it was it was it was like it was almost to the point where he's Beyond arguing and we he was just lamenting you know it wasn't meant to say frustrated but there's so many examples and he started listing CS
this one and that one it is an important sign contemporary scientist who were who began is atheist
 coming from that platform already and who found God through science and he thinks I really don't think that your argument holds any can really holds any water
 and then and then Peter actions that you know when you get frustrated then you just start to resort to just kind of like them not solid argument but just kind of mischaracterizing your opponent
 you know I forget what he said what did he say
 he said something like a he he just kind of characterized theology has I think he called it like a
 I forget what tourney use but it was really like a denigrating terms like he called it something like that it's like some kind of senility his kind of keeping he wasn't on that level he was Secure
and it is in his face and he said well you know for you going to come to that level where you just you know I could I could just characterize your belief in science in the same way if you want to we're not getting anywhere for and then in something in which he saw something in his and what he said
 made Peter I can say what what are you talkin about like what what cuz he was characterizing religion is like giving you comfort
 from the realities of from the harsh realities of existence right that's why people go to it and and John Lennox were saying I could just as easily characterize your thing that way and flip it back on you but what's funny is what does what does a season give you comfort from
 Aces from having to meet Todd from having to see that something like that right
 and and I think that that's pieces in other words there is that there is that resistance
your head must be like the ultimate failure like you've given up you you stop coping with reality you accept some magical being that there's and what Jon Lester saying that there's a resistance in you a psychological disposition that wants to resist the idea that there's someone behind me there's someone I'm depending on there someone that can establish morality
 right that I need to submit to if I'm going to be satisfied and and and good that's what you're resisting you know you don't have to let you know you don't have to do it so any case that you did just when you said that that the first Ridge and it kind of puts a lot of saying the same thing that's worse right don't think that you're going to lose your talk about that shudder to think you don't think that you're going to lose out I should have to look that up and say a word Prophet says here is
a foolish person is a maze that Krishna orders sarva Diamond procedure mum a Concerto Number 2 by abandon all varieties of religious activities in surrender just Auntie Mame Camille only it sounds so demanding right who is he to make such a such a selfish demands
 give up all the Dharma he's saying give a ball performing your Dharma
 so so he said some fully Scholars even say that this is too much to demand that I could see Peter Atkins to much but but this demand is not for the benefit of the Supreme personality guarded rather it is for the benefit of human society
 it's like a parent saying hey I'm here for you just take shelter with me you know is it is that a is that a sick Demand on the on the on the part of the parent or is it a loving representation of reality
like you need me to help you and I'm in a lot of my love for you I want to help you he says but this demand is not for the benefit of the Supreme personality got it rather it is for the benefit of human society if human beings individually and collectively surrender everything to the Supreme personality guided in full Krishna consciousness
 all of human society will benefit of having having a traffic laws the traffic rules are there not because to control us or did you take something from us but to add some efficiency to our life to add some flow to our life to add some
 I want to create my own there is no laws there's just whatever we feel and today I feel like zigzagging laws are for our benefit it's not it's not that God's trying to put the thumb on top of us and grind us into the pavement
I want to find that shudder to think I've ever done it before the show I wish I would have thought about it
 say I thought something I don't know if this is the same one
 edit find
 shutter shut up
 can't seem to find it how can you keep reading we're going to tell me to find the shudder to think of you
 a shudder to think we have got up this isn't it but let me try to find the supreme law of the screen person I've got head is always fully satisfied in himself therefore it's something is offered to him the offering by the Lord's offering something is offered to him the offering by the Lord's Mercy is for the benefit of a devotee of the Lord does not need serve
for anyone to get example if one space is decorated the reflection of one's face in a mirror is also to be decorated you do realize that's the virtue just rather a double in it there for although I was born in a family
 I met without a doubt offer prayers to the Lord
 with Poland ever as far as my intelligence allows read that again therefore although I was born in the demoniac family I met without a doubt offer prayers to the Lord with full Endeavor as far as my intelligence allows anyone who has been forced by ignorance to enter the material world may be purified of material life if he offers prayers to the Lord and here's the Lord's glory is true it's true
 back to you they'll keep you please and I'm going to find the shattered oh my Lord
the demigods headed by Laura brehm on our sincere Servants of your lordship who are situated in transit at the position therefore they are not like us a lot in his father the demon run in Cashew Pooh your appearance in this fearsome form is your past time for your own pleasure section Incarnation is always been for the protection and Improvement of the universe you had Lord Vishnu to the life everything becomes auspicious it just does your in a car ride back from New York City you had a little bit Lord Vishnu me I took called Henry on the phone you have just talked about Lord Vishnu and then we deviate a little talk about some other things and station to the to the retreat to the holiday to the dinner table when you add Lord to your down time when you add something Transit until it changes the energy of every
if you're feeling a little down a little depressed a little low as some transcendental sounds
 and he might not feel good that nonsense things feel a little good but you end up with this heavy head
 okay
 next
 my dear Lord dear Lord to string a day please therefore cease your anger now that my father the great demon run in cuz she who has been killed cuz the easy since even saintly persons take pleasure in the killing of a scorpion or a snake
 all the worlds have achieved great satisfaction because of the death of this demon
 snake lovers out there don't get upset by this verse now they are confident of their happiness and they will always remember
vicious incarnation in order to be free from Fear
 do you get Bad Karma to kill a poisonous snake
 it seems that if it's you know who is threatening so it's kind of like a self-defense and yeah like in the Mahabharata says one attacks with a deadly weapon you can tell they're not going to be Karma
 so maybe that's the bite of a Venom of a snake
 it's probably some karma in it but
 but Lord you are never conquered by anyone I am I am certainly not afraid of your ferocious mouth and your tongue your eyes Bright Like the Sun or you're frowning eyebrows I do not fear your sharp pinching teeth your Garland of intestines is pretty scary your main soaked with blood or your high wedge like years nor do I feel fear your
Moltres roaring which makes elephants lead to distant places or your nails which are meant to kill your enemies
 all most powerful instrument on to the Lord who are kind to the Fallen Souls I have been put into the association of demons as result of my activities and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of life within this material world
 when will that moment come when you will call me to the shelter of your Lotus feet which are the ultimate goal for Liberation from condition life interesting so he's saying he's looking at a vision that's terrifying so lion
 got a Garland of intestines covered in blood they say his tongue was like terrifying you know that had this like move it around here sometimes
 snakes or whatever in a scary Forest kind of telling you no
leaving now for tongue are you sure he's a lion might have been for, positive
