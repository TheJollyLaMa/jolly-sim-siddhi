 and thank you for pointing that out but I'm looking forward to that stupid day off tomorrow at a off all right I didn't know those existed this is so you can pull pull your life together and okay we had a great time at the at the Barclays Center was in the sages Community picnic I really didn't want to like that cuz you know that I liked it
we had people come out it was really nice it was very good and I said we're going to do it again on August 26th that's a No-No
 every August 25th I think that it's a tender ya on the Sunday August 25th
 and I August 26th is janmashtami Christians birthday so like you know this is a chance to kind of make a thing out of it if you want you know take Monday off come on out here come out for Sunday
 and then I'll Monday at the Barclay Center to way to go Monday at the box maybe you should maybe you two should think about doing Jamar Smith epoxy Center
 yeah we usually do something out here we make different altars around the property and we sang alter to alter which is pretty fun to her head on straight figured out. Let's figure that out also I Thomas I said one of our regulars Uber is from the old school days he made a great documentary about
people traveling on their spiritual journey called something Divine with Livalo real good. I made it to the movie poster he's doing a Premiere showing in Massachusetts at in Arlington Mass I'm going to encourage everybody from Rhode Island Boston Maine New England come down and western Mass people to come it's in its on the 21st of of August which is midweek on on Wednesday and yeah it's at a place called The Regent Theater and its at 5 p.m. so we're all going to show up our whole Posse it was with sages Posse and support, it's great movie I saw it already let us watch we were here that day we let us watch it I saw it as well
 we're going to go out it's a lot of pilgrimage
cuz he's going to put her pilgrimage with you many times a lot of pilgrimage footage lot of Life shelter in the ditch it was very cool testimonies as to what people were experiencing and Russia keishin brindavan how how how the trip was affecting them a lot of that kind of stuff but but but I think he wanted to do it on me but all these other characters came in the picture and what they're going through in their life and they're facing off with and have have spiritualities when shifting a life around it came together very interesting very interesting to see like the fact that pilgrimage can have on someone's life food different people going through different things in life than they're going on the same pilgrimage and how they're processing it too or we're sure to
 so let's all get together we'll get together then Tom you know we'll have a good time then
do I run to get into the the questions and answers
 alright so let's go to the questions you're the first questions that he's regular Zoomer from England and we're going to read it so we have to meet him and have him read it is this the same are we still under a tutor and then you know what you're right this is if we are to take my pill like I don't have any questions I understand everything
 okay this is at shoot an under the Blissful a cute
 I have a question about the word faith because it's used in different ways sometimes religious people use the world word faith to me and a belief or a hope they tell us to have faith in the existence of God it has an undertone of not knowing for sure but believing anyway as if in
opposition to rationality just believe that you're taken care of when you died yeah
 but faith can also be one of knowing we might have faith in a particular quality of a person we know or in our own skill right by faith that I'm a good skateboard and I can make it down this hill example
 the death of this definition is more akin to confidence so what did Krishna devotees mean when they speak of having faith in Krishna very good question and I think you know what I think because of the English language the Sanskrit language gives a lot more detail into that word I think that's where you're going to come from that alone and you're going to get different levels of Faith or have that word can be bro
the part to mean both of those things with the word shot her or the word fish fossil it would I don't know I don't know what you're going to do that up to you but I will say that you hear this a lot I heard it's like growing up in Christianity I just faith in Jesus have faith in heaven have faith in these things that seem so like
 a big leap it's a very big leap I never heard anybody tell me about Krishna Consciousness like that just believe in the demigods just believe Ganesh wrote it down I've heard them say things like well
 could there be a elephant-headed God name Ganesh
 I guess you could be I guess I could be he might not be there but he could be there first of all we blow the ceiling from the very beginning of our reality by saying we don't know everything and that's a big one I think for people is we don't know everything we have a
limited understanding of reality it's as if we live under a table and we're trying to speculate about the national parks of America we live on your table in Upstate New York what do I do about Yosemite I live under damn table right so that you have a come out from underneath the table this is what we do in this tiny little you and not only that but our senses are limited we think we have complete absolute Vision we create Sciences around our puny Vision but our sensors are limited and therefore we cannot perfect knowledge so in the van if they speak of fantastic things of Davies and Davies our gods and goddesses we don't know that really except they could be real so if you could approach basic teachings as they could be
 but what do you know I take I take Krishna Consciousness in these small bite-sized pieces what do you know and
I got a whole list together things I know and I move a little step closer to God so it's something it's realize pratyaksh I can my mom dumb young Susu come cartoon that's in the 9 chapter Christian says is the king of knowledge the king king of Education
 a kid because it gives direct perception of the Soul by realization it's the Perfection of Dharma it is Everlasting and its joyfully for performed
 so on this path we're experiencing the joy of doing all the little things that we get instructed inside the body more like wow that feels good that makes me this changes my mind to change my body these changes my heart is changed the way I treat people is with change the way I treat myself oh I got to regulate my senses I didn't know that I was just going all out there or I should rise early or I should regulate
I thought I should notice my thoughts I should see everybody as a spiritual being and not based on their color or their religion or their political affiliations I should live in a world where we don't have enemies and see them on a more subtle level and so when we can move forward we should chat the Hari Krishna maha-mantra we should make it a regular practice and see if it affects chanted for a week and has affected me okay so we're taking tiny little steps forward and when I when I say the English word have have faith it really just means
 try to step out and if it sounds good take a little step forward and that usually involves having a person that I trust like I trust the stupid draw do you know you should just try this
 maybe don't eat garlic bread
a lot of garlic. See over here I know you're not after your confession the other day on the podcast but anyway so I said okay I respect him so when you respect a devotee and you hear from them and they give you some instructions on a daily sadhna or daily regulated activities
 that's called sudden the Baki we're doing on faith of a teacher and we're putting it into her life in a practice and we're feeling some type of direct perception and I want to move forward and one of the most common questions we going to podcast is what else can I do how can I make this go deeper how can I add more to this and that's where we are. That's why we're doing Sage Academy that's why we're doing online trainings that's what we're working for four people can go deeper into all of the stuff that's why we do physical Retreat for people come to the farm
we go to Italy or we have a picnic in New York City work in the association with devoting some walk away from it and feel like okay that was something I experienced something that's why we go on pilgrimage where it's your life changes the whole trajekt I'm serious people have life-changing experiences on pilgrimage and it makes no material since it's just a place it's not like even the nicest place we've ever been to in your life I mean I've been to bring beautiful places in my travels with my punk rock band right but it's not like we're going to like some place in Switzerland somewhere going to messy India got freedom organized litter on the ground but people are having life-changing experiences why is that and this is how we move forward in Baki these little doses of realization encouraging us to take small steps forward think about progress don't worry about perfect
that's coming at least have faith that it's coming so that explanation and I want to hear your part. You said lame. Lame explanation but sophisticated and I'm not surface, just an ordinary guy to run that but lets you know that's just open up a dictionary like Ordinary People to see what it means but I think one way that we can look at the history of the world you know it's kind of a world of competing ideologies and people have different ideas about what life is all about and how it should be spent in what we should do and how we should
 I was just been around time how we should organize Society you know we have these competing ideologies about it end part of that competition
 is the
population of language you know how words become Define redefined what they represent what ideas they represent in this kind of like a word that that that enters into those you know competitions of ideologies I think we if we if we open up the dictionary look at Faith I got it right here I think this is Merriam-Webster face a noun complete trust or confidence in someone or something that's called face right you have to trust your confidence and something and I think we've been kind of bad a false dichotomy
 that face is the opposite of reason or faith is the opposite of science right there's people that are in two reason two people that are designs their rational clear thinking people that aren't buying into ridiculous myths in
hopelessly confused or emotionally weak and therefore reaching for some kind of cruch you know or something like that and then you know then there's those people that have to face their like another category person that's the you know that he had their the irrational silly kind of people that have no face simply means once conviction wants trust or competence and something or something someone or something so the way that works is reason leads to Faith science leads to face like I don't know that he wasn't yours it was the definition of reason
 the power of the mind to think understand informed judgments by process of logic
 so the power of your mind to think and understand and form judgments by process of logic should lead
 to your trust or confidence in something or someone your face
recent Lisa Faith or here's the definition of science
 the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation experimentation and the testing of theories against the evidence of taint that Science Guy so your systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical natural world through observation experimentation excetera will lead to your convictions or to your face to your trust or confidence in any particular thing or idea
 so recently Stu Faith signs Lisa Faith philosophy should lead to face religion should lead to Faith yoga should lead to Faith it we're all developing our convictions two different types of reason your experimentation
 it's not that the two are opposite and and you know there's some very reasonable
Ramon has a reasonably I use that term intentionally another through reasoning we can come to our faith life and we say think we share things like this on the show sometimes
 let's say that you go to sleep and it's snowing and you wake up in the morning and right there in front of your house is a snow sculpture that is like a perfect replica of Michelangelo's David fake ass like whoa you know like that's amazing now due to my my mind's power to think and understand informed judgments based on a process of logic
 I can conclude I will likely conclude that a human being created that
 snow statue rather
and it would rather than the idea that it just felt like that sure that that would beat you know through my systematic study of the structure and behavior the physical natural world through observation
 which is called science
 I would logically infer or conclude or develop the face that a human being or human beings or some kind of alien or something kind of living creature with intelligence and will and so on created that structure but I can't prove it somehow could say well you can't prove that and I feel like they can say is just your face my face but it's a faith-based on reasoning it's a face specialist. I call it reasonable Faith but I think even when you say it like that it almost sounds a week or you know like you know it's faith based on reason it's it's like you know it's face based on all
experience in this world I have that conviction and if you're going to tell me that it just happened on its own I'm going to say no that's unreasonable I've experienced too much in this world to believe that that's remotely possible that's and it's kind of like saying like we would say Sciences we can experiment with boiling water
 and we see that you know at 211 degrees Fahrenheit is not blowing it but once it gets up to 2:12 it boils
 that at 2:12 yeah there's actually a number 11 off the Science Guy bought needs his thing so you know some of them say that we've included through scientific experiment that water boils at
12 degrees in summer to come outside well that's just your face
 well now we experimented with him every time I do okay but every time you don't know if the next time you don't know your face you know that you're right that's that's that's very rational that's irrational like more rational but whenever we tried so so you know so I believe that the influential people are kind of like taking a crowbar and trying to like
 how to take any
 you know this idea
 there's a big bang and then there was a pollution and that's how things got here
 I don't know if that's not face like
fantastic creation story than that yeah so we shouldn't be bullied or intimidated by this kind of when we should be fooled by different types of
 I don't know I guess you could call it like intellectual bullying you know know the fact is is that everybody in the world is developing their convictions based on how well they can apply their reason based on how well they can apply their science but but it's not that there's face on one side and reason the other side of our faith on one side and sign so that's not how it works and you know the importance of faith in the practicing a bhakti you know the importance of the confidence in someone or something becomes very important because you're following a pat it is just like
 like if like let's say someone was visiting New York City
and they needed to get somewhere and you know I'm from here you know I can help you get there I can give you good directions how to get there and I could say you know you eat you walk down to the street then you take a left you know then you walk this many blocks and then you take a right and then you know when you get here actually know the kind of dead ends but you got to go around this way and you and I could give you directions and someone might be following this rashes but have doubt in my ability to give the directions or maybe at first they they had faith in my directions but as they started going it wasn't playing out like they had anticipated
 and they're losing face that my directions are accurate ones and someone might say no no and then some of my signal just have faith you know like he knows what he's doing he knows this area knows it much better than we do
have faith that what he's saying is correct even though it may not seem to be correct right now or even though it may be even though you're it may be challenging to your presumptions have faith and that's what faith means that the practice about to be there so I told her having faith in one's Guru having faith in these sacred texts having you don't have any faith in them because they're meant to direct you to come to a place you noted that you have to do you have to make that journey to get them and as you go on that Journey if you don't keep the face
 then you can get diverted
 you know so it's just I can have the letter I want to study to be a little like a violinist or some like that in and it's shrimp when I'm losing faith in my teacher that they can actually help me do this or you do with them you know that's how we apply reason we go and we say well they've had many good students if this teacher and look at all the students have had in the past I have faith in them
so that even when what they're saying to me is challenging I say what I have faith right cuz based on my reason I see that many good students have many of their students have become experts and it's not unreasonable snot some ridiculous religious mythological know it's just clear rational thinking you know if I'm looking at a person as a group that I said that one has very consistent clear answers to my questions and that I see that they have achieved a state of awareness that I admire and that I want you know if you use your your rational thought to establish your conviction to stablish your confidence to stablish that I'm on the right path here essentially that's what we're talking about we're talking to the conviction that I'm on the right path you know that's that's face in body so it's not different than what we do if we just open up the dictionary complete trust your confidence and something or someone
and it's no different than them in any other kind of filled in that sense you know
 that that we we apply a reason
 we put it to the test or experiment with it we see if it holds up and and then and then that and then once you develop that conviction strong conviction and you know this. There is a famous person and the chief Tony Chargin Rica shut a sub shove Davis fasika his surgery done this child Krishna bhakti Kylie's however, cut the Hoya shut off Shut De the word shut her
 this is basically a Sudanese child that it refers to this firm conviction that Krishna puppy Kylie that simply by performing devotional service to Krishna simply by by Bucky to Krishna sarva, Critter higher than all my responsibilities were Phil nothing is lacking I don't need anything else I haven't that that's
enough in life right that's the end of that and that it's complete and thorough you know that it that it's not missing anything the strata is the shutter means The Confident firm faith that by rendering chance in a lovely service to Krishna
 One automatically is performed all their subsidiary activities is all covered in that so like one has to have that kind of faith if they're going to reach the end of it is a challenging thing and so that's how Faith plays out in the practice of
 alright I get like it good job thank you Robin
 all right let's go to the next question but you did good it was thank you for not breaking into George Michael
 is it a few songs we have that are always on rotation on this podcast by Danny kozikowski is a regular
Zoomer regular other Irregulars other
 if you're new to the shell and others Zoom every morning so most people are out there listening to a podcast on YouTube on Spotify on Apple podcast we never see them occasionally so I'm looking up to us on the subway on the street and say oh my God was with sages I love you guys or was with sages what's up or something like that and they were like I listen but we've never seen them and Zuma quite shocking but they're out there to called their friend so she's both she's on the show live sometimes he's out there as of other sometimes she comes up to the farm she's wonderful
 oh we're going to hit looks like a choo to Institute under the Yeah Yeah Yeahs interesting okay.
 Your produce I miss you I've been in other since going back to work and praying for some
person Association suit against work here with some of the sages know our butts off but thank you all for your continued Endeavors an amazing service and all the love I said you still out there listening isn't other any after not being not being in a workplace for about 4 years I feel like a complete alien when interacting with most of my co-workers I know you have spoke on the topic before but I could use some reminders I work in a big beautiful library and traditionally Librarians have been open-minded but lately I feel like I'm in Bizarro world if the general conversation in the offices is mundane and insane my team my teams have zero respect for librarians or teachers they talk over me curse throw things out of control and many of the staff and many of the staff
are outwardly political
 oh oh when she says my teen she's not talking about her personal teens you know what is he doing why is cool like that
 too much information about your kids throwing stuff but I get it yeah yes also are building and grounds used to be a Convent interested I was asked to produce a giant display as an homage to the specific order of the nuns that used to live here it's not nice and includes several bibliographies after 4 months of work I had painted the display search doubt vintage titles made a timeline excetera I also at 6 bibliographies
 a collection of books that are used as reference form from keywords of the mission and vision of a nun's. Trusting I would have loved to see that display obviously the books in the
Agra fees included titles on God
 for kids teens and adults in general pictures in the books General self-help for teens and more specific for adults of being on display all of them were taken down because a few patrons complained about separation of church and state
 patrons not Patriots pets have it for my community God Holiness that the books were random they works hard and you're studying history finish the question before you started a I need tips for how to be remain Krishna conscious
an environment that believes God keeps getting sensitive I was really I was really angry I mean we have books on all subjects yet I cannot use the word of God rant over I need tips for how to remain Krishna conscious in an environment that believes God is the enemy kaszuba Rockland Mara thank you for your example inspiration support I'm furious right now I just wasting my time with you I'm furious I'm ready to slip Tate like one of those tables you like one of those parents had like that it's like the school board meeting because I chastise in the whole school board that have to get taken out by a cop. Have you ever had first of all you're doing a history class
 now she's not doing a history timeline and in respect to what is your store that's that's history it says history and guess what God and religious movements are part of this mystery specially when you built it on a in a convent
you probably had to like you know
 what do you call evacuate some nuns when you started that library but I had to kick a few out
 how to remain Krishna conscious it's hard it's hard it's hard for me and it's such a and the world has gotten so incredibly hateful its I can't I tell you you can't even look at the news he just gets so angry and the algorithm the algorithms that just pushed farther and farther apart algorithms algorithms are the enemy but if you can keep the main thing the main thing
 see everybody is part of God and lean into that cuz to admit we've had this conversation because we see the world go off track on so many ways and it's not like we don't have opinions on it
 but we don't push their on the summer
details I'm not pushing about animal rights even though I own the rights of very important I'm not pushing on vegetarianism begin is among all those are things are very important why because if a person really is against veganism
 yeah that doesn't that doesn't exclude them from the higher thing get people into the highest thing
 and then all the other good things will follow don't push the details push the real principles and a main principle is that we are tiny parts of the Supreme Christian is Accenture Krishna that is is a name for God and he's the source of all avatars and God sends different missionaries in this world you don't have to go into the political hot in the minefields with people and also you convince more you attract more
honey then you attract with
 vinegar thank you man when people see that you're actually connected in your Krishna Consciousness it's very attractive if you're going around bible-thumping or bug of agita thumping for people to change shaming people to change getting a nasty debates with people they might you might win the debate but you don't win their heart over so you have to create a protective shell around you for like a snow globe to have a little snow globe through your journey through right through your side and a sweet kind of like water before scuba diving they have these giant metal helmets he's like LED shoes and he was like
to be like that walking into these places like you're in it but you're not of the insanity don't go into this conversation keep the conversations high in appreciation and gratitude and Divinity keep a little altar on your desk my private little alter I don't people see how different you are they want to be like you. Going to ask you questions that's when you have when people start asking you questions hey man what are you into that's when you have leverage okay no thank you. I mean
 that's what you asked you what I've been in situations myself and then I remember liking martial arts Shirley but you know what I did try to preach to them I just did my thing and eventually
what people see they like you they respect you on their terms then you can speak to them when they when they start to inquire what it what are you into what do you like oh yeah you know but you got to be that example first
 that's what I find create that bubble with a strong sadhna and attraction to Krishna which comes from chanting and reading stories about Krishna
 and then you can go in anywhere you can go into the fire but you're well protected that I think that they appreciate what you've shared it and I think that this question it is a little bit related to the previous one
 it worded it again has to do with competing ideologies
 this
 you know you put up something that you're asked to do something you do it well
 and then summer comes
this is about God and there's supposed to be a separation between church and state answer take it down and because of the patrons then they have to Cave to that pressure
 now I don't know if this is a public school or private school because what I tell ya but let's assume that it's a public school because if it's not a public school than the question the separation of church and state doesn't even come into play yeah right so let's let's assume that it's a public school
 it is public it is public so
 here's the thing with the separation of church and state is there you know it was Thomas Jefferson that kind of like wrote on this you know originally and you know it was out of his writings that this song
 that is how you developed about the separation of church and state in the idea is that an oppressive
institution can't come along and Bully everyone pushing their ideology on everyone you know that's so so when it comes to the to the government debt to the governing of the state we shouldn't allow an institution like that to come in and and push themselves around weed there should be freedom
 to for everyone to express their ideas you no no no institution could come along and say you can't talk about those ideas you know that's that's the value of the separation between church and state the irony
 is that these patients are more or less doing that same thing here they're saying I have my ideology and I don't want any other thought that competes with my Audiology. I don't even want a whiff of that in here even if you're just telling history
 I don't want to hear it you know it and I and I definitely don't want any kids falling up
books that might help in any way the counter to my Audiology so you got to take this down it's you know there's there's a competition I mean there's always a competition but you know what you know where we could really start this cuz this gets to 22 Woodward and his question goes I've come to this and my 50 years of of wandering through this world Danny
 I've come to the conviction
 that this world is always a mess it's like particularly in this age and is its it never snapped into place like we hope it would snap into place in the messy people are the more arrogant they are it's like goes hand-in-hand with meta penises are the stronger your you're in the people that are most strongly vocalizing their opinion that are like the most thick-headed you know commonly so this but there's always comments do you know
competition tension between liberal and conservative
 you know the liberal idea is it has to do with compassion for those that are vulnerable and like an antipathy towards those that may impress that's like that's the liberal concern and then there's the concern of concern in the conserve the concern is like respect for tradition because it helps to maintain order and that's imported in society and what we do now this is we choose one or the other and we demonize the other let you know why there needs to be a balanced life is all about bouncing out these two concerns seeing how I guess that's what it's for if you get too liberal everything gets crazy and falls apart and if you get too concerned if it gets oppressive and so on in and in the bizarre thing is like it likes let's take the what I think what's going on here and Danny's I just a liberal ideas being put
to the extent that it becomes oppressive
 you know that next that's that's the irony in this is that now there's someone dictating what book did they're banning books like the Liberals are those supposed to be the ones that are against her in a box service or like we can have people reading all kind of things cuz it's going to disturb the order and the Liberals come see no you have to have freedom of thought don't don't oppress me with your you do you know with your power in your ideology Don't Force It upon me give everyone the freedom dead when should you know you should have the the freedom to pursue what ideas they want without this institution is religious institution whatever imposing on us but now the same thing has happened is coming back the other way people are thick nowadays they don't think very deeply that they think they grabbed an ideology but they don't really put a test it themselves or or they they they approached on such a shallow level and they don't see the internal contradictions that are taken
and we see going up to the highest levels right like like this whole thing kind of played out in a Harvard like that that's a very good at so long to University Heights university is in the bring up before like our Senate right like you know where are condors are you watching Senate hearings that was our Congress is supposed to be like we chose and all our Representatives like these people that are really got their act together and that could you know that that have the ability to to purely you know represent the interests of their people and then we have our highest universe is it like the deepest thinkers and it's in these people in their self incredibly clueless because they grabbed an Audiology rather than grabbing principles you know like meaningful principles they can't determine what is Free Speech what is hate speech what do you know that they have no idea they just expose themselves as like
 is Alma
their ability to make decisions it's come down to this like incredibly childish level like where they're they're almost clueless and they're trying to appease a fringe population as well like it could because their leaders so they're trying to appease keep their jobs Etc and in the end in India with her patrons basic principles simple these things are pretty simple and I think most of the demographic is somewhere in the middle there and there's just fringes under no doubt to bomb the middle path to walk this middle path
 I think the way that these kind of pressures have become so intense that I think it dumbs us all down it gets us to this point where we can't think very clearly you know we need like debate in Indiana we need that kind of stuff you don't like healthy
deities is there in the beta Society like the bait was like a big thing you know people to take it too far they could get too into it but but yeah you know which we should be able to intelligently discuss rationally discuss these ideas Danny you're in a place where you nose is high schools that maybe you're like are the most confused on his home school they are really meant to be the places where ideas are are are brought up in discussed and debated you know that's what schools are meant to do the method not meant to put an ideology they're meant to help you think
 you know there are there that they're meant to train you and the ability to think and not there you're not what to think how do yeah it's so let you know here to hear some shallow thinking Patron this like we can't have any talk about God in here that's it that's you know that's a contradiction.
symbol of separation of church and state know you're doing exactly what you don't want the church to do you're just competing you just want to win by being oppressive as you've seen a church be pressed by Banning books that disagree with you that's what churches do so they don't understand and they never will so how do you deal with that and you know you can I would keep a peaceful head right I know it's driving you crazy you know you might want it like word out something to say hey it seems to me like you going to do some misapplication hear about the concept of the separation of church and state the separation of church and state is meant to prevent a church from your evil forcing ideology on people
 and and I was just reporting history that people can take in and compared with other history and compared with other ideas this is supposed to place
all the ideas come up and people learn to think about them it and in choose their own way of living and you're forcing and ideology on people by Banning books what's happening here isn't this a contradiction you can express it maybe write it or something but don't expect that you're going to win
 you know you're an institution that's probably deeply lost in in its ideology Maybe not maybe you could win maybe maybe you know maybe come to the attention of the right person that's a unit that's right we need to carefully consider how we make these decisions so you could try that you know you could write a little a little response and share it with appropriate people
