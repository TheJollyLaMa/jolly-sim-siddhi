 I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes to the door side of knowledge
 I am from that be since he's at the Lotus feet read even the srimad bhagavatam canto
I'm sorry you had a 7 chapter 6 today and heavy heavy weight E versus I heard that should have brought Bud lectured from the teachings of prolonged Mars more than any other
 place in the Bible time
 Alpha doesn't mince words when he was sore like the fire under your butt and spiritual life like come on let's get serious and because of it
 look how much got done in those 11 years where he came to the West I mean we can't even it's hard to even fathom if you've traveled
world and seeing what he's created with the temples with the farm communities with the festival's with the Vedic cultural that's like seeped into the Western world and you know Russia it all manifested in in 11 years pretty much in their 11 years eve Globe you know and traveling wasn't that easy back then it was just a lil thick didn't have security at the airport so maybe it was easier it was really interesting is that Prophet also when you when you speak to a lot of his disciples is that in the lot of ways he somehow mystically gave people what they needed at a particular time and sometimes he was very strong and heavy and sometimes he was extraordinary Li he was always extraordinary caring and loving and sometimes light you know that Sean has been there for one of his disciple
who would tell the story about sharp how she the problem is always a little soft with him cuz he knew he couldn't take it he would say that you know and so it's it's yeah you find that like can be really sharp but then also build you back up in a loving way I am and what does the hard thing is that when we're reading Papa's books sometimes you get that sharp words in texts but he's not physically here to then extend that that build you back up loving Embrace that he would give to his disciples in person when he was there so there's like a is that that it's it's we're missing sometimes we miss that aspect sometimes that we could get a certain narrow Viewpoint of his thinking of this is what it is what he said here this book get ready for the tough stuff is coming up as a preparation trying to soften Landing I really resonate with what you were saying but I remember I was staying at Henry's house Henry on the show right now matter fact about 20 something
years ago maybe 25 years ago and I was reading Hari sorries multiple volume transitive glory of God and I was hoping to develop like an attraction an attachment to prop up a reading for if that's what we do we read the story of Krishna read the stories of the guru but I was getting sort of like it and it's embarrassing to say but I was like that's the way he's sounding is like a general and I don't feel embraced I feel intimidated and then I mentioned this to a mother yamuna good morning Debbie who's staying as a guest with Dina taraneh at Henry's Home in Washington DC while I was staying there and Ramona said something right beautiful she said you know
 that was a special time of Proverbs life where he was establishing a mission and private part was like a general
but we knew probably pod
 as almost like as a friend or as a father to us and that really helped me and I hate when I listen to the store demo kunda Maharaj was one of the original you know Michael Grant he was one of the original disciples also would come over the house as well because he was living in Washington DC and at that time he would share these personal stories you Moon it would share these personal stories and
 nausea medicine they are but Kim Kim Marie was there too and she was also had a lot of association with prabhupada Kim and Chris Murray so they would come or if he would share she would share these beautiful stories and I just saw this very affectionate side of prabhupada fatherly beside about which is exactly what I needed to hear in my own personal life but at the same time I can understand how her iPod has to set this
 very extreme such as Prophet also it's these versus the bottom is also
it's not talking about necessarily hey let's find a middle path in life it's saying listen this what's your world's a temporary place just get that under your get that in your head it's a temporary place you know there's just you and God understand that everything is support is meant to support this relationship between you and God so anyway before
 you know explain this whole thing out I was driving what what verse are we on
 X6
 Canto 7 6:6 okay with the 100 years give or take
 but for one who cannot control his senses half of those years are completely lost at night he sleeps 12 hours being cut
Tigres
 being covered by ignorance that's true there for such a person has half of that lifetime only 50 years
 put yourself in surgery cuz most people don't live to hundreds of similar to a T and yeah the point is we're going in a direction that that over the next couple versus is supposed to be like you only have a short time of Awakened conscious moments where you're not sleeping eating doing other stuff you know it's like there's a really really really short window here at and that sort of that that that that preps up were probably saying is that it's serious like it's actually very serious situation when you go to the doctor and he's just saying you know if you eat another this like you will die you know because you just been either you come to go jogging realized oh my God I was so close to just
you know but my pancreas is going to burst or something you know and so it's sort of that that mentality is you figure out this I'm a friend of mine at the situation where they was eating course for dinner
 hey you know it's also one of these things like a lot times are my choices what we want to do with our life aren't even our choices we're just sort of like heard it sometimes my parents are sometimes parents with good intentions or sometimes by culture or sometimes trying to impress an older sibling into a career path into an educational path or a job or sometimes by our own out-of-control senses and then we're going to get into this in the next few versus just sometimes by greed I know I can make a lot of money if I do this stuff like that which is true as well
so it's it's it's one of these things it's like
 you might sacrifice
 hearing the whisper of your heart hearing The Whisper Of God inside your heart
 for some
 contaminant of the mind last greed anger Envy or just trying to impress someone or go with someone's idea of what you think you need in your life so all this like self-reflection don't save it for old age this is stuff if you're young and you're hearing this stuff now is the time to really sort of Hell over the car and check the map where am I going with this life what am I doing with this like why am I working so hard to make this jerk rich off of times that's what we're doing with her like I'm working so hard to make some other guy Rich what where do I want to go why
running a race that has no destination
 there's no Finish Line that's what that's what your life until you got
 please continue
 text 7 in The Tender age of childhood when everyone is bewildered right 10 years pass right in your childhood run around play with dolls can ride in your by playing cops and robbers Cowboys and Indians whatever it is you're just like lost in the illusion
 right except for karuna who's 10 years old to listen to a podcast
 similarly in Boyhood engaged in sporting and playing okay there's a there's a next few years and it now you're getting it the sports is interesting I guess people are just Sports back then to engage in sporting and play one passes another 10 years in this way 20 years are wasted
is it wasted the bomb comes as wasted means in not deep contemplation of who I am and why am I here similarly in old age 11 is an invalid unable to perform even material activities one passes another 20 years wastefully
 not a lot left at some point not a lot left and then you got to work your butt off in those middle years what is his mind and senses are uncontrolled becomes increasingly attach the family life because of insatiable Lusty desires and very strong illusion is such a mad man's life this is always directed towards the men that I think I think because it was the man who are like studying these sacred literature so you'll get a lot of like man with
can take this just a serious of course cuz now it's not just like these Burr minikel man who are studying Sanskrit these are published in English that we all can read it such a mad man's life the remaining years are also wasted because even during those years he cannot engage himself in boxing ring devotional service in the old days like on this was talking about it's speaking of family life as like this big distraction and almost like diversion and almost a a simple activity were lucky if people get into family life nowadays in Kali Yuga people are so broken so dented if people can just settle down and have a family I remember as a Brahma Cherry because we're agreed that we would read these verses and when I was a monk I would read these verses one whose mind
chances are uncontrolled become the family life because of fires and strong illusion so it's almost like we are trained to hate sattva Guna was trained to despise it if you were probably more balanced I was an extremist my entire life now I'm trying to soften my edges but I remember like when you were brahmacharya sometimes householders would invite you to their home yeah and you would you would go in there as monks you do your little hairy Krishna program and then you leave and life comes was very highest Indians
 who have like a beautiful home the father was like a doctor the mother was like a wonderful housewife with a bunch of kids and and and they often times we had some type of material success now as a promise Charlie me being the fanatic that I was we'd go into those houses and
look around with disgust and I'd be like he's a big think they are with this two car garage looking at the house trying to blenders blenders smoothie for breakfast thank you
 are these pictures hanging you have nothing and no pictures on the wall you have no decorations you have excess for a look at these on the floor I think they are wasting their life and it's just such a is it it's there they're actually very sweet and beautiful and not even sucked but spiritual they've added Chris looks like they're having the monks come over to their house to preach to them
 anyway I I remember the right at Swami has many disciples to the thousands of siple
and followers and and the only time I've ever really heard him like genuinely sincerely from his heart just horrifying some of his disciples they were all householders yeah and I just said there's a couple of them especially those in chowpatty where he just was he what he what he said on multiple occasions he's reference certain people I won't mention their names but not to embarrass them but a multiple occasions have there more renounce and humble than any of the roaming charges are charged with making a right there a saying that to be nice if we were there in GTA V where to buy Cavani meeting right there was one devotee I was there a particular devotee is responsible for for funding the majority of the entire Geb project so many pulled me project to a certain point he made a determination
you would he was a barometer for 10 years made a determination he had nothing wasn't like I'm really rich and I'm going to give a portion mean he had nothing and he brought Mirage in front of the altar that I'm making a vow I want to go out and start a business and 50% of whatever I make I'm going to donate to you into the temple and and he struggled he started now he's super well that he continues to give said he's he's the most humble person has spent the whole we're supposed to talk about half-an-hour glorifying him
 you know what it's
 I get this I got this as a Brahma cherry and I'm not saying all brown a charger like this but I was just arrogant I think I was being like young Target but I knew everything. All the great houses were in Maya and then you realize like I'm detached I'm taller
I was intolerant you know what tolerance has taken care of a baby that's tolerance moms pushing a kid in a stroller mom a mother trying to get a kid in a stroller stroller that's tolerance every mom out there to get some there's a special trophy in heaven waiting for you mothers who tried to get their kid in a car seat that didn't want to get in that car seat and what does speak of having two kids getting two kids in a double stroller anyway there was there was there was a comedian who tells a joke about an airplane to hear a crying baby a I got such an inconvenience for you to hear a crying baby in the airplanes like there is a parent holding a crying baby
 you're you're a you're a good man is listening to somewhere there's a parent holding I'm alright baby crying baby
yeah it's true it's like I was that sort of like
 upset guy in the airplane like can they please shut that kid up how dare they and then once I had a kid I was like I don't want to hear anybody saying anything baby wants to yeah well there was also see the property either cuz you to profit came to America when he first came to New York but he wasn't the first of bhaktisiddhanta his Gru's disciple that came to the West package of the set some of the seniors disciples to London originally to try to just share boxy Bank of the West very interesting in like the 30s or the 40's what it were twenties whatever that was here tomorrow or someone on Moross and bond Mars was the one that Rhonda swim if you read journey home he was the one that brought us when he just went different job and ended up
yeah so they were there they could have did some some some stuff and they wasn't Ultra successful in the way that I think maybe he was hoping and developing is really on the level of profit by them probably came to America and you know many of his ass ipl's the disciple that he sent to London to start a temple there and they ultimately that the Beatles shamsundar molitty grew. Jamuna and you make a statement it was in my groom are sent to send you a cease and were able to do very little but my grass disciples have done so much more he was praising them and that way is really praising them so get a little get a lot of that also yeah I wrote when I was a barometer and I was criticizing my family I'll try to tell you how well that way I know if my stepdad just looked at me one point you just said I thought you were supposed to be happy
attracting all the all the spiritual life and here I am I just like Angry like or are you going to realize it and it's just like pent-up frustration that was a lot of arrogance in there a lot of arrogance yeah exactly okay back to our wasteful lives in a bog with him
 okay text e999 what person to attach the household life due to being unable to control his senses can liberate himself and attached householder is bound very strongly by the ropes of affection for his family while children husband and other relatives
 I didn't dare put this in in in perspective also of this concept of ownership yeah I own my family to there isn't there is a sense
I was saying earlier how we're lucky if people even get married a lot of people is just like uncontrolled Senses at least when there's a family unit together there's a concept of this is a container or my mind and my senses email now is driven by their lower lower passions and therefore having a family it contains those passions you know even if even if there if a man is dealing and struggling with the Lost often times that they will let you know I'm married I have children have to set an example and that contains their passions the love of their family
 we're lucky if people could even have a family now days what does marriage mean anyway I'm just going to date this is too this is it's just a piece of paper and we often times just thrown marriage out and we just
gate our whole adult life which doesn't help the senses get controlled and it doesn't regulate the mind which is the which is one of the purposes of the yoga system to regulate the money and therefore there can be it's hard to find peace there are you looking for looking for a relationship if you can't find a nice person
 give me the right person that too
 or bring their in here we think Baron hair softener edges marry a woman in the country
 I don't know if I have anything to add for this one to household life
I'm saying that this is a great thing so this concept of ownership like I own my children you know every I'm saying this in the interview yesterday every
 parents has to go through this for the most part we get under this illusion with a child that's going to talk about this the parent is so attached to the child who speaks in broken words is so adorable and the child looks like me we get so attached to that child and then nature if you don't create that I am like an independent Soul connected to God if you don't create that in your mind and in your heart
 material nature will start cutting and lopping and pruning I was outside gardening yesterday that's why I'm using these analogies lopping and pruning all your attachments away from you often times especially in America your kids who are very like
little child they want to be just like you would act like you my kid saw me on the tractor Dad when I get up I want to track your dad when I get older I want to chain saw you get your kid a little toy lawn mower so they can mimic you sometimes a little stove in a little cooking set because they want to mimic the parent then they get to the point where like I want nothing to do with my dad my dad they don't want to talk to you in the supermarket cuz they're embarrassed by their friends if someone sees me with you it's horrible they don't want to go on vacation with the parents anymore it's like breaks the parents heart like I thought I was the coolest in their eyes not most uncool
 I told her I was telling my kids I think I'm a cool dad don't you get it I was in a big man
 you are you are very cool. There was nothing you think I'm cool they weren't there was said when we were in Austria was like for the cool having a famous dad to get all kinds of free stuff
yeah give him time giving time
 Krishna I really appreciate the pain that you're making also because Robert emphasizes here multiple times to attach Overly Attached right and so it's it's it is that principle of the way that you were late to people thinking I'm in mind this is mine I control this end this it this is this is my identity this is who I am that I own these things in that as opposed to get a run us when he says it's often also in in in marriages if he's if he's there to marriage doesn't often but he'll say you know so-and-so is not your husband is a beloved child of Christian trust in your care and then it's on the other part of someone's not your wife their beloved child of Krishna entrusted into your care and if I'm thinking my wife my husband my kids as opposed to this is because
this is become the arena in which my ego is meant to be turned away from I am the center to I meant to serve the center then it becomes it becomes an actual I shall we say Greer has to Usher I'm so many ways Papa's not talking about the crew has to Usher I'm here he's talking about an unspiritual selfish centered approach towards relationships but the group has to offer from a place of shelter is where I can go and and you're saying I have sensors that just dragged all of the universe I'm agreeing to satisfy my senses in a regulated dignified way with integrity and I'm using it as a way for me to
 Chisel off the hard edges of my ego by recognizing I'm I'm here to serve that's that's a Maha Point Prabhu they're not mine they're in my care how do you
somebody who's in York are often times during yoga teacher training
 whenever I have a student
 I never say my I never think of them as all these are my students I think they're sent by my Guru for me to care for their sent by my Guru for me to care for because when you're getting a hold of my students she's my student he's my student Eagle behind that very often but I'm the master they're my student but I find it's like
 when you think someone is leaving somebody in your care that you take special care of that person like sometimes I could have my kids here and
 you know someone can say hey can you watch my son for a few hours I got to go to the store when you watching somebody else's kid parents know this there's so much extra care that goes into that kid my own kids can be like in a plane with chainsaws climbing down a well I'll be like that whatever
what do you need there's Extra Care looking out for someone else's kid so that is a great thing with your husband with your wife your children they are not yours there in care of you to love and to serve and not just to feed their bellies but to also give them spiritual life you have to give them spiritual life or they're not going to be good or not going to be healthy they're going to have that you're just developing them as sense gratify Earth we want to also feed our quote students are dependents we want to feed them we want to feed their bellies we want to love them up but we want we want to infuse their life with bhakti as well you want to understand like actually none of this is ours anyway
 yeah me and me and me and her parents whose Parenting teenagers right now also a devoted parent we are like encouraging you know our kids like come on kids your teenagers now time to get a job we eat over here.
get a job and show our kids are like really inspired in their job they're like they're like loving they're doing like door-to-door sales and they're all night making love at the teenagers love we can make a lot of money and everything now.
 Back and forth with these kids and how to pair them and you should learn how to communicate an hour and you got to go out and support yourself never like to support yourself too much
 hi Kurt Karina mention that when she's with her grandma are Grandmas so afraid would you plug the plug in the wall but her parents don't mind what you plug the plug yeah like you're going to let yourself be really careful with her parents so I got it for me yes like you're saying but also I really love what you're saying about going out that they're in
I care which I think there's an added extended mob point to that which is a yes or send it to my care but also they are the uniquely crafted ways in which Krishna is showing me how big my ego can be how selfish I can be like we all recognize I need to grow it back and not I'm not this perfected being it so I guess Trish is sending people to care for but it's like I need during my care and in the attempt to express that care
 I will grow in my body like I will learn all of the icky things in my heart and the ways that I think I meant to be served right and it kind of chisels and washes away all those things are Christians as a lot through that same process right you know it was
 I don't have any human child I'm a pop dad you don't have you don't have a human child
I'm just going to I'm just going to leave it at that. Do we have a dog
 what is the app has a joke cuz my wife and I choke that we have a son is he's a dog but what I'm saying is if we don't have kids but parent that you and you've mentioned he was also at one pair of Legends it's like you grow another heart that's just for them right it's a grow another heart that's just for that minute and it in it and it can soften you and take it whether there was that there was a story that one of our on us when we seen your disciples would come to the back you said when I was abroad much are living as a month there and then cuz you said you would sometimes get these heavy stories about you do Detachment in the house of Life etcetera but he told a different story said that there were there were two men
 who wanted to join an ashram
and both of their their wives had had died or passed away and so one of them came and said you don't want to join the ashram and they said what's your qualification is it won't my my wife passed away and it didn't bother me at all I was sober now it's been detached and that just shows how advanced that I am that I'm not attached to my my material life and etcetera they said okay I don't think that you're ready at this time to join Ostrom and then the second one came along its if you have my wife passed away two and it just it just broke my heart I was so devastated and it just still kind of recovering from it but I want to get serious with my spiritual life and take this opportunity for nausea he said we can accept you into Joshua because you know how to love and express emotion you just now we're going to direct its words
 Krishnan towards a higher higher higher place right like it your your emotions aren't shut off like you know how to love and be tender and care
and so that quality thanks for nothing I'm sorry like when I grow up and I actually like one on my own at a young age and just did music and turn never never look back really and I feel like you know what maybe I just don't know how to love now I'm thinking maybe it was loving person I know I know there's also knew I'd come on because I know you pretty well
 I don't know I've been accused of being a narcissist but people are not happy with me there's also that there's also the beautiful story in a proper and at a certain point we took Sydney office and you know he he he took that that phase of life or became her now so he came to America and one of his early
disciples asked I think it was it was John a key or someone they said do Armada Latina said probably have any children and he looked at her and said are you not my daughter
 is really sweet right and so you you recognize more than anybody I know give your life to other people because you love and care about them you know and you've had it situations where students maybe they drift away or they they they puke sometimes people turn on you at cetera and it hurts you and hurts you hurts you because you care if you want to give you right yeah but you but you scared because that you invest so much love into them you invest so much love in the people and so that's just your humility coming all right if you guys on the message board e if you guys think I'm at the two things have to rip it up.
51% and and how's do y'all doing today I put that on the board please, don't do that when I can't handle that totally not but I'm not sure if I have a house. Y'all doing she said totally not that we aren't sure what a day. We want it cleared thank you
 Karina wants to know what the narcissist narcissist okay you know if you are actually narcissists you wouldn't be asking if you are a narcissist be so self-involved there's a week
accused of it those are at those that that has been accused of being proud and arrogant than wanting to he said he's so not right quick to criticize my jar Sunday but you fall so just because someone didn't it's very humbling reflective of you dear my point was just that as you mention our hearts can softened when we come into the grass ashram right B being a brahmacharya sanyasi kind of them both of those experiences I was a brand new tire for 10 years you kind of have this General sense of compassion but when you get into a committed relationship or just any relationship you learn what it means to love a particular someone there was
read this book when my wife and I first got married
 it was Christian book about marriage the premise wasn't that marriage isn't necessarily supposed to make you happy it's meant to make you holy if it's a Sacrament is an ashram where you learn how to love more deeply and he said that if you want to be free to serve God and by all means don't get married because it takes up a lot of time but if you want to become more you mention Jesus more in the likeness of Jesus or in God's qualities than being married being in a relationship having kids is the best thing you could do because it teaches you how to love selflessly unlike everything else even non-human kids especially non-human wife gave birth to a child
 and I'm just worried is that normal
 we we we share all that we follow all the dog and counter there's like there's one mean that runs around with people ask if I was at a rescue dogs like but did you adopt your dog's I know he's our biological dog
anyway I guess there's dog accounts out there like your dog doesn't love you soon as someone else. Can I go home early
 yeah okay OK Google. You got the conclusion of so you're not as he was about to Dave yeah 25 years ago probably yeah I remember you getting a boxy 1992 or 95 no not that I was 2000 320 years ago 21 years ago 21 years ago
I lived in LA and he was a Brahma Cherry in Laguna Beach you would come over here yeah yeah I remember I came out for that. Was that one would like to G wrestling one of my guests give me bloody nose
 we are six being run us over here sitting on the couch outside and I look back or it's right up on the book back review goes what's going on in there it was too crowded showing moves to one of my guests and they're basically having a wrestling match in the living room I go I think it's okay but my friend likes to wrestle too yeah yeah I know you for a long time ever with thought you was born
 that's right she's more California right she was born in California while they are all born at my ex-wife's mother's home in in a mission
but your boy Michigan but if you had them when you're living in California and that just because you're accused of that by somebody you're supposed to say stuff right and it's important to be reflective about it for sure you know like if someone says you were just at the other do you want to see all I'm not that you're this but if it is it going to be erected but just because somebody says something right somebody says just because somebody says I don't feel loved doesn't mean they're not being loved just cuz I don't feel support is it means someone's not trying to support them right to somebody's feelings or experience of another person doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing that thing some people just have a difficult I'm feeling loved or feeling supported and it didn't it's both ways and so sometimes somebody can accuse you something and it's good for us to be reflected yeah cuz we can always all of us are a little self-centered or a lot self-centered or some
between all of us have some narcissistic Tendencies a singer of a band I can lean into just being entitled with certain things cuz you get things and people treat you a certain way you have fans you know maybe I can be a little narcissistic we all are okay alright money is so dear money is so dire that one conceives a money as sweeter than honey there for one who can give up the desire to humiliate money especially in household light bar who can who can who can give up a desire to accumulate money and household life
 BDubs or professional soldiers and Merchants try to acquire money even by risking their very dear life I have to read something to you yeah at 3 something to look at us like looking at me like don't you

 I want to go all in on the mission of helping people but do it all donation-based and leave my being taken care of and maintain to Chris and just worry about serving and giving
