 I had to get a kick out of that I think if you lived in a temple you just called the morning program so the late morning program think it's great I am words I change the name okay
 nugget nugget sir
I don't know how to pronounce his name is name is pronounced Vici George Ivanovic gorgeous gorgeous real name or if it's sort of like he was the guru is he Russian
 sounds like it you should have like a guru of sorts I wasn't going to tell you I pulled up something on here I've always curious about him but I've never read any of his books gorgeous right now you know we are the first and second middle name George. He just bumped by gorgeous
 do you want to hear about him or not yeah George Evanovich gorgeous
 1867 until 1949 was a philosopher you're going to love this guy the philosopher Mystic spiritual teacher composer of flies Into the Mystic that's my question when can I
do that in my bio I can tell you right here and let's see what it says Mystic is
 popularly known as becoming one with God or the absolute know that's mysticism anyway
 he was a philosopher of Mystic a spiritual teacher composer and a dance teacher
 and they have seizures okay now I'm interested he taught that the people are not conscious of themselves and us live their lives in a state of hypnotic walking sleep but then real hasta true this is true and it is possible to awaken to a higher state of consciousness and serve our purposes human beings and had a grade mustache
 yes he did all right what you got to say
. I'm happy this whole mustache and beard Revolution is comeback
self-knowledge without understanding the working and and functions of his machine man cannot be free he cannot govern himself and he will always remain a slave that something we would say that's one of our take away practically without self-knowledge without understanding without understanding the working and functions of his machine man cannot be free he cannot govern himself and he will always remain a slave that interesting no matter what you got you still going to be a Slave
 sure what is the highest freedom is the highest freedom is to understand that the senses in the body are not me that they're working sort of like like a shirt like a runaway train or better yet should have like a car going down a hill in San Francisco that things like a parallel park itself and you let go of the wheel of a hand
let's let go of the wheel of a of a of a car going down a hill in San Francisco that's like everybody's in danger and this is sort of the workings of the machine is it just goes off on its own tangents desires dragged here and there were subject to the desires of the media through my own karmic programming and we're almost like helpless almost as if we've been carjacked or there's not even a driver like where the passenger seat and there's not even a driver or just like hoping this car doesn't kill us and yeah and then we start to understand wait a second a real piece a real freedom
 it really has to do with how am I going to take control of the wheel again how am I going to jump into that driver seat again am I not going to just be in the stands but on the field so to speak and take a little bit of control in my life and part of that is to realize I don't have
control my lights are the part of that is to realize how much I take control my life I have partial control the best I can do is control my mind and senses and then I have to understand that there's a higher control also that I have to connect with two
 your Jeff
 I don't think Sprint unscrew Jeff Gordon georgieff I've been calling him go to Jeff 3 years old
 okay but you know as you were speaking organized what was coming to my mind was some
 oh you know Western Europe the Western yoga world right it's you know anyone can become a yoga teacher by taking yoga teacher training and now they're certified and and it's I suppose it's a temptation to begin to kind of present yourself as like a spiritual teacher
 you know like that
something that you didn't even get certified for her like a cheap certification for it's just like you're just kind of throwing out anything that sounds like it might be remotely spiritually know but you don't hear Too Many Western yoga teachers getting into likes real self-knowledge like that comes through the ogre tradition like what is the mind what it what it what it's different what are the different facets of the mind you know what is the money is what is the song called what is the booty right there on the impulsive mind that the ego has the intellect you know the reasoning for faculty what are some scar has you know how do they work in a lake without self-knowledge you know without noticing it all I'm I'm at the Sparks. What is the nature of the self you know
 but without that kind of self-knowledge oh I get it on the spark in the machine I need to understand how the machine functions that's where that's yogurt is kind of be getting there right now does it stink
how am I ever going to get it under control if I don't understand even what his parts are how it works
 and so you know Bhagavad Gita is going to start your right there you know November the throughout Bob's house and go through it and that's if it's an old unit it's in if you actually really get into these Traditions they go right there you know they try to help you understand that and then that knowledge that that understanding that okay I understand now I have some understanding about the Mind functions how it's not me how do I wouldn't slaves me how I can cover myself
 until I get control of it that knowledge is so helpful in that knowledge can give on the strength to actually become self-disciplined right at it I'd be in control I have to take the control back and that's that's where the kind of the rubber hits the road and spiritual life like okay I'm taking control now right I no longer just going to be control and
and the idea is to make sure that knowledge into wisdom right so that I not only know how the mind works and then some but I actually now have effortless control of it you know I've reprogrammed it also that's working for me rather than working against me that's part of what you always all about sounds like Guru Jeff code in on it I had imagined he was reading a bug of agita in a pound of shots and looks like that yeah it was I think once you start studying Eastern thought you become qualified to put the names Mystic on your bio
 what that can mean as far as when you sell a Christian Mystics yeah I think it can be one of your you're you you've taken an interest in written on and it looks paused on mysticism in Accra
text yeah I'm not even sure that you're not going to look up mysticism I just what is a Christian with us a Christian Mystic
 acoustro anyting healer
 are you a dealer
 what do you heal poison ivy
 what what what are your helmets are acapella Christian mysticism is the tradition of mystical practices and mystical theology within Christianity which quote concerns the preparation of the person for the consciousness of any effect of a direct and transformative presence of God or Divine love spiritual path not like a lot of Christians might just feel like I accept Jesus as my savior and now I'm saving you know that it's like where's like a Christian Mystic
 sand and plate of car
this is range from simple prayerful meditation of Holy scripture to contemplation on the presence of God resulting in theosis which is spiritual union with God and ecstatic visions of the souls mystical Union with God that's what I'm waiting for
 all right all right I think a little too whenever going to go straight to Hell Tagalog
 okay already want to get into the pocket on now

 text 3652
I believe we have learned mission is speaking at this point
 exciting
 there's Lord Vishnu
 in this world of matter which the condition Soul accepts as consisting of enjoyable resources
 the condition so expand thinking that he is they enjoy the material world similarly the material world expands the living entity as a source of enjoyment
 does that mean I think two things are being said here you all do the editing it seems to be a little bit I understand the first part of it so I think what it's saying is that the soul is seen as the enjoy our
and the world is seen as the object of enjoyment for the soul
 okay I get that
 in this way they both expand but because they are my energies is Lord isshin speaking they're both pervaded by me as a scream Lord I'm the cause of these effects in one should know that both of them rest
 you know what this reminds me of this reminds me of that we're having a party. His house if I can say it first then I get my realization of course it is I got your having a party at someone's house and you're using all their resources but you haven't invited them to their own house so we're just trying to avoid the resource material nature but we're ignoring Christmas edition is saying it's all mine don't you guys get it you're trying your best to be the enjoy it's not even yours you're not even creating it
you're the second hand God's that's what comes to mind I was thinking something similar is it kind of like a parent to Children kind of thing you know that some parents just get around all over I got a parent so I can do it from a from a from a detached perspective a good run all over and some parents are like kid here's the reality right like I haven't speak it and you're going to have to your you know what the world's not going to just to you you're about to just to the world okay and this is the way it is and so it this sounds a little bit kind of spoken in a in a relatively gentle way but just kind of like in a matter-of-fact way you know sometimes a parent have to say hey kids you know what it's not that way because you know I'm the one that's making all this happen and you know so here Christmas saying in it in the state of Illusion in this whole dream like state in this whole uninformed state
 we see ourselves as the injuries of the world
and we see the world as the object of our enjoyment right so we miscalculate we miss categorize these two very important you know categories and increasing I'm you know what let me just share a bit with you you know both both of you the Geva the soul and the world that you're in I produce them both me over here not only that I provide them both like my Consciousness has penetrated them you can't say that I can't say that right and not only that there are also supposed to pour to buy me to your supported by me you know that that's the kind of thing a parent's house right now you know what you can make your own the kids said I mean like I'm going to take my car and I'm going to get out of here are you going to take the car that I paid for that I paid for the insurance and I just change the oil in that's the car you going to take and if you know even when parents die
that it may hopefully it's being done in a in a mood that sound loving ultimately right but it's like hey you need to hear some reality for your own good while the reality check is if the parent stop paying for the car stopped paying for the insurance and then they get pulled over reality comes crashing down so we either there's either a sweet surrender and acceptance of a higher authority in okay I'm getting my needs met from this higher authority and I ain't going to appreciate the higher authority or the whole thing's going to implode on itself eventually send you suffer when they suffering you don't have her you would sweetly but it's going to happen anyway that there's a reality check going to have this is what we're doing in our spiritual practice is just like there's information given you can take this information or you can fight it and say you know this is 24 nautical distance to intensive bars To Hai poke in formation of the material world was just giving us the information of the world
we can take as much as you want roses too overwhelming I'll take a little bit it's okay you can't change the rules you can just
 can't bring my camera you have to delete you can only break yourself against the rules to break the rules themselves that sometimes you meet the doctor that's like that right just that's kind of like hey I know what to tell people they don't always listen to me so whatever it's up to you you know yeah yeah yes you can pay now or pay later to change your diet your lifestyle at cetera or it just going to fall apart remember that one day you can pay me now or pay me later or pay later or something or car kind of thing so it's just me talking it's me that's coming from a later it's not a minus commercial I think with something like that you can pay me now you can pay me later in other words you can hear the the wisdom that I'm sharing with you now that will help
and you're suffering down the line it was my wisdom teeth white with silk it's like the pay now pay later rocking off the television advertisement you can pay me now or pay me later where can I get to the bottom of this year I going to have it just going to say it's when motivation speaking it with loving Detachment you know that's the mood that there's no it is not trying to twist the knife and you know but but it's with love right now you stopped what happened
 a serious about this I told her that I wrote her private message don't you do that you just say so I can. You just say you love me you say it's rocket not okay set show in any case again you know what this you know what the whole thing reminds me of when we had a we had to make this a postular something like that
the world is we're talking about this last show the world is not our Paradise it's our University right I'm not the enjoy your on the student here Mighty Nana said it was an old Midas Muffler commercial from the 70s in the auto mechanic and you used it again I upcycle that you never heard of going to take something to hold you make it new make a fresh ahead and pay later right now but any case you know the world is in our Paradise it's our University OK Christmas and you think you're the enjoy your that's not what you're doing here you're here to learn something you know you think this world is men to do for your German you know what is going to be suffering marijuana look up Paradise or university and see if that where that's from think he came up with it
about that actually looks like your realization has any case a little cup called from Krishna they're not not that dumb
 not that it it it needs to be hard right now but I can search Kaiser he's he knows this but still vision is speaking for all of us
 text aneri to search and she said she's fine. Nothing has come up
 alright so simple a similarly the material world expands the living in today there's a supreme Lord I'm the cause of these effects in one should know that both of them Rest in Me My 53 and 54 when a person is in deep Sleep he dreams and he sees himself in many other objects such as great mountains or and rivers
or perhaps even the entire universe although they are far away sometimes when one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form lying in his bed and one place that empty right after I back here
 then he sees himself in terms of various conditions as belonging to a particular nationality family and so on so I can see like I woke up and I realized here I am you know I'm American in a part of the family so on so forth
 all the conditions of deep sleep dreaming and wakefulness are bananer G's of the Supreme personality of godhead what should always remember the original creator of these conditions the Supreme Lord whose unaffected by them always remember that okay let's read a little pretty cool stuff me like this versus very good stuff good this Prophet racist
 nah nah
these conditions that this deep sleep dreaming wakefulness none of these conditions of the living and none of these conditions of the living as a Stanley deep sleep dreaming and wakefulness is substantial that's like a really heavy statement like even the wakefulness insubstantial because he's got a whole another perspective of what reality is what what what do you know fully aware Consciousness is and from that perspective are wakeful our normal wakefulness is a dream itself you know when I think that I am Chris tube of an American you know New Yorker that is all just as insubstantial as anything in a Dream from from the perspective of reality they're simply displays of various phases of conditional life
conditional life right
 there may be many mountains rivers trees B's tigers and snakes that are situated far away
 but in a dream when we imagine them to be nearby
 similarly as one has subtle dreams at night when the living entity is similarly as one has settled dreams at night when the living entity is awake he lives in Gross dreams of nation Community Society possessions skyscrapers
 and one's got a few things balanced position and honor under the circle and under the circumstances one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world just like I know I know oh I'm experiencing it's because I'm in deep sleep
 you know why I'm flying through the air or whatever cuz I'm in deep sleep because of my
with this particular phase of awareness I'm experiencing something so simply we can say I feel myself as Chris tuba in America excetera because I'm in contact with the material world
 one is situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy which works under the direction of the Supreme personality of godhead there for the Supreme Lord is the Altar and after and the conditioned living entity should simply remember
 this original actor shree Krishna
 that's all we need to learn in this University right let my awareness go to that Divine loving being behind it all let that let that become the focus in my thoughts with my meditation
 none of these conditions of the living entities namely deep deep sleep dreaming and wakefulness
 do you say twice
maybe I messed up I think I
 pasted it twice so I'm going back in the same thing okay
 just want to read that that's rather text no nothing nothing
 text 55 nobody know me to be the same Brom on the all-pervading super-soul through whom the sleep sleeping living in today can understand his dreaming condition and his happiness beyond the activities of the material senses that is to say I am the cause of the activities of the sleeping living being the activities of the sleeping living being yeah you know like again like if I'm in
I have if you are listening you are in a
 virtual reality and I'm the one that is kind of coating the whole thing right then I can I can say the conditions that you are and you're sitting here at Union you're in the first round you say because I decided to do this this is the result that I created and I'm and I'm sitting here I know you don't care that I created that imaginary sword I created the bowling imaginary bowling alley here in whatever the virtual reality is is when I know that's like a bowling alley in and I can manipulate it in any way that I want you know that 56 if one's dreams during sleep are merely subject matters witnessed by the Super Soul
 how can a living entity who is different from the Super Soul remember the activities of dreams. That again
 if one's dreams during sleep or merely subject matters Witness by the Super Soul
how can a living entity who is different from the Super Soul remember the activities of Dreams the experiences of one person cannot be understood by another there for the nowhere of the facts the living entity who inquires into the incidence manifested in dreams and wakefulness is different from the circumstantial activities
 that knowing factor is Vermont in other words the quality of knowing belongs to the living entities and to the Supreme soul
 that's the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams and wakefulness
 both stages the nowhere is unchanged but it is qualitatively one with the Supreme Vermont
 I don't quite understand that hurts would have to go to the whole thing again I wasn't getting any then I will sleep good and anything I tried again
what I would just really like brizo if I didn't have the accountability of used to be next to me here I just Breeze through it like okay didn't didn't register I'm going on it's not a good it sounded like let's try it I was just trying to talk about I'm just slow down a bit sometimes you can let me read it my sense of time and you listen to me right now
 if one's dreams during sleep or merely subject matters Witness by the Super Soul
 how can a living entity was different from the super so remember that the activities of dreams okay I don't know who's claiming that
 dreams are only Witness by the Super Soul that's that's a little confusing right there not sure why that's being presented but in any case the fact that we also remember our dreams indicates that we are perceiving them with the singer the experiences of one person can
be understood by another therefore the knower of the facts the living entity
 inquires into the incidence manifested in dreams and wakefulness is different from the circle circumstances that circumstantial activities I'm different from my dreams
 I am different from my circumstances okay that knowing Factor the factor that I know it the fact the factor that I possess knowledge of something separate for myself and knowing factor is Brahmin because I'm conscious because I'm spirit I perceive in other words the quality of knowing the longs to living entities and to the Supreme Soul okay dreams don't know circumstances don't know only Spirit knows
 thus the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams of wakefulness not only the super-soul but we can also because we're made of spirit and both stages the no
is unchanged
 but the quality but is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman
 that weird I suppose it would be interesting to read some of the commentaries on this but it seems to be saying because we are made of spirit we we perceive and we know
 text 5757 what a living when a living entity that's us thinking himself different for me forgets his spiritual identity of qualitative one that's with me in eternity knowledge and Bliss his material condition life begins when he thinks himself
 not one with the Supreme decide a qualitatively one not quantitatively but I'm made of the energy of God so in that sense one sure that other words instead of identifying as interest with mine it becomes interested in this bodily expansions
but his wife is children's material possessions husband lessons
 in this way by the influence of his actions 11 body comes from another after one death another death takes place in this way by the influence of his actions one body comes from another and after one death another death takes place what does that mean so it's saying that we are qualitatively one with God so we were made of the same energy and have the same qualities of God which means every Journal by Nature we are where we are conscious and full of knowledge by nature and we're Blissful by Nature that's that's what we're made of
 but it says some but if we think ourselves not made of that energy if I think I am this body
 watch once we do that we forget our Spears
are you a camera right now to regular
 still waiting on your back is forgetfulness of that forgetfulness of my being made of spirit the forgetfulness of my being made of the energy of God the conscious
 energy of God when I forget that that forgetfulness causes transmigration is that forgetfulness that is okay I just need to be reminded of who I am and feel again who I am and the transmigration stops I don't take birth in the next Monday but as long as I think I am the spine and forgetful of that connection then I'm free then I move through this world see myself as the enjoy your of it and as it as the object of my enjoyment and and threw acting to try to enjoy that world I got entangled in by the law of karma that every action I do with that kind of motive
a reaction which manifests in taking on body after body after body
 I know you're locked in
 that's really it isn't it sometimes like yep that's the truth sometimes it sometimes it's like a puzzle
 it's the story of my life here all of her any locks
 when a living entity 58 human being a human being can attain perfection in life by self-realization Through The Vedic literature and his practical application okay so it just gave us a talked about the nature of our bondage some sorrow birth after birth taking on different bodies now we're hearing about the way out
 this is pi
especially for human being born in India the land of piety
 it really has landed by it if you know what I mean it's a land of time yesterday when I came back from The Jug North Monday or I got back to
 Sri chaitanya changer.io mundeer the temple that I'm you know living right near
 you know it's Christmas now I don't know if like Christian Evangelical Christians fought to get like India to recognize Christmas as a national holiday thinking that it would promote Christianity but it may have backfired because it hinders are taking this day and Runnin With It many people in that Temple last night I've never seen it so fat you cuz everybody gets it out the day off
 I don't understand because of Christmas more than Indiantown everyone gets
Miss off and they all go to the Hindu temples like that was like the busiest day of the year practically it in the temple really it was like it was waves out of like
 Duty I think I feel like they go out I'd like to their joy in their passion I like I always went to church like you know it's Sunday go to church you know what I mean like like let's do our lives show up you know and it's a holiday we got to show got to go to the midnight mass but it's not like that it's more like all we get a chance to go to the temple with excitement to it is jammed in this mass of humanity you know it ended I was just about to leave the temple and and they had you know no private space personal space get about it. Just forget about it it was it was beyond that and and I was just about to go out the door and end in on the huge altar with his beautiful Rider
Krishna Radha madhava I mean in and then they have the 80 piece with them it's just these people except in the template never seen a temple like this is like it oh my God look at Rod and Chris and all the gopis this is blowing my mind it's like there's a room with like just a pilgrims that are going in there yeah. Like between both sides of the temple is probably like at least six thousand people crammed and then there's like a river of people that are like going in one side and out the other have an introvert's like you and Mara deal with that for me it's like a big bun moshpit I've always been into that kind of thing
 so so I may be a growing it. So that is what happened this was so cool and they had kind of like a half curtain up so you could only see like that the altar from like that the waist up
and because they were doing this because they're making an offering there on the alright right and instant and still there's like all of this
 all of this devotional bustle getting all this devotional energy in the room like coming from thousands of people there and then and then when the offering was done the picture I came out blow a conch
 and took that car down in the place exploded.
 The whole blood and I'm just saying this is incredible these people are so moved or so inspired christian all the gopis they're just like this is the most beautiful thing we've ever seen because the the temple itself just from a material standpoint what is it it's like a big room and then there are these statues and back
materialist would see that the first spiritualist so much more is happening that you can't even explain to a person like what if we were like how many people do that at a museum how many people go to the museum and whatever it is something happening there's something happening and it's exciting and we are so hard to excite in in Western culture we have to go to like a 3D movie with sensurround or we need we need a replacement well cycling anymore or even just hiked amount that we have to like Marie was it called the base jump from the mountain because there's a base jump from that man just like
show me it's got to go ahead for us to get any excitement of it all the kids were playing baseball that was a boring as we loved it we used to sit there and keep stats a baseball games and then of course there is but it could be in that Outfield and not do anything the entire game playing like Centerfield not do anything just stand there that's the support that yeah now it's now they have used enough
 whatever like mixed martial arts words like teams of people fighting each other ever see those guys like Five Guys on Five Guys that's the only way we can even hold her attention what's the price of the baseball who goes to baseball games today
 it would keep saying that recognizes if no one is going to baseball games they wouldn't be
how to make money from it and they're paying baseball player has more money than they've ever been paid like insane I think I know I think a baseball player was just signed for at 7 p.m. dworak
 hey that was historic
 okay anyway things are getting more extreme though
 let's go let's get back to text by teenager
 text 59-58 a man who obtains birth in such a convenient position but does not understand his self is unable to achieve the highest perfection even if he is exalted to life in the higher planetary systems remembering University learn focus on learning ally
 you should take that one if you want you can take it that's yours
this is not a you just don't like it anymore and you were into it you made it up yourself and no credit to anyone who came up with that it's because of the payment or pay me later thing yeah I forget we can forget that I said that let's just forget that I said that that's you that's all you
 I might have just made up my own my maybe I've never heard that commercial it doesn't mean that it couldn't have been said some other time in history that that you're right you're entirely right remembering running trouble remembering the great trouble found in the field of activities performed for proven results and remembering how one receives the reverse of the results one desires man you got that remembering the great trouble found in the field of x
he's performed for Fruita results okay you know I'm working hard to try to get stuff and I'm just kind of troubles for me of the results Evelyn's of one desires I thought I had my heart's desire and I had my heartbroken one for this whole thing and weather for material actions and yesterday was just like I haven't talked to her in like
 35 years a long time ago but not but after in California if I have to talk to me like I'm 30 years together but you don't eat all day today I know you don't know him but anyway how's your wife
I'm not with this white but I have another wife but that didn't work out and I know what it is it's just like I missed massive chapters of his life
 let's just all failed it. I mean it's just like the material world we have these expectations we're going to go through with it it's going to pay off it does it's a reverse of what you thought it would be it's like he's tripping breaking your leg gets like I wasn't planning on it and now I'm sitting here
 yes it's a side panel that although this could be like a whole show that we can go into this but you know
 in an effort to kind of twist this world and break it open so that we can really enjoy it
 we end up throwing tradition out the window right
 finish and and granted tradition can be used to exploit in cradle kind of problems but your kind of holds things together to glue and no
open right now and I will said it's something nice. Tradition and you know
 like you live with your family you never went too far away for them to live there were always like that with a lot of family that I need to break away and there's more money over there so I'll fly across the country you know some type of stability at all levels you know into in terms of questions about gender you know in terms of family and again I only meant that you know it gets exploited misuse and what kind of way but when you throw it out the window by the same as to improve it that's fine tune it lets tweak it you kind of like let's blow it up and then life is really going to be fun and we could be free and what how is that we are really think that tradition has been holding us back and stopping us from her freedom. I guess it depends on what the tradition is
back to this the tradition is saying
 and I'm sorry to say it again right now it's it's it's it's the universe or something and you say this place is Medford to meet for me to enjoy and your tradition is holding me back from enjoying so throw out the tradition and now now the world to give you the messages you need it has to have your with you it said that looks like a parent that's like saying oh man you could have just listened to what I said but now I got to start to punish you know and so we're just punishing ourselves ultimately
