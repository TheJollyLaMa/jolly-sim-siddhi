I had to put that one in to get that one in the in the on the roster
 how are you ready for nugget I'm ready my friend whose in August around this is from
 can you do it I'm a little behind today
plug in all the computer stuff you know what that is like like setting up an office and a very difficult thing to do and it just takes a little time today I think it's a beautiful nugget pregnant
 and it's coming from coming from is it Australian Aboriginal proverb
 you ready yeah I'm trying to think like is it like all of them said that it was their one wise Aboriginal who said it wasn't all of them everybody every every Aboriginal person say this thing is there one like Benjamin Franklin of the Aboriginal Aborigines in Australia with one person and that gets passed around popularized
 Siri right now show me up here at the the Australian Aboriginal people
they say that we are all visitors to this time and this place
 we're just passing through
 our purpose here is to observe
 to learn
 to grow
 to love
 and then we returned home I love it but I'm thinking now I love
 why do we only take the things that are positive uplifting spiritual things from their culture like if there's a lot of Americans we want to quote you know we quote you know Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson pain quote like you know the Charles Manson's and crazy people in this world are people too when we quote that why we always quoting don't you think there is any crazy people that
Originals I think it's just being silly right and I want to hear what you think about this you know well I'm just saying we tend to filter out of course we filter out what do you say of course we filter it out come on man I get an account with it with it what I think you said I think that's a great thing I think that lines up exactly with what we say and it's a it's as if he's reading the same books we are and probably takes a lot of people who reflect on life people to see the world in such a bigger picture than their own life as likely the beginning middle and end of things who can zoom out and see that a while I am actually so tiny even compared to this chestnut tree which is lived for many human generations and that we're all just visitors here doing some time trying to grow I get that it's beautiful it is it some
yeah you know I assume they weren't reading the same books that we were reading you know but there are as they could even if I don't know if they could even read you know or if they could read any language that are texted been written but I think you're right it's like thoughtful people
 can somehow access the truth right it's like when one is very sincere and really wants to understand God is here in the heart of every living being into reveal those same kind of truce and and this is just like a a nice neat little summary of it you know it hit it starts at the beginning and then it feels right up to the highest principle in a soil that were visitors to this time and this place right this time and their space and we all find ourselves at a particular time at a particular place certain circumstances that we find herself in life and the thought that this is a key this is this is like
 the kind of stuff that even though like
our society is supposed to be so advanced
 that this fundamental stuff we are don't even consider I'd like what are we what is life all about what are we doing here in the world it and here's a thought we're passing through this but we have it but there's a purpose that every living being is meant to go through a particular when you hit the human form you got the ability to do this do that to observe observe your circumstances of his heir of the people around you observe nature observe your own body and mind and learn who's going to be lessons who's going to be patterns is going to be information that can be drawn from this going to be all kind of wisdom Traditions that you have access to through through the lenses of those you can observe this world and try to understand it more deeply try to see what you're meant to learn
 and through what through that you're meant to grow you know you meant to grow here means
 understand things more.
Ali and therefore your character begins to be molded by that deeper understanding you let go of your lower nature you enhance and pins bring out your higher nature and where does that lead ultimately to love it when you learn what love really is and when you make yourself capable by letting go up so much of your own selfishness and ignorance when you really become capable of loving then you returned home then you're ready you know it like then then you achieve achieve the purpose of it all that's what Bob what time is presenting to us as well bug of agita is presenting that's all great with some cultures of star understand love is the highest I want like I wonder what Australian Aboriginal thought the goal was like it was their idea sounds like you to come to that place where you able to log in then you return home
 that's a go
 yeah I've never studied their teaching so much outside of a few quotes
there's a 140 you know it end end what if
 what if we kept this kind of attitude that are for fun or kept this kind of understanding that what am I meant to learn how am I meant to grow am I becoming more capable of loving it that's what I meant to do here that's what I meant to do to rather we think like where am I going to find my Pleasures where how will I squeeze I got to punch out of this we live in this world with a few questions on repeat on auto auto repeat their head in a sum of its like where am I going to eat we're going to meet you know where we going to make some money but how can I love better more true or what does honesty mean how can I relate to people better how can I learn from that what do you know what is the lesson here is our questions what were questioning on a regular basis because a little bit and if we tweak them we become a whole another person that's right are our advancement is preceded by the
the right kind of questions right and so what kind of questions are we asking you are we asking questions that just have to do with how we derive pleasure through our senses which are like you're saying how do I make more money how do I made on a higher-level how do I you know I enjoy food on a higher level how do I enjoy Comfort on a higher level that's where a question is going what we're saying last week just polished animal polished
 they're not wearing glasses because I'm polish that wear glasses but otherwise I'm going to animal sniffing around same questions sniffing liking things makes up a hey man I forgot to tell you that cuz I haven't talked to you in a few days I met this super cool guy
who was I think you are in love with him how I sort of am and he is he's a famous from Bosnia who's who's discover these Bosnian pyramids everybody YouTube search the Bosnian pyramids and he has so much incredible alternative archaeology pyramid information and me and all the kids we went into these tunnels into these pyramids in the middle of the woods and it was super cool and if we're going for kilometers and kilometers and you can bring the way they built these tunnels it keeps fresh are constantly recycling so you can breathe in there it is a complete squirrel but I thought I find it interesting I thought you'd find it interesting
 a very interesting right now did you know that pyramids warrant for tombs that was a complete speculation.
Judy Gibson parents all pyramid pyramids all over the world Fusion. Paramedics weren't Tunes now that you were somewhere else why would they build a giant megalithic Marvel for somebody it wasn't like that the tools were somewhere else and somehow it got wrapped into that but pyramids have special potency and its pyramids all over the world King's cutter wasn't in what appears now that was disinformation look at it shoot it was just going now now he know he knows he's in the club I can let you in the club cuz I don't want to it's okay if you don't understand the power pyramid
 anyway I want everyone to just YouTube search Bosnian pyramids we were in those tunnels and I met the guy and we just had a
we had a bromance on the musket the time which is our means of Conquest Wichita prospective patients used to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Singh to being a mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and she'll be off today of the author unit Jim Bakker at Save-A-Lot bag of the teeth with them to look at the heart of the democratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord whose praise the transmittal songs we established as a revocable fact when we get them done this year duck shoot from Nana cuz my street
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teacher to opening my eyes at the port side of knowledge my OfferUp bass and sees they are Lotus feet
I don't know where we are consumed until we are at to Humbug to Tom chapter 7 can to 11:15 and 11:15 instead of speaking the Great Sage Naruto
 yudhistira the great king you just his asked him give me instructions share with me about the organization of society write this far nausea and Dharma how how how how how Society is organized in such a way how different individuals according to their to their aptitudes and proclivities and in mine sets
 what duties they should embrace what are their responsibilities in in such a way that
don't serve one another and move forward spiritually something that became warped into a tool impression known today as the caste system but just because people miss you something doesn't mean there's not some kind of Brilliance behind sure and so there's there's a lot to gain from you know as we move through the selection here right now I just can't not going to comment on let's just not even go on my only comment is that just imagine
 if as a society we weren't all like
 fighting each other's backs that we just had a bit more calm amongst us and we could try to understand try to come to a point where we had some shared values right what's important to us as a people you know and end in this culture they had that idea you know we we threw our philosophy
we've asked all the questions and in general we share the idea that there must be a Creator behind this did you know brilliant design of this universe
 that has the aboriginals were tapping into you know they were meant to learn lessons in this world and ultimately Were Meant to develop a selflessness that that's that's necessary for love which is our highest principle OK do we all share that yet okay do we also recognize that we have different aptitudes and that's a side requires different roles we do okay let's train people let's recognize those those aptitudes are those mine sets in people even when we were young let's instill within them at the coke codes
 that help wanted that. Kind of them reinforced
 our ability to care for one another you know so that our ideas of success
have to do with Healthcare and we are he'll protect and we are you know how wise we are let lets instilled electric train people in that even from a young age so that you know imagine if if if our presidential candidates were all like we've all gone through the educational process for what it means to be a leader we we all and we all share the values that are there that the leader needs to be the following right they need to have a certain strength to certain power they also need to be very caring they need to listen to wise people they they need to be willing to sacrifice for the good of the people make that their highest principle excetera excetera they need you know in the end they said when they were giving their speeches and so on they were saying you know I'm I'm dedicated to upholding these higher principles
 it rather than just like trying to tear each other down in the most infantile ways you know
you're a jerk you're a jerk you're a jerk but people here online you can Google it that's say you're the biggest hey I'm here's a simplest one about the caste system and like where things went wrong and just one tiny element if you wanted to Claire war on another country you and your children have to fight in that war that's it that would solve so many problems if you want to be the warrior if you want to be the leader of the world of your nation of your of your country of your kingdom you're the first on the battlefield and it's how many wars would stop right there it would certainly give people pause when it yeah we live in a society
we're business the free market is like our big principal and and we want business to be able to flourish because we think that through you know acquiring wealth will achieve happiness and what happens is big business is particularly what are they called the military-industrial complex and they're all making money for more that they're making money for Mora said that ends and they are dead for years ago and they invest in in the campaigns of both sides military-industrial complex makes money either way no matter who wins or losses so this was a night when we think of this varunastra just think of it just think of this like college right that like there'd be professors in the different fields of leadership
 yeah and that they were based on these ancient wisdom texts
and in that Society had the shared values and end your your character would ideally be molded through that you know so that if you are big business person you in still deep within you was was an ethic you know that my responsibility you know I've got this ability to make money but my responsibility and what I'm respected for in society is how well I care for my employees and for the rest of society by giving charity you know rather than what we have now which is like I'm respected just for making tons of money and being a noxious
 so what so what what what is outlining his within the society there three different types of leaders
 there's the Business Leaders would you today we call the one who called like a job producers or something like that job creators are people that own business
Jeff they list three categories of people that don't get paychecks they don't work for paycheck that's the fourth category is called Shoot you right where I have a way that he's been laid out as you have a master right and when we hear that word we we don't like that at all but the idea is that ultimately that's what if we get a monthly paycheck at a business and it says what we're doing is we found a master that's willing to pay us and we know do what they order us to do it the same thing we're doing anyway. You're doing it to have freedom when you step outside of those work hours to theoretically but but you have to follow them and so you know when we will get to that as you read it but like the baby saying get your job if you do that is to satisfy your master and when we hear that we sent all my God what kind of like serfdom where they talk about know we all are living in that world people wake up if you're not a person that gets a paycheck.
that goes out like you do on your own then you could be a business leader which means you create your own business you could be a political leader which means you can't accept people or you could be a spiritual leader that has his incredibly simple life and they live off the charity or the donations of the people who appreciate their gifts so that's what's being laid out here in and why do we talk with start with text 13
 those who have been reformed by the garbage on ceremony and other prescribed performance Harry methods before with Vedic mantras and without interruption and who have been approved by Lorde for ma or do BJ's or the twice-born when when it says
 performed without interruption I'm not sure but that might indicate and others
through the generations has been handed down without being broken right you know you know okay yeah by the garbage ceremony which you know one very significant thing that's going to come out in this chapter is nard is going to say that these roles in society are based on one's character on Once a marriage that birth is not the the prerequisite although here it's saying the viticulturist bounce right it's saying that ultimately it is your character in your confidence that determine the role that you play but they also recognize that the family that you're born and it will have a lot to do with the development of your character in your confidence sure and then people people don't get this in this is what they have that people have issues with that system that you marry within your community and this is like sort of like a new generation that there is marrying outside of your community but we if you can see it
animals how we do it we we raised like I have a labrador Labrador meant to retrieve they're also very smart and they can do things like a medical dogs that can tell if your blood sugar is low they can be trained for diabetes yeah golden retriever certain dogs protect certain does a great service dogs and they've been raised on the dogs just don't do anything or bloodline Must ALL become very valuable or race horses are pure bloodline we get it with animals for horses for dogs for in a winter show roosters and there's a ship for a particular type of wall so there's a reason why you have particular bloodline because it gives a different physical material results be on the bloodline is just the training that you get in that family right within that and but summer better for certain things that's for sure she was in the human level like you
the human level if you're born into the bloodline of Warriors of the letter is not a diplomatic but you read it again and again about marrying and don't marry outside of your cast and after why was right well this is part of that I think it also has to do with the harmony in the couple because you know if if if you if you marry someone that's just from a drastically different culture than you it's going to be challenging you know it in the more that you are similar and early really challenging the more similar it is it's going to create a greater sense of ease in those were in the connection does that mean we as individuals are bound by that stereotype people who are a very unique to their stereotype and we're ultimately Spirits also we can transcend even our body
in her mind and her proclivity Zimmer not found in cement by stereotype of generally almost like a little racist like they're say don't you know not just in India but a lot of Asian cultures are still really into marrying within communities and there's there's a reason behind it and it's not just because we've elevated the idea of freedom as being the highest principle not everybody has done had her we just freedom to find your pleasure out of life and and so we we put that has the highest thing and then we and then that becomes informed by movies and television and blah blah blah and we have you known incredibly High divorce rate and we have a lot of trouble with our families together and also our concept of free and often times it's based on Carmel carnal desires not on some higher
that's why the idea of parents saying you know what Mary within this family and that's what the parents and all those cultures would arrange the pain which would arrange the marriage has his their older they're less driven by there hopefully less driven by a little pleasures and so you know what this will be a better match for you were going to marry with into the into this family and that's going to hit and families you understood you're not marrying an individual like in our culture you marry an individual you isolate yourself from that your family back then you're marrying into families so you know if you were you and you know if you and me were married say a second like I have a relationship with your P your parents and your sister and your and in the environment dynasties we create dynasties to arrange it's arranged marriage Tuesday here so
 Samara
okay so where we going that we talked about the brahmins in cuz she was making this point like it's not just uninterrupted in this lifetime and meet people who've been practicing life for a lifetime as their twice-born essentially what that means is they've graduated from the college and they taken on the new life you know it's like they've got the training they're for they're called wedges or twice born entered into another
 Arena of Life another stage of life where they've achieved education for the cultures around the world have that Jews have that right choice presidents that were born again in life but this was very specific training for leadership yeah, this charger is and vice Shabbos those are the lights to the spiritual leaders political leaders or rulers and Business Leaders
yeah purified by their family traditions okay so they're doing all the rights you know all that you know that that a family would do to cultivate this character relate to a family tradition like family traditions in America like well we have a pig roast on 4th of July
 and by their behavior big one should Worship the Lord study The Vedas and give charity all the all the all three categories of leaders need to do this this is what they're passing down to their children yes this is their real inheritance they need to be charitable they need to be spiritual and they need to study these these sacred text
 in this is that's where the ethics are coming from that's where the values are coming from
 what's going to happen to this world in this system they should follow
principles of the four ashrams brahmacharya Greek pasta and some students controlled student life not like our high school right yes grihastha means like a spirit of America responsible marriage retiring from your business Let It Go sex letting go of money now you're being cared for by the younger ones in the family and and husband or wife or dedicated to deep spiritual practice and give me some guidance to the younger ones and then like
 this world is a dream and I'm just going to go out and find god listen to us so here it is two groups of four right one is your Varna your your occupation again you know that
list three different types of leaders and then there's the people that work for the leaders and then also four stages of life that you passed through that and again in each one of your responsibilities your duties are clearly laid out and they're Progressive they make a lot of sense there to help you help cultivate your higher nature and let go of your lower nature
 32 * 14
 a king or Brahman their six occupational duties
 you know what else you want me to read what those are right now it's worth that Chase ATM chapter I know that the fort the occupations not the know yet what are the occupations of a Brahmin so it's worshipping the DD you do by performing the rituals and teaching others how to perform those rituals for studying The Vedic literature and teaching The Vedic literature to others accepting charity
giving charity to others that those are the duties of the brahmas
 okay I think I got that stuff to charity getting charity worshipping TD teaching how to worship the DD and studying The Vedas and teaching the base area is not allowed to Levy taxes I promise ruler yeah but he may perform the other five of these duties okay so that's significant ride the church is not accepting charity but he can sit you can still give charity this what one part of the brilliance
 of this way to culture is it going to rain tonight like we have this thing now we we call it toxic masculinity
 when we chat and you know what I believe there is such a
toxic Mitten masculinized States when you believe that you're insensitive insensitivity towards others is like a virtue it's like I just push myself away around in and that should be admired that that's toxic masculinity but masculinity itself isn't the problem it's only when it becomes toxic we try to counter it by just rooting out all the masculinity out of a man or there should be no mask like the whole idea of Yin Yang that there's a balance between now and it's so they were they recognized the value masculinity and they also recognize that certain men
 it's really runs deep in and rather than try to root it out of them it's like let's refine it in them and use it for good rather than for harm right so part of that you do like a warrior when you would look at a warrior right
you is it you know like now a warrior becomes like a professional athlete or South correct just like you know because it has a lot of the challenge in the physical battle that like is deep in their bones you know sometimes a big brawny guy freaking girl can't can be like filled with rage so they're ready to fight the ready to step in the ready to sand it down and give it given sure it's like you know where we don't always see it but like in sports are working well it's like this athletes they have the Disco live like sportsmanship you know and and they have ways of inspiring one another to to act selflessly on the quote Uncle battlefields you know and that kind of thing is Martin it does build
so but you know like say you got a guy like Tom Brady right he's probably like 6 ft 3 right very handsome you know why did you light up when I said that I just like to hear you say courageous you know what it's like to stand there in the pocket as a quarterback why like these shoes got vicious guys are just like I paid High salaries to kill you with a cool head focus on your mission and and you know like find your receiver you know it's like you got courage you know you got a lot and when you walk down the street like when Tom Brady walk down the street people are taking notice you know it's like oh that's Tom Brady that's the guy that performed all these two roads looking in my God it's huge it's like you know so when you've got that body and that
 that's that
the character the kind of excites people you're going to develop this ego right it's it's only natural yeah it's only natural the ethics did the cold that comes with the charger is their humility towards the to the Wimpy little spiritual guy that's full of wisdom and renunciation right like that that they went when when the skinny little Brahmin with his books walks and they bow down and part of recognizing their egos they don't accept charity know I don't accept charity I go out and produce right and I give to charity like that's part of like they're at the that's why when are June in the bag of you just said right the beginning I feel like putting down my ball went in and living by begging I can think that would be better it's like oh where is this coming from you know you're the warrior you're the one that's meant to give charity not accept her I got a question for you sir yeah they're so you know
 here I am
and here we all are and we're not from the like pure Bloodlines should have been passing down for Generations what value does the study of the of the barn is an ashram 4:30 me who is basically some type of panel mutt you ever look at a dog like what kind of dog is he a part at ball maybe or in a pound so forth so muddy how we supposed to figure out where we fit into this or should we just not think about this and say you know why can't we just move forward like this is such an important question their two considerations right the one is that there's a Brilliance in this
 psychology of personality types and understanding it can help one be successful and serve in this world it end end and 2
grow in this world 2-2 to evolve in this world if it's clear that have with my psychology that I have certain weaknesses and these codes address those weaknesses and bring out the best in me that's going to be very helpful but what you're saying is so true that we don't live in a world that even recognizes this stuff so maybe imposing it too much is just working too hard and maybe what we're doing then is as as you have you shared with us or not is majoring in minor things because parallel to this what The Bob & Tom is going to illustrate so well is that even at the end of the bug of agita Christmas spends the bulk of you telling Arjuna recognize your nature
 you are Warrior by Nature
 follow that but do it with knowledge and attachment and ultimately devotion right then at the very end of the bug of agita Christian more or less as you know what all the duties that were talking about all the dharma's that were talking about the
imma being a warrior and all that abandoned at all
 and Just Surrender unto me
 right and I'll protect you from all I'll protect you from your lower nature I'll protect you from any reactions to your lower nature you know so the highest principle is always at Krishna factor that all of these ethics and culture meant to bring one to give your life entirely to God with love and the world is complicated if you're having trouble doing it then just do that right if this is serving that then embrace it and if it's too complicated and let it go and just make sure you give your life wholeheartedly to God it's nice to have that as our dropped pin as our guiding message like keeping that main thing of Krishna bhakti is this helping my Krishna bhakti I'm a spirit so am I forgetting that now as I get distracted from this other role that I play in this world because when Arjuna was put under these very difficult circumstances he began to think of these duties in terms of his own material happiness
he was sick it seems to me like if I fight this battle I won't be happy if I win and I won't be happy if I lose and Christmas saying what's going to make you happy externally materially is not at all the consideration right we do our duty weather weather is going to be pleasant or unpleasant you do with the conviction that by serving by always serving even under difficult circumstances we evolve and make that Evolution your goal rather than finding happiness through through the externals sometimes more often times you've got more in this difficult situations may be always bigger illusion when things are good when Arjuna spoke that way because they were within this culture that were all of these values and respond
these are so clear Christian Academy Lee speak to him and say what was it, Tasha Cobbs Malone me dumb this you met someone passed them Arjuna where is this this isn't the Arjuna that I know this isn't the way that are Ian and he said that you know of course that that word was
 bastardized co-opted you know but but it means someone that knows the values of life this is in the way that it a person that knows value speaks back to 14 cuz it's all coming out here
 barometer yeah for their six occupation duties
 for the structure of the warrior or a king or a tree is not allowed to Levy taxes and brought his but they may you should not but he may perform the other five of these duties is not allowed to Levy taxes on Brahmin has but he may make his livelihood by levying minimal taxes customs duties and penalty
find upon others as subjects he's the one that put the badge on me I'll protect everyone from the criminals from the Invaders from whatever you do dangerous come to our community I'm willing to die for that I'm going to die for you you know but in order to pull this whole thing together we're going to have to have some taxes they can't be the Brahman is now can say you know what you're texting too much look you're making the people suffer and they're not able to kind of perform their own Duties are or pursue their own spiritual path because your taxes into much so minimal taxes can be you know
 it can be levied custom duties if it's some Traders are coming through your land you're allowed to to you know create some taxes on those and you also allowed Two Fine people you know if you're if you're breaking the degree upon rules of society where and where were expecting another you break them then the fine service is
the way to curb that behavior as well as to fund you know communal interest so that's that's with the King can do but they're not meant to do that to the brahmas cuz the Broncos are just Beggars you can't you can't text and then you know they're exempt already should have given away their never happen again it's what we're talking about some very very high deal here but it is interesting to it's important and interesting feel like study that high ideal and then Steve hey what can what can we bring into our own life it's we're not going to have this Society for the most part in the Mercantile Community that's the Business Leaders now
 Mercantile Community should always follow the directions of the brahmins and engage in such occupational duties such as agricultural agriculture trade and the protection of cows which was the basis of the the economy
okay so let's let's hold right there for second the Mercantile committee should always follow the directions to the brown is what the idea was because of those are the people they're going to help protect your workers because they're they're the ones that I say you see how how detached I am and I'm happy the little Detachment is not going to make your life bad isn't you no care for your workers provide for them pay them salaries enough so that they can be live comfortably and happily that that's those the directions that they have to follow those are the kind of directions are going to get from the brahmas so if you have a miracle towel Community that's not accepting that kind of compassion and wisdom you're going to create hell on Earth

why would you even hate them I feel sorry for them yeah it probably makes it more crispy or maybe she also had experience with compassionate leaders that happier and Ledbetter you know a better quality as well I had compassion both ways because I was those I mean I was deep in my ego for a very long time so you know I made it my spiritual practice to see see myself and others that were acting in ways that I wasn't you know that I thought I didn't want to be that anymore so it really motivated me to work on my own
