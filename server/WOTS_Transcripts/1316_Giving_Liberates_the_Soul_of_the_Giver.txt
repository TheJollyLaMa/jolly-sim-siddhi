reception Ozzy 2 for the reception speed also
 a a bison pay a lot of money to do it from Albany on a horse things happen so quick just remember I remember when I lived in New York everybody has blackberries that was a thing you just had a Blackberry talk you put your hand to your ear and you just talk on your phone no one puts their hand to their ear anymore no one even knows that you can't even make the old sort of heavy metal or Hang Ten Hours act like I'm on the phone that that mujra old world hang up on somebody that's it
old world expression what is your fascination
 horse
 stop when you see a cop by the horse you're like where am I
 like they're going back in time
 it's still riding horses in New York
 I wonder if it's just for like the Nostalgia or picking a good angle to whack somebody in the head with a stick what do you think
 I don't think about it right now answer for this any cops listen to our show
 is it is it
protect OK running please enough
 can I get the hint when I don't talk to you but you shut that down okay today if you knew the shall we start a show with a nugget some type of universal truth spoken by a generally a famous person or someone Anonymous that said something so good that people just copied it spread it around so here's the Nugget this is fun but it's from Maya Angelou who is Maya Angelou she was an author what type of what I believe to do it let's play ryd play ryd
 probably a gardener okay. Mara where is going to tell us but I have found
put that knitting down and speak into the microphone damn you an autobiography three books of essay several books of poetry and is credited with a list of plays movies and television shows band over 50 years 7 autobiographies another autobiography
 okay
 it's what you said here's one of the many things she said cuz you wrote many many books
 I have found that it's
 I have found that among its other benefits giving giving it liberates the soul of The Giver giving liberates the soul of The Giver giving liberates the soul of The Giver giving
okay Rugrats do greed you disagree
 I agree are you kidding that's what it's all about it because giving giving immediately puts you on the side as long as you're giving in good conscious like if you're giving out of resentment or bitterness or at some times for me taking when you get like you were just talking about the urban Davey thing yes yes that kind of gears gears with Mother Teresa said about that is that how much we give but how much you love we put into giving what do you think about that I like that you know why because sometimes people have a dollar a bag on your car glass or something like that in your like oh God get away from me or you can like give with love you can give out of like you annoy me or you can get with love and get you to your kids or give it to end in what's in what's the what's the temperature in Spanish
changes your heart or score could Harden your heart either so yeah but but the idea is that in the in the Bible so you're saying that one second yourself I don't know I so much appreciate what you just said I wanted to spend a little more time with it and inquire from you what do you plan to until you're suggesting that the act of giving
 is nuanced it will not only that it's nuanced but that it grants different results according to your attitude when you do it and that those results have something to do with the hardening or softening of the heart sure it's better than pure selfishness this is 17 chapter bug of agita charity in the mode of goodness ignorance on the right magical chapter 317 chapter today too short and it's good
 but yeah so yeah but the quality of your heart while giving
makes a difference
 so in a sense what you're saying if if I want to take that one step further is that pretty much like all our dealings with other people according to her attitudes are either soft or hard on your heart sure and there before you have different kind of etiquettes or regulations or stipulations or suggestions about how we yogis might live and that they're not just external consideration of other internal considerations exactly lately dishes in the sink drives me in there a little bit crazy they charge you crazy
 well drive me crazy what you doing
 but enough so there's there's a way so I can wash those dishes that are in there but the stupid kids don't they understand we're all living together here
do the same things with resentment or you can do when you know what I'm going to do is love and so it gets you out of the resentful mood which is condemning for the salt work with resentment is condemning for the saw it doesn't mean like we shouldn't try to upgrade things but it sort of works better in the bigger picture when you feel it helps you feel loved and helps others feel loved and is probably better ways to change people then to resent them and shame them you know what I think we just this weekend we had yeah it was just this weekend we had a question about
 it was Eileen's question I think Eileen shoveling about a Hummer see about coming back from pilgrimage and now you're back that she was back in the world of finance and oh yes I'm going to Vegas on a business meeting with a shopping to Vegas like within a week perhaps the first time in history in a question had to do with how can you kind of keep what was kind of Awakening on the pilgrimage so you know how
keep it awake and how do you keep a rising in you when you come back and have to deal with all of the the the devil called dealings of this world and the dealings that team so far removed from that and sounds like in what you're saying right now. There's a clue that like in all that you do
 can kind of be turned into yoga practice that yoga is another kind of keeping an eye on their own awareness and trying to keep it consistent with that of a of a bacta right with out of it or to vote. I'd liked her you know what course are so many classic statement similar to what Maya Angelou same here you know courses the biblical you know it is more blessed to give than to receive your things like that and you know horse you know throughout the ages and so many ways similar statements are made to me her statement was a little bit further like it's one thing to say you're blessed when you're giving us another thing to say that that the act of giving
 liberates the soul
right that's kind of like what you know there's there's there's more in that short statement you know pregnant in that statement right it's it's it's as low as saying that this is the first of all it's saying that the soul is not liberated that the soul is bound how is this whole found you know that giving counteracts it that's a clue to how it's bound right that there's a certain selfishness that binds us for the selfishness is like the core the me first Me First and the Gimme Gimmes that's like the core of materialism the core of the bondage that the core of the bondage that and of course you know you could put that in a household right if it's everybody. Me first you can put that in a in a town and a city
 in a country or Nation to Nation the core up them in this it is the it's the birth
War it's the birth of you giving acrimony no no no cell if you have in the city or in the town of the country or the nation's then you just have it's it's me first and I'm going to get what I want and that's why I big part of our process that you'll get process is you control the senses you tell the census what to do they are your employees you're not be employee of your mind of your senses of your tongue your belly your genitals they work for you you know you we we real them into work for us so that we can that they can assist us to be a they can be our friends are mine should be our friend it shouldn't be our it shouldn't be our worst enemy
 you know it was interesting what you said about taking this idea to the National platform in order
I can if every nation has wholeheartedly embrace the idea that you know will benefit from giving to other nations like that's really where it's at the erratically and if you have a world of Peace but we're kind of oil a little nervous you know like you know I was like well if we give we will will become vulnerable door and it is so we really have to think more about defending or even taking you know
 this is my new car this is why we're going to have to bring it back to the chromatics the soul of the seal is broken can be done because we're all caught in this because in this world we come to this world because of the selfish Gene is that a self-esteem cuz the actually that's not a flight that we have a self-esteem but but but but but we're programmed it's it's selfish
deep deep set programming with my Angela saying is it's counter to that it's a formula that actually you become more sound you become more stable you become more satisfied you become more Blissful through the act of giving you no problem is really upsetting a lot of times when we're reading profiles translations he's the word bhakti is in is in the verse and proper translate sit as
 Social Service social service right which I wanted was sometimes when I read it would have been easier if you would have said back to you right there like that lease to the audience that I'm speaking because it's almost like is there there's a trigger in that phrase devotional service what am I like that. The Busboys hear something like that but yeah
but it's also important that he translated it that way so that we understand that love is an action that that love is as natural Express to action through service right Devotion to show get out there and do something with yourself again back to the Bible at the you know somewhere in there it says in the New Testament faith without works is dead you know it's like I think I think pop out you know cuz earlier you know earlier acharya's like ramanuja charya
 and I've read his bug of agita commentary I can't send I'm very much steeped in his writings like I haven't proposed writing sure but from what I've read in from what I've heard from others
you know his death when he speaks of body and in the end we can translate that we're in different ways but when he speaks of Bucky he's responding to the world that he was in it and in the previous years like Shankar when he speaks of Bucky he speaking about the State of Consciousness called bhakti
 which is a state of its it is a meditative state of of connection to God love for God and when and when prophets peace if he speaks of it he more commonly he speaks on many levels but he more calmly will translate is devotional service and speak of it as an action or I'd like to talk to you as expressed through service
 I think that's you know that's important for us to get pissed because in a sense provides in one sense he's getting to what my Angela saying but in far greater detail you know as he presents brother dietzenbach of time there's a formula
did that we did any saying don't fear I could get in some of these countries is going to show us that maybe one week if we can get to it today don't fear that you will lose through devotional service is actually your nature and don't fear the the recipient of the of your devotional service don't fear that that's that's a tyrant on the other end in one come to probably says that the Emporium person list
 dodo said that deny the personal meditation manifestation of God
 the sharp property uses it turned a shudder to think
 that that at the idea of like Eternal servitude by the shutter to that thought that was banned by the way and they just want Eternal peace no no no you sounds like a good thing right
but there's something beyond that there's something still further the Sunday still there's a higher level of evolution that Eternal service which is a bliss and its own sure well with me and Mary were having this I had to like stop Puja this morning to just share this realization about my volume a lots of me there's a few here so much especially proud lineage of Barry Barry loud statement hunt about a condemnation almost of my body has a more there is no the form of God is just temporary it's just a stepping stone to get to understand that you are God you are God thing is a real relief for people have suffered in abrahamic religions where God is the horrible sadistic Tyrant meant to punish you for every wrong move so it's almost like a really feel like we are God
 we just have to be
we we are Godly we forgot about it so I can go to the dirtiest say that we are actually part of something bigger we're not God and you are God and this is why the boxes really go against it is because you can't love a joke that you out of it kills you out of loving when you want to be when you want to be coming I can give you some type of piece from the material world to understand your spiritual being everybody's a spiritual being but I can really explain this in my life because you know as a singer of abandoned when I was younger I had fans and there were certain fans that wanted to be around you and get your energy of the singer you know there was going to feel your energy you get to hang out you get to go backstage and get to go on tour with them and they had in one sense that it was sort of like friends
according to their intention but they either wanted to just get that thing of hanging out with the band and or they actually what I found was some people have this thing where they actually wanted to be you in the closer they got to you they try to like they became your biggest enemy is like immediately and they add they actually want to become you it's it's a weird thing and this is the thing with my buddy philosophy that is pushed they don't want to serve God they want to be God
 and it's just it's just it's it's mask in a type of spirituality but it's the deepest type of materialism okay stood there said I see a similarity you know there's a lot we can talk about on this
 let's just go ahead and start getting into it let's get it to it cuz we got we got versus to go
I was going to say I don't want you to go off at school cuz you're through the bog that helps and I think I can you get a soldier before signing a human by what time which is a very means of Conquest once you drop respect labason cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Brian Ricci the super most human being mean to other saraswoti the goddess of learning it says she'll be off today of the author not stopped right age for bothering you shoot Nick jump back to your doctor about the ski a regular tennis in classes of the box with Tom and by rendering service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with Transit
what songs will be established as in a revocable fact in a row and spend a little time with their own today
 Mariana to Miranda
 my teachers they've opened my eyes with a torch light of knowledge
 approbation Sees at their Lotus like how did I do good good I sent it all with a little bit more drama meets heart okay answer into the feeling of the heart space or else you're just a parrot we don't want to be parrot like in our recitation of Montreal be happening right here part of you cannot lift like a bird that can actually speak as opposed to a parrot but just mimics okay but like a bird person

and so he says let's listen live a lot up there see if you know what I want to go off on a slightly different like a little
 there's a little interesting squirrel there's nine forms of the shringa
 cuz your joke we're joking about your joking about Uber aganaga he's worshipped like that that's how bad it is in my upper right then there is maloletnice ringa Mama means the goddess Lakshmi refers to the lover this form and a string that has the goddess mahalakshmi depicted in it this is one of the commonest forms Oak Road Hannah string of this form is the Lord to pick extruded teeth the form is also a combination of the third Avatar of Vishnu that sounds like
Paula Chihuahua size is one of the most ferocious forms of the of the Lord he use two hands to tear up and run you catch tapu stomach 222 Garland's on himself with the intestines to hands are used to hold the demon in place and the last to uphold weapons The Conch in The discus
 I think Rob looks wrinkled I think trial of me is like fire, I had a string of the swarm of the Lord of string is called is also called prahlada bardar will shunt on the Stringer this form is often too that means I think he's goddess Lakshmi Baraka Avatar
 if I don't know I don't know the difference but far. I think means he's giving benediction to provide okay bhargava shringa Lord parsram was blessed by Lorna Shore into the form in which he appeared is known as bhargava shringar
this form is similar to Uber in the Stream. OK Google, how do it. As learning string instead the form of Lord is string it has a resemblance of Lord Rama he holds the bow and arrow and has a serpent a none to spread over his head as an umbrella Carranza is a tree which Lord Hanuman perform the Penance and where Lord is showing up here he's a real intimate and string of stuff yo going to shrink a visit interesting one in this around his knees doing Warrior to know he's doing like sending you more like a Lotus position but he's put his knee strap,
 he was using props already had her use props down there if it's formed a hold of meditative pose he has his legs crossed and his eyes closed that is a very
for his hands Rest In Yoga mudra that it didn't know it's piece it is said that it was in this format is Stringer Dave taught his devoted parillaud all the basics of yoga wow I didn't know that you did that locks me to Stringer 4ms Comm depiction of Lourdes ring as I just have so many different ones the Lord has shown with his consort send you a locksmith it is said that during the Avatar Lord a string of goddess Lakshmi took birth as Sinju Lakshmi in the home of some tribals to be with Lourdes tringa their arch-rivals who worshipped as formal or just ring not even to this day travels are people in India that live outside The Vedic culture but for some reason to know that Big River tribal damn it it's confusing it's still there still there today they're mean and I've been living in your generation sociological insights are not test
this is a teachable moment Linda Linda Linda ambulance for her know. That's great you know why someone might ask what what what why do they outline it in this way that like Oaks Unisom Sage or something like that has kind of like saying okay there's all these different ways in which learning shingu is conceived of meditated on served you know in each one because in each form in each manifestation there's a different way that you were late birthday each one is another flavor of devotion another type of meditation
 I'm totes so contagious without line it like that so right now he's more in that fiery
 Kyrie mood right now and it's hard to deal with
I should give it a name special name the exalted proceeded towards learning string Dave and fell down two offers respectful obeisance he's with folded hands
 on the way to string a Dave saw the small by prolonged prostrated at the soles of his feet he became most ecstatic and affection towards his devotee raising prologue the Lord placed his Lotus hand upon the boy's head because his hand is always ready to create fearlessness in all of his devotees
 okay so he's got a human feet in case you were wondering but he's got
by the touch of learning sugar names of the Paw Paw Hands-On provide head or touch of cats paws the sweetest thing ever pads then they got that little bit him like a button and the switchblade as if he had been thoroughly cleanse interesting you think this is a great sages do they but they placed her hand on your forehead on your third eye and just like to Happy on the head right us one would do that to my children when they were little but this hand on their head or tap them on their head like almost like this shaktipat or declare their third eye or something mystical but it seems to provide so we're in this was already on such a pure level
 must be talking to the next level I guess I wondered is it and can you get to a pureed ability or can you get the soup
where can you get a platinum pure what is it something within their awareness of prolonged Marge was taken to the next level the lab is completely free of all material contaminations and desires therefore he had once became Transit that's what happens or touches your forehead and symptoms of ecstasy like
 his heart filled with love in his eyes with tears and. She was able to completely capture the Lotus feet of the Lord within the core of his heart beautiful
 provide fixed his mind and sight on Lord to string a Dave with full attention and complete trance with his mind fixed to begin to offer prayers in love with faltering voice right the faltering voice is a humble voice
read this next verse in a faltering voice for me who have been born in a family of a sewer is Dean and that's altering it that's like to offer suitable prayers satisfy the Supreme personality of God and all the saintly persons cannot satisfy the Lord streams of excellent words although such persons are pre-qualified being in the mud of goodness and what is it to be set up for me
 if not at all qualified rubbing I just imagine what would have been like if you were one of the bird people are you are one of the other people that I just offered prayers but they weren't with tears in the eyes right this level of devotion right this is what Bobby time is putting the frame around for us years years what years did the Consciousness that were aiming for sure
play some giving charity a beggar coming to the streets in here and get some money stuff back into my window or person saying here's some more that how are you today I'm just saying there's a Nuance versions of prayers there's new versions of I'm just trying to bring it back to work nuggets ER in West Bend displayed here is that the higher higher higher levels of Bucky is body is trembling tears in his eyes he's feeling love is not just talkin about love of God and he's feeling it so deeply
 let the tears are coming from the eyes and he's just speaking with such humility and love okay okay next one
 text 918 possess wealth and aristocratic family Beauty austerity education sensor
expertise luster influence physical strength diligence intelligence and even Mystic yoga power but I think that even all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the Supreme personality of godhead however one can satisfy the Lord simply by devotional service devotional service gajendra did this unless the Lord was satisfied with him while you were in something that even happen longer ago like an elephant and a saintly King born into the body of an elephant famous story became a big mass of alpha elephant and then he got attacked by a crocodile
 and now it's like one of these it's one of these nature is metal seeing for the alligator bringing the crocodile and the crocodile versus
elephant and the Elephant sort of like in the water and all the other elephants are like oh let's get out of here are our King is getting killed and all the all the debate of elephant start to run and he's desperate he's got no no one's there he was on the top of the world and now he's liking this humiliating situation where you have to get killed and that you know what there's alligators to do they do the death tour illiteracy that they grabbed the victim they do that with him eventually they would probably the one with that elephant body around or something if it gets beaten up water and and it wouldn't you know it wasn't the only way to make a long story short when everything becomes destitute in our life and we have nowhere to turn
 that's when Krishna loves you and Krishna likes you start to give you what you want when Krishna likes you he makes you the king of the elephants I'm Krishna loves you he starts to strip everything away so there is nothing left except Krishna Krishna
is exactly what the gender did he picked a Lotus that was growing in that lake river and he goes reach it up to the sky drunk it with his trunk with his arm like trunk or a ninja star is offering prayers to Lord Vishnu Vishnu appeared
 you know so so it's there's a reason why God judges mentioned I mean he could have picked anyone right tell many I had everything he was like all the elephants she was the Super Alpha of the Jungle he was a super Alpha I think it's almost the opposite of that right what is that it said he was an elephant
 write like it in other words because it's saying someone may have and you know he's in front I think this is really important he's saying that in front of all of these different Davis and he's different Universal high-level character that we just heard about in the last chapter because they have wealth tremendous wealth sure they have aristocracy
they're coming from Super high-level families but I'm the son of go to Mauricio way high-level family is so sorry I mentioned this or you just speculating they charge to mention this right okay I'm not sure on this verse I didn't read this first but I've heard these things mentioned before that they have incredible beauty
 they having the potential to perform a credible austerities they're very educated they have sensory expertise exaggerated set all all the things that you listed we think these make us can these make a special in the eyes of God in the eyes of People magazine those are very very special qualities you know why the take logically take that to the next that wire they nothing in the eyes of God make me cuz different ways you can answer it meant to serve God they are meant for you to be God
this is why and because we're not God yet people are telling us we got the validation of the people are telling us were so important it's trash crazy looking Janis Joplin's Jimi Hendrix you get so much babe and you don't know how to what to do with it every Davis jr. that energy of Fame that energy of something is very beautiful people are crazy sometimes people are sometimes you were very wealthy people are unsure who loves up that energy you have a shock to you have right it has to be reunited with the Lord and that's a grounding principle of Shakti it right that the feminine the masculine if you have some great quality you have to offer that back to the Lord and that will ground that quality get back to my Angela right there right now I was thinking two answers to that question that I proposed to remember
question
 what question who are you you know these all these different qualities that are being mentioned by gajendra high-level high-level birth Beauty austerity wealth education and all these think they can't touch the heart of God why
 come over here right now why can't they touch the heart of that one answer could be
 that these are God's owns energies himself
 you know in other words
 I didn't create my beauty I didn't crave my well those are given to me those are those are the energies of of God so when I'm like here take my wealth you know here's a donation take my well it's kind of like that's his already
anyway you know just like a child will give sometimes you know the parents of the child some money and the child was using to buy a present for the parents
 it's not the and usually some insignificant little gift right yeah and the parent paid for themselves so it's like what do they gain they didn't really gain anything but if it's done with the law. And that present means more than anything so it's none of these things are was going to touch the heart of Krishna revision you got beautiful but you're growing beautiful flowers and then you offer to the Lord big deal Krishna made those for how many the flower in the ground like I made this Garden you to make anything exactly exactly so so so that's one and then the other thing is just the nature of Krishna that these are speaking to the nature Christian that he's not he's not like the people of this world that can be bought with metier
things are that is in that are impressed with material opulence Mathira opulence means nothing to him his interest is in love and so the gender is being mentioned because he's not high-level birth he got born an elephant family you know well well he's got a elephant well for you and he's an elephant for crying out loud if they have devotion will touch the heart of God where is
 you know the most of the highest person in the universe you know even if they have wealth and beauty and all these things that doesn't that doesn't move Krishna and this is important we understand the heart of that is a great point and I think actually now that I think about it dog sore much more spiritual and cats because dogs are devoted
 they do seem
have a more devotional attitude want to lay on your chest and they want to do what they want to do it or take hers but Acres dogs are give ourselves a dogs what are they want they want your love it when your tension I want is your happy the greatest think nothing could have stopped by but they always were there just like I hate humans but I love my dog now ya did the less complicated
 yeah then he that humans I think we're done for today but we'll get to the connection we did before the show today for everyone I said rug and we need to get two verse 11 we need to move quick I know it's a different version
it was very sad but at that point I said okay scrap that plan
 are there any takeaways today you got some more stuff you want to by Charles Dickens check this one out no one is a thing to do with what we talked about giving no one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another we find our significance in giving thank you for sharing your dickensian wisdom Never Gonna
 the intention and giving can soften or Harden your heart into a meme can either hard or soft or hard
condemned by resentment
 selfishness is the core of our bondage 2024
 the stupa
 a picture of you like holding your beard
 field of ocean get out there and do something with it
 eternal love is higher than Eternal peace we're aiming for Consciousness like prologue
 maybe even higher than one sense cuz I just hired a lot of cuz we aim for the you should just be like I want to serve her a lot when will be higher than totally but we do aim for the delay of the residents are not even throw that in there now okay sorry
talk to you with the Lord to ground it just shocked me with the Lord to bring me another
 all our material opulence has won't touch the heart of God
 it's good generous devotion not his elephant wealth cats are takers dogs are givers yes they are all they had stickers to some of them they give you a dead bird bring back a dead animal and they offer like here I did this for you yes I did notice cuz I'm up earlier I go out I'd say there's a decapitated beast on my doormat
