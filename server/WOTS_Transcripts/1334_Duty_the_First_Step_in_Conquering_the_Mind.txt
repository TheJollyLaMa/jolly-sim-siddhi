ask me about the show and play the hands tied Festival yesterday can I hide a little tight down control I got I got run over by a human pickup truck yesterday on stage like a bowl I went out to sing to the people that just ran and clocked me in the head with his body I don't even think he realized he did it but it sounded like I got a chiropractic adjustment my home at 1
 and I was like like birds are flying around my head like I was like that in a daze is just at the first song and I was like the things we do to preach I was so I was like I'm either going to be dead tomorrow morning or I'm going to feel like my impression of my neck has been lifted and I'm a new man but it was a
 there was a big beautiful show.
meet up with the cruise tons of others out there and in the hands of others to devotees tons of is almost like their religion
 and to play a show it's like it gives them faith in their religion somehow and there are you are the message I got a message of clean living that's the religion but it is cute and they're so Krishna friendly to you know I'm at 8 on Monday the words have changed my life completely stopped eating meat and clean my whole life or you know there was one girl in a Punjabi outfit in the pit
 Punjabi outfit in the pit crying saying you saved my life cultural crossover went well when you speak
they said you saved my life and like yes my little one it's not me and truth of God one truth into spiritual truth and there's a commonality and all these truths and yeah I'm part of it is self-control control your mind curb your passions that universal truth
 universal truth about Universal nugget
 right after the show I'm taking off so I can't even say my good-byes I got to jump on that
come here is our nugget for the day sir
 put it with the rest of the notes I sent you that message you just Channel it listen my son getting distracted by is that a set of Epictetus a bigger than potatoes
 I assumed he was
 Greek Roman
 I'm assuming he was a stoic right sounds do to me
 okay getting sounding nugget yes getting distracted by Trifles
 is the easy
staying in the world's focus on your main duty Lord Krishna
 maybe they did in their own way once once some
 our friends sham Sunder approval he was working on a book with Sheila Powell pod that eventually became called dialectical spiritualism what's a good book and so Prince
 I doubt it I think there was some criticism because
 the idea was he would come to show a profit every day and explain a different philosopher like a western philosopher and then probably would comment on that philosopher in light of bug of agita and Baba tamatoa but I think there was some criticism that may sometimes maybe the Philosopher's weren't perfectly represented
how you do the best you can you do the best you can but I think it's it was very cool if you're interested in Western philosophy
 whoever picked 80's heavy Titus and then I said well what did he actually believe what he believed a b c and d okay here's what this is yours were happy about this is it's a nice way to understand the bridge between the different cultures and and so and I believe it was in the context of those conversations it may have been a sham Sunder that ass prop hunt
 maybe someone else but ask him essentially ask him some like are you telling me that these philosophers and none of them had God consciousness
 and probably said something interesting
 you tell me I can't remember what it was he said their sincerity is their God consciousness
Timmy says I can other words we're generally trying to block the truth and block out of him and I think he kind of atheistic scientists we talked about a lot that's really just like a an advanced way of doing that but if you just sincerely want to know truth and what sense that is God Consciousness right it's like you you've opened yourself up to understanding what it's true you're you're you're moving forward you're you're moving towards truth just threw some genuine sincerity
 this is about Duty we're going to have time yeah how does Judy play a role in your life
 are you kidding you to find yourself easily distracted by Trifles
 oh yeah okay and that does duty help you duty duty sort of like drags you back on track it has to be especially if you don't work for somebody if you're self-employed you have to really be focused on
on your mission and I've been very mission-oriented my entire life well I mean has the channel of the Divine love
 but yeah I want to get distracted you know I think Western mind we kind of like we're not so into the concept of Duty I mean we want everyone else to be dutiful the cop to be very dutiful the politician to be very beautiful the teacher to be very dutiful as if you're on the train to the subway because we don't want anyone putting any rules or regulations on our life we don't want any expectations we want to be free but you know that that that can lead down some some messy roads where it's like in The Vedic yoga
Paradigm it was like really chiseled into that you were supposed to do today there was no like there was no to do list is like you know what to do whether you know what according to your occupation you know what to do and according to your stage in life you know what to do you know if I find a concept that actually
 too much Choice can make a person miserable God it's so true it's right it's like I don't know like if I'm in a hotel and there's like a like a remote control for like a television I practically don't expect a billion channels I can't watch that it's just so confusing I'm like I like when there was four channels I'm so damn old it's ridiculous
the garbage please like a local garbage or the national garbage garbage to guess who says he needs his daughter to help him and she's only seven like we do the same thing where we like and can you help us turn on the television but but having that Duty you know it actually makes the my more peaceful and it's and I say it's it's the first step in in conquering to mine is the first step in yoga cuz the mind is saying Run free you know eat drink and be merry don't let anyone tell you what to do and then Duty comes on says actually gained control actually that's not Freedom you're just being dragged by your senses in your mind here in their duty means do the right thing be dharmik bring about you know what you need to do is a father. You know what you need to do right
yeah we need to know what we need to do as a spouse as a parent as a child to a parent you do as a student as a teacher in our occupation it should be clear, but the attics are right what's the ZIP code that I'm confused you're confused people are confused. Do in their duties
 Epictetus had another one similar to this he said he'd not diverted from your duty that sounds like going to keep the right there right when you do 20 Jan Arden not diverted from your duty by any idle Reflections the silly world may make upon you
 oh silly world for their sensors are not in your power and should not be at all your concerns right like I got my job to do in life right today I'm going to it's it's merch where your merch Monday
I don't care you know I have my duty as a as a violation of I have my duty is about to Yogi I have my duty again as a parent at my end and I just saw that and it keeps me moving on the right path you know it's it's the beginning of spirit is the beginning of yoga that's right because Judy means you just connect whimsically and a big reason why we suffer in this world is my mind is Whimsical it was it's all over the place and I need to control my mind so it's like the foundational principle of of meditation you have to be happy by doing Duty you can no longer mine on Hulu to the left and move to the right you have to stay on track
 it and then you know there's this idea that you know the dude is all it has its purpose that anyone of us if someone came up civil what are your duties in life we should be able to boom boom boom boom boom and I know it is not like we can sit there
and figure it out in the household to figure it out in a household figure it out who's responsible definitely dude is like who washes the dishes and who does it that's got to be there but even I think even to take it up to on a little bit of deeper ethical level what is my duty to you as your parent what is your duty to me you're not as my child what is my duty to you as a husband what did you do to me as a wife if we should know these things it's a way of clearing up expectations and it's a way of creating some healthy guardrails in life and then when someone operating outside the duty, everybody knows him they can see do you see each other problems start as soon as we unload the dishwasher now all hell is breaking loose I looked up when you said that right there are so beautiful it's ridiculous I call her Duty day be
yogurt culture it was clear it should be clear to us the purpose of the duty how it you know in in the whole beta conception Seafood is really clear and they were kind of property sometimes you call them prescribed duties because different people with different psychology's in different stages of Life have duties prescribed specifically for their mindset you know I will share this a lot but you know like said your person is really good at making money and you got to drive in the aptitude
 they never understands the category person you're the guy that starts a business in employees everyone we got it that's great go out and you know be prosperous and employ people and it's great for the economy is great for it but understand that don't just people lie and just trying to make money you don't like another's if it in the west that person may think like in our current age write the person who has that aptitude somewhat rare
person right it's not it's not everybody that's got that
 start your own business become successful expands and creates that we know some people like that ride like you that they always have another business now really don't like I told you what I was doing this stuff so that person with that aptitude it in our life they may think let me just my success is measured by how much money I make how much more making there are there's not enough understand your duties and just to blindly make money your duty is to take care of your your employees that's your duty if your duties if if you're profiting and your employees are suffering haven't carried out your duty you haven't understood it and end so you're cultivating greed and you're generating Bad Karma for yourself and suffering for others
 you haven't filed your duty is to see that all of your employees have
their basic necessities mad you know that they can live a life that's that song where they can have a mind peaceful enough to pursue their spiritual goals that's your duty you don't answer your duty to give me charity cuz you're the one making all the money is it's your duty to look out for others and if you follow those duties then your negative put your potential for your app for your skills to drag you down into greed it'll be counter through the duty and and it'll end and it'll kind of keep you progressing spiritually pure devotees the super elevated Yogi's they actually don't need any duties cuz it kind of already achieved the goal and that's going to be discussed today I've been in
 and then by the time
 again I pick Titus
 your item
is what I got a fever and shaking
 Ryan and the musketeer and that I'm saving it until Monday before I sign the stream about what time was never mean to Conquest when should I be respectful of base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan Russia Today of the author not stop here CVS I'll give it to you too much locate back to you in about 39 sticky a regular tennis in class in the bag with time and they ran research that your devotees

 I was born at
perseverance my teachers are opening my eyes with a tort side of knowledge half round Bay since he's at their Lotus feet right there
 they really come to see my baggage
 send text 23 who's speaking now
 the poor has come out right now as I'm traveling for this is garnet ring they speak in the Pearl and made it out of bed this morning and Company but you would have known you were a kid you would have taken that bump like it's nothing very very refined stage diaper and Dancer
 okay
 in other words this other person
now there's a big animals coming up hook up me around their necks throwing me around they've got like that teenage superhuman strength even have an old man for crying out loud I know the best calls you say hi. I did that in diet like this is so that the half man half lion Avatar of Lord Vishnu you're seeing my day is now speaking to provide us are from benedictions and he's he's giving them instructions for how to live in the future now he told him you know what you you're so selfish with that when I asked you to take a benediction you just said will that help my father who was torturing you and trying to kill you look your character he says don't worry about
father just because I love you so much you're your whole dynasties been blessed but but now he's going to say now this is how you live your life moving forward little five-year-old provide you're going to become king now
 what if you became king at 5 I think that's why I said right now
 okay here you go after performing the ritualistic ceremonies take charge of your father's Kingdom sit upon the throne and do not be disturbed by materialistic activities please keep in mind or please keep your mind fixed upon me without transgressing the injunctions of The Vedas as a matter of formality you may perform your particular duties and he's like duties of kings and it's not just invade a culture you'll see these Indie like European Kings that have this there's like the disrespect and his love for Kings if you go to different countries that they still have a king
I have a king in name only in the king had this very similar dermis I'm wondering if all you been to countries where there's a I mean I guess England and stuff but what about money poor was like the wizard King there when you are there
 do you know I don't know I didn't mean that there was before they were all kingdoms all Rodger Stone was broken up into different kingdoms but but I'm talking about like in a Thailand has a king and you see the pictures everywhere but it's a man in Europe to and there's this there's this
 sentimental there's something in the heart that just sentimentality but what cemetery doesn't that tell you negative thing that you're feeling that like we want to we want someone that's some benevolent us protect others
anyway it's interesting to find out why did these come from beta kings were all the rituals the bathing rat United Bay the tale I can wash the feet of the king the coronation to the coronation The Sword and I'll let you know so here he says something interesting he says I'm so saying first of all the first interesting thing is he saying don't just be a Yogi Bear cuz it's it seems like
 why didn't you know his father was as big material is King why should he do that why get entangled in that kind of thing I want you to be king I want you to perform the ritual Ceremonies for your father's funeral
 and then I want you to take charge so even that's Duty right
 the different to do the type of form the different rights at the time of the death of the father and then he said sit on the throne and don't be disturbed by materialistic
will be in the world but not of it that you can do that and he said you can do it by keeping your mind fixed on me
 and it and then he says this lesson without transgression the injunction to The Vedas like live according to The Vedic
 I duties
 as a matter of formality because you don't actually need them for the reference performative kind of
 in order to be reformed yourself you already reformed
 that's the purpose of the duties right so the problem isn't culture is like we don't even have a we don't even have an idea of like this is supposed to lead us somewhere yeah I'm going to start a business I'm going to be an athlete I'm going to be a gardener I'm going to be going to be a musician at then I hope it becomes successful like that is the idea there enjoy the results of God are yea and pearl has already there
 so
so it's so he doesn't need the duties to kind of keep them in let you know of course there's a verse from the public piranhas really important verse
 you know in Oscoda didn't cheat on a charge from Rita smart of you said the tongue Beach North Beach Bar at them know that your attitude sorry leave it in the shade of shore 80 or if it can Kora Kora means it means and so testy smart the rest of the time Dishner
 dishwasher to know the job. There's two kind of big rules in life always remember Krishna
 never forget him I like that's like that's the main thing right and and and then serve avd all the different rules all the different regulation all the different duties all the different rituals and rites all that stuff
sorry didn't say this or are they should all be seen as Servants of this primary rule to always remember God is leading us somewhere that's called yoga right to bring your awareness to one focal point and it all the suitors I meant to bring us there that the Met Her Sisters sure if they're not assisting Us in getting there that you're missing the whole point in doing the duty if you're already there there's really no necessity for you to perform the duty but
 generally the debauchee Yogi's perform the duties still as a matter of formality to set the right example for others you know I think that this is why it's important for households have a little altar in their house and see their home is not as their home but this is krishna's home this is Christmas space and that way even things that appear like Monday in like I'm going to watch this I'm going to sweep the floor I'm going to keep it clean
your Consciousness becomes this is Christmas home this is krishna's Temple and I'll agree that you really understand like that none of our work becomes just
 killing time or just working for the temporary all of your efforts being Dino disintegrating by the force of time but you're actually cultivating something Eternal something that seems so Monday and sweeping a floor dusting is actually becoming part of your conversation is krishna's house to do a lot of Dusty Dusty stupid ghosts a little bit more in the commentary
once you start the counter read up to a proper crochetverse
 what do I becomes a devotee he no longer has any duty to The Vedic regular principles one has many duties to perform but if one becomes fully devoted to the Lord he can no longer he no longer has any such obligations and obligations is a famous verse in the Bible what time do they start selling them 7 yum when was fully surrender to the Lotus feet of the Lord is no longer a debtor to his forefathers the great sages Human Society the Common Man or any living entity we have a lot of debts to pay tell her I sent you her parents whether we like them or not our parents have done so much for us and then if there's a debts they say that the forefathers we don't even give them any credit we do
my great-grandfather any credit but we have debts to our forefathers lived that we have great debts to
 previous Masters previous teachers I mean we're sitting here in the middle of nowhere New York City Detroit and it's like it's like somehow Transit until truth is trickle down and landed on my lap and we're just like wow spiritual information we're in debt to that we have a debt it's very foreign to the American state of mind yeah we're entitled and you know it's it's not it doesn't even have to eat the word dead or I think I think we
 we associate the word dad with like anxiety we have a resistance to this concept because of that
think of it more as a gratitude right like we should be feeling and expressing gratitude for all that we received if you cultivate that attitude it's it's it's favorable like it's nurturing the right character in the right disposition that's conducive for maintaining family and Society like on the external level but also conducive for developing the right devotional heart you know her and so supplies got that but you know you can't you can see he immediately thought of his forefathers when he was offered a benediction he didn't think of himself he thought of all I am indebted to others that me let me look after them if everyone's thinking like this
 the world to speak the material will become the spiritual world so so it's it's ingrained into Indian Society maybe not always maybe not always in the most healthy way maybe it is a little guilt
you know you got some guilt aspect to it or something like that hey you know you're indebted to me I'm your father you better do this you had to do that you know and what about your grandfather what are going to be you know you know you know what there's a it's always a fine line I guess between like social pressure being you know a nurturing thing or it being a destructive kind of element I know that you know what they say and in the chowpatty temple in Mumbai ride open at Temple would you know they're there is a promise you you know that long long long time from a tree there goes way back you know govind approval
 Suite of old e-learning devotee one of these really special Souls there right
 those were my 90's my part I know it's a lot of stuff in it and it just has great storytelling and he especially
 he specially was like kind of and it's
channel guide for a lot of the children in the community you know and you know they would come to the temple and he would rather gather around him and he would kind of like what you're picturing yourself being when when you start this Super Soul summer camp summer camps how you got all the kids around you down somehow borrow it and and the parents they would say like you know if their kid was misbehaving and anyway
 and the parents are you say well you know what what was Covina probably going to say when he hears about this 60 healthy thing that you have people in your life that that just by the power of their own character in Purity and just out of your own indebtedness to them you feel
 this gratitude in this appreciation and it even a little shame if necessary right to 22 kind of reform
when I was growing up there was no like older kids to look up to the older kids we just beat the hell out of here for you it was not like your siblings fact they like that for you but you didn't but it was like strong inspiration
 I know not like that not like that when I was little I was with me and my younger brother a little of a big family so we were treated like the little children and actually let my brother my brother like I'm going to buy you a bicycle you need a bicycle bought me and my first bicycle things you're not affectionate affectionate affectionate it's a dude
seniors to be affectionate and kind to Junior City and it's a duty of Juniors to be respectful to seniors that I know the problem is I just got all this it's like what is it in the in the breed of Americans who just won
 no respect and respect her so you know this first day of our she pooped in the renowned Pick 3 number that if you fold Lee surrendered
 to God if you giving your life holy
 then you no longer debtor and end of the point of this is that you know if you read The Vedas is ancient text that explain all this Rich they explain all the different gods and goddesses right there's a god of the sun Soria is it out of the Moon Chandra is about of the rain injury does the goddess of dawn who's the Goddess of dawn
 sabbatical
my name is left on my mind right now on the goddess of the Dawn cuz you know there's there's there's gods and goddesses for even like aspects of life like knowledge or learning starts w e
 you know where each of the Goddess watch
 you know that run and yeah I did end end you know friendship
 the garbage friendship is a prominent idea that we are indebted to all these gods and goddesses that they pretend not only personify but they're kind of the superintendents of all these gifts of nature
 and therefore your daddy to each one of them and it also if you want to continue to receive these blessings then you need to do the flea live according to their standards in and dutifully offer some something back
form of ritual you know that the is a formal way of saying thank you I appreciate it you know and I'm I'm ready for more if your goddess Lakshmi over here and it needs to be when it comes to the high or teachings of The Vedic Literature Like The Bog will you find us first
 it's saying that if you giving your all of those gods and goddesses are working on behalf of the Supreme the root of all existence and if you water the route you watered all of them if you satisfy the route you satisfied all of them if you given your life there for if you fully surrender your life to the root of all existence
 to God then you're no longer dead or to the gods to the goddesses to the forefathers to to the great sages you satisfy them all
 by your connection to the roof I've been a bali a few times
and in Bali you just they're all there's bison I was in Bali as well now but there is a lot of time I got a lot of people worshipping demigods and even demons to Vedic viticulture still operating still operating there and you'll just see them you'll be like in a shop buying something in there doing a Puja and worshipping different demigods or sometimes they'll do meet the offer meet to where the demons and then so the demon will give them some protection or not harm them and then they throw it out in the street now to appease the DD to appease the deity do all these but there's an idea consciousness of stuff I've got is not just random that coming from know where there's several entities like that are working working it and I have to sort of appreciate that there's protection out there their safety there's money coming in there's good fortune and people from an atheistic point of view things well these guys are just it's superstitious
we on the other side so I will actually all of it comes from Krishna just Crush just trust Krishna Christians got a greater plan even your business isn't doing well there's a greater plan for that because God is benevolent and therefore we're all moving up wherever we are just worship Krishna similar to a stranger to God just ran it to my messenger logo
 yeah you know and I think even that there is obviously there's some remnant of this like like you really seems like I think just recently I read that this one kind of famous Old School pizza place in New York was stuck out in Brooklyn of shutting down you know the one under the Brooklyn Bridge out there the one way out there and and and you know it gets handed down like from it
the generations in the family that pizza place you could just sip look succession of succession in the kids just came across a Spumoni Gardens I think it was Spumoni Gardens and I'm not sure about that so don't tell Hunter I don't want to cause anyone any shock here but but you know what yeah but there's that idea that's in cents of a sense of indebtedness to carry on what we offered to society and therefore like the children like if you're born in a Brahmin family
 it's your kind of will you don't know how far back and in your family goes that like my group my grandfather great grandpa great great great great great great great for they were handing down these mantras they're handing down these rituals are handing down this these codes of Ethics from generation to generation because it's good for society and that's what our family does is what we offer to society in in the doctors went to
wisdom what are you going to do now with your life I'm going to I'm going to be a DJ DJ DJ it's a new generation but set so so therefore like ignoring one's duties is in The Vedic Paradigm is like all your you've really blown it but if you're giving your life entirely 222 Vishnu or in Tyler to Christian that all no no no this is this is the best but still a lot of Pilates carrying out the duties that his father had at of like kind of ruling the kingdom but but he's ordered by by Vishnu really depressing as you're saying you don't have that book me in marriage like
 nine lives by William Daria limbo new talks about all these very interesting stories about
people he meets in India and one was of a deity maker they talk about what it takes to make a deity and it comes from the other day of lines of a way to do it is a time of day to do it and very very interesting stuff and then they asked about his son what's your son doing is my son's into Tech and Tack and computers and I don't think he's going to take the business on that will say for all that the depressant we're all the sadness you can get like man is it all going to end I tell you there's so many people from the Western World from from format for formal former Soviet Union that are just like know they're taking this wedding culture really well and they're like oh yeah resurrecting the things that are dying out language ritual dance music they're like taking a medicine to take him to hold astrology and take it to a whole new level
it's not going to go away and bigger it is that is that something is that just a speculation that some of your channels from the Easter I took it from the sky nice very nice oh you see what happened the pizza place is closing because I think I want to watch murdered I wonder if it was like I hit like a pizza Mafia hit I hope not
 what's going on with New York stupid back to the 80s now you're just doing a real so yeah that's not more than it was back when I was a kid that's for sure
 I feel safe on the streets I don't get all worked up like that's right could you tell me could all work.
yeah
 Debbie text 24
 whenever you're ready whenever you just read that text your dad when he continued thus as the Supreme personality of God had ordered a lot Mirage perform the ritualistic Ceremonies for his father okay this year he was then in throne in the Kingdom of her any cashew Pooh as directed by the brahmins so that's duty to write I even though I'm the rule and I got all this power
 I know that they're these wise simple living
 people write their their minds are deeply absorbed in in and knowledge there their character is very reformed their needs are very simple that they're not confusing attached by the things that most people and therefore they can speak wisdom and so even though I got the political power allow myself to be guided directed by these deeper thinkers

 liver Mass surrounded by the other demigods was bright paste because the Lord was pleased with us he offered prayers to the Lord with Transit into words you know there's something right there in that verse are you picking anything up
 rubber mallet bright face yeah I mean really the whole the person that was really Shining
 was perlot I he was
 he was just kind of been recognized as like particularly favored by Lord Vishnu he's kind of the hero of the day remarkably like all that he's stealing my thunder station. I'm usually the big number one you know maybe this news number one but but I'm kind of seeing is the next one in the chain right now the closest to him for largest kind of has been kind of exposed in front of all of everyone that's always
