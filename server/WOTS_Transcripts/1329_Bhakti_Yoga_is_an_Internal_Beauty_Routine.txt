 welcome everybody cuz dealer you made it back okay I made it back I brought a couple living entities back with me by the way perhaps a tadpole no two ticks grass or hours you going to be a tech check I didn't wake her up at 6
text Sarah I found them I located them I pluck them and release them back into nature well
 alright anyone else is mere oh yeah we have back to your cover get meetings today the men meet at noon and the women meet at 2 p.m. to go to another today or you don't have it there we have it a l l e l e is not in the face
 beauty is a light in the heart is not in the face beauty is a light in the heart
we tend to think right or beauty or even are worth comes from
 my abdomen interesting turn the bass down to the but the leg we have nice legs we think we have to find a way to be a nice eyes we think we've found our worth it beautiful hair we don't
 matter of fact
 then I will get into it deeply philosophical I'm going to pass on it but I'm going to say that are worth comes from our contributions in this world and our contribution creates our Beauty
 and what we're giving back to this world otherwise this the other things are just their subjective time
 end
 they're subject to time there's some external beauty could Ark on your ear and also be subject
know well not if it well
 if it is connected to Divinity that contribution is eternal and will last you through this body through this time so yeah our contribution can be and it still makes you beautiful even if it's temporary it has some beauty there
 it worked because because what it is is it's giving back to something greater than ourselves and sacrifice will give some type of more lasting Beauty than temporary Beauty but when we do it in connection with the eternal
 then that's lasting Merit even in her next life you bring that with you cuz you do course in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says hanging Arjuna your duty is just to make your contribution and whether you succeed or fail doesn't matter
 should I great that's almost like that that statement could ruin all sports isn't it
Vince Lombardi guys just go out there and try your hardest to get paid a lot of money to win a title fight for the boxer and a certain Ashley said Carrie depressing but but in any case that seems to indicate that you're saying the contribution but I suppose you mean not exactly the external of the contribution but like the heart rate did that the intention that invested in the contribution the Consciousness the selflessness that's the beauty that's the view that's the light in the heart you know it's like course when we say hi we
 we generally speaking about the end of the center of our emotions right this this is deep inner Consciousness that we have
when someone is kind of
 when they lack feeling when their callous mother not consider it then we say they're heartless and if someone's really kind and good-natured
 the care about others then we say they have a heart of gold and you know I was thinking when you where you started it's like you the face right like
 light eyes when we think of you do we think about the face beautiful face yeah and then people have a lady's particular they have Beauty routines right
 they'd actually do they actually everything they do everyday and your beauty routine Mara Mara Justine wash my face
moisturizer that show you have a special moisturizer I have no Beauty routine I think that's why I look the way I do
 so I started in your bathroom rug and not something called the patanjali call face scrub or something like that men's face wash for the kids cuz it smells good you're not you're not using your open and I bring a lot back I saw that you bought into the yogic marketing their you want for the patanjali brand
 yeah I said it must be good I think there was some Scandal of using some less than worthy ingredients
the point is that we find her beauty from the external and use that as our currency
 a currency goes down by like the market crashes the market crashes are we spend a whole life using that currency a beauty just to manipulate right so what there's to do what you want get your hooks in a guy or a woman okay ladies we know why you're doing the beauty routine well it's just because it would create a culture and maybe we haven't created at maybe that's what culture is but that are worth is on our Beauty and an end as devotees were we should we should see maybe we don't see cuz it's it may be ingrained in our DNA but we should see that that that that worth and that light comes from a sacrifice greater than ourselves and we see that when actually when we do see that people are
finger heart or something bigger than themselves it's attractive at truth truth is sometimes even you see it in politics it's maybe a temporary maybe political cause but the people are so worked up about it with a while he's person's a martyr for their cause but when he's actually connected to Spirit becomes very very beautiful and often times if you're doing it in the right way there's no hate in the heart and then it becomes very attractive yeah but we can see that even someone within the political world we we CNN they're all these
 Talking Heads Are you do representatives of different to spokespersons sometimes we see even in the the name of your they're they're speaking as if they're speaking for the good of the people caring for the people wanting the best for the people but they can do it with with such Venom
 and it makes you wonder where's the hard really at you know
and you know so like a lady may have a beauty routine
 I guess men think it comes from their body or they got their gym routine maybe more so than the face or something like that right but in any case I could look at it and just think about it like a lady has a beauty routine like they do things like they have his mask that they put on their feet like they spread that stuff on their face mask peel
 you Maya do masks how long do they clean that stuff on for
 15 minutes or so
 okay leave it on before they go to bed they were they have this makeup removal routine and then they rub something else on and they do things than they brush their hair 100 Strokes I'm Aaron. What they do
 used to be like a standard
but I'll let you know but but they will you would take it seriously like I'm going to be dedicated to this day lyrics Beauty routine right because my beauty is there in my face I want to make sure I'm willing to put in the effort to maintain the beauty here Kahlil Gibran diseno the Buick is this light in the heart and in what sense that's all we could look at you don't invite to yoga right bhakti yoga in particular because you do other Yogi's they're the primary motivation maybe I want to be I want to become free of suffering right that's why I do the yoga that's why do it again and that's why I renounce the things of this world that's why I walk away because I'm suffering
 I'm suffering due to my ignorance knowledge you know truth counteracts that then I'll become free of suffering the body is it's a little bit different right the primary concern is the quality of my heart
 weather
suffer I don't suffer that's really none of my business sometimes we see the people with the pure you know lit hard or the ones that are willing to suffer you know because they're so they're they're so good-hearted they're so pure heart because they have a heart of gold a hard to dispute that we say gold I think the value of you know part of the value can go that has a beauty to it but it's also it doesn't like a what's the term I like a a metal becomes like
 like when you have silver quickly
 thought you don't have to polish it again because what's the word you know what I can to get purified you know who likes melting right they put it to get the gold ore and you you put under this intense Heat
 and it's you know I suppose our life can be kind of seems like this is the
we could conceive of if we want to be beautiful you know that this is the true beauty to develop This Heart of Gold to develop this Pure Heart to tolerate whatever heat is involved in and getting us there and realizing that
 the reframing the difficulties the challenges the struggles that the pain that we endure life reframing that is kind of a test of the quality of our heart since both the pleasures and the Pains of life or a test of you know your your heart gets tested where we're seeing in the Bible time now
 dada
 cuz I just spoke his prayers to
 Lord Vishnu in the form of nursing my Dave form of the half man half lion and now we're finally going to hear from Lourdes changed himself
 and you know one thing prayers are around
anyone can say them right anyone can can say the words
 but the question is where's the heart at and in one sense Bloods the purity of his heart will be tested when he's offered what do you want I'll Grant you anything you want let's take a look here. I have been a good boy that's you know the the goal about these at the heart melts right it's spoken of that way and in our sacred tax at the heart has to melt and it's a hard doesn't melt
 it said that it's still framed right this is this is really where the box of Yogi is going it's not that I'm just exactly trying to become renowned since we do naturally renounce the external things in this world when we begin to experience the internal so that comes is kind of a byproduct
kind of a secondary thing but really the did the primary concern is what is the what is the state of my heart what is the quality of my heart so that it may become very soft
 and melt in an experiment to share and exchange pure love you know which is kind of mom
 corrupted whenever there's selfish consideration so now we get to look into the heart of the sea the heart of her blood will be tested now
 I was diving fold true some I told you before you started to shoot my bow with which is every means of Conquest when should offer respectful obeisances to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you this super most human being into mother star swathi the goddess of learning and it should be off today of the weather nice top Raves about race Unity

my dear pilade most gentle one best of the family of demons All Good Fortune to you I'm very much pleased with you it is my past time to fulfill the desires of all living beings and therefore you may ask for me any benediction that you desire to be fulfilled there it is it's like the magic magic Stone you can have whatever you want so many stories have been written about this where person is granted wishes only wishes complicate their life more Sugino you see in America that people win the lottery it's like that is like every person's not every person obviously but it's like people every person that doesn't Lottery at least or a person that goes to Vegas it's our dream come true you won the lottery today they say that the what happens is

 a couple of years
 started he lost his he lost his and his brother went to jail like all of these things sort of happened and he ended up being bankrupt after the end of everything because he is broke his brother went to jail because he won the lottery
 you're just saying it was mystical bad luck after this happens and it took all the money a burned-out all the money his mother and it was
it was it was a tragic tragic money did not buy him happiness Attila on the message board says statistically most lottery winners are no happier a year later than they were before before winning the year before yesterday I guess that's a real test of the hard when you win the lottery isn't it yeah how do you what what do you do with it where do you go with it especially if you live in sort of a mission list life we're talking about the why the why we wake up in the morning and if you got a mission you could think of all wonderful things to do with with the the resources got no Mission you just buy a nicer sweater buy an extra pairs of shoes or you know take it up a notch and go even wilder than that sometimes are wilder than a nicer sweater I think so but you know it was interesting here is this last line of the of the verses, portal
Omni Raynham
 Christy says I fulfil every one's desires, Port completely fulfill its very interesting you know it's like but over then how am I going through what I'm going through right now some hot to think about this to think about where receiving what we desire with there's a formula in in like the bug of agita is presentation of reincarnation
 you know this is kind of like a formula that's mentioned it right like through this especially two elements that go into like to determine what our next birth will be and what they are going to no clue they're not on the chalkboard they're not on the chat board and a half with a combination of your desire and then the karmic Merit that you've accrued
once we kind of say okay you know what I want to live independent I don't really want to live in the broader natural Godly kind of Paradigm I want to explore this world you know it is independently then it's kind of like okay I will fulfill that desire right and but buddy will be entering into a realm where in the law of karma is in effect and so you'll you can pursue your desires with that stipulation right and so don't say you die and you have a particular desire like apparently a lot of people in this world desire sexual gratification from what I understand the difficulty it seems to be true probably agree with that said that your primary desire that's what you held in your heart
 like you know who you cherish that you're well your idea of like yeah that's what I want that's that's what the DIA
and I'm say even you know long after you've got the body to really pursue that very but do you know that the desires remained in your heart it's dominated your thought I think the Freud would say that this is you know very common dominate your thoughts right now that's your thoughts go there for all parts used to speak about an old man in the hospital you remember him talking about the old man in the hospital even an old man. The guy he still thinking of some of that the nurse walked in the Tractive and he's just you know his eyes just go right there and if you know it's like you know it in that heart there still do know that desire
 is it is actually really
 informative little anecdote do you know cuz it makes you think you know as a particular as a man I think you know where eyes are prone to wander and you know maintain those kind of Desire I don't want to be like a dirty old man
and unless you start working on it when you're young they're working on your young yeah I don't want to be there because I need it just gets more and more pathetic than any case say that your primary desires so then you combine that with your karmic married have I been kind have I been generous have I you know how about your crude Good Karma and if you combine My Desire with that, if I'm approved good, then I had that desire be fulfilled in a in a really wonderful way ride the way that I really most wanted me right like you know you could have according to the wedding date The Vedas you know you you would send. Higher levels higher planets within the universe where and you giving a body beautiful body composed of composed of matter of a much more refined nature and everybody else has bodies of a much more refined nature and the laws
operators you know on the Earthly realm in regards to sex
 you know it's a much Freer kind of environment and usually liberated it's very it's very liberated like in other words things like
 a lot of the mental
 problems that people have here with it you know or you're free of it there and in the pregnancy issues or completely different thing and it's so I need to let children are born and they grow up immediately so I got the strollers no car seats and whereas if you have that exact same desire but you've accrued you haven't approved good, then you can take birth in the animal species where you know they're very sexually active
 yeah but it's not as you know it's not as satisfying as fun as beautiful inside as refined you know it's but there
for it and that they have that desire in the fulfilling it you know so so Krista here as soon as I fill everyone's desires that's what I do
 if you're in a particular situations because of your desire and I'll fulfill it for you that's what I do so now I'm turning to you for loud and I'm telling you directly I'm ready to fulfill any desire that you have he's praising him for being gentle
 right which you know I think indicates that he is a sensitive he has like he just had this kind of Heart of Gold he's like sensitive to others you know Perry move to this world in such a way that he's concerned for others so you know you could even say you're you know you've earned you know the filming of your innermost desires what do you want to see what's in his heart
 I know you don't even have to look at other people who won the lottery or haven't won the lottery to look at your own life to there's been time
in my life where I had no money and I'm just been what does people live in ostrava living in the ashram was very very fun for me some people don't have maybe some people don't have no good. I had a great time living now from I loved living like a monk who was just had so much good camaraderie and friendship and I'm very extroverted anyway so for me to have 10 guys crammed in a room looks like a like a party and there's but other times of my life where I've had resources but I've also have maybe more desires and more passions is definitely the controlling of the passions in the desires that you find some peace of mind or in or regulation or what the weather is a health regulation of spiritual regulation a dietary regulation that you find some peace and some peace peace and peace of mind and and reciprocal reciprocal happiness with that lifestyle.
not necessarily some almost like it money is sometimes is intangible sometimes you will get a lot of money and they lose them the money but they never have the money in their hand it's just like something some electronic thing in a bank account of the stock market crash nothing actually changed but you just know cuz you heard it on the news that the stock market crashed so it is sometimes it's all fabricated in the mind as well it has a really hasn't necessarily change the quality of your life quality of your life you can actually change that yourself in a lot of ways
 how do the first step
 change your diet that's changing the quality of your life changed when you go to bed when you wake up change taking care of your body or not in your body what about a spiritual level internal an internal level as a meditation practices to your life
 and I met some service to your life
 scene gif
I hope your father Thomas daily meditation I don't mean just like sitting under a tree I also mean I also mean reading can be a meditation reading wisdom literature sitting and chanting City to sit and sing and sit and singing singing prayers that's also what type of meditation change your life immediately and it's something you can do with tons of money or very little money
 thank you recognize
 you're welcome
 what's next 53 guy may you live a long time one cannot appreciate or understand me without pleasing me but one who has seen or please me has nothing more for which to lament for his own satisfaction
 what's the score please me
nothing more for which to lament for
 if anyone else said that it sits at the core of our desires it's the under it it's the desire itself in our heart but we because we're covered by illusion that desire comes out as a I want to go I want to go on a vacation I want to go to the beach or when I go here I want to purchase this I want her or him or want this vehicle or want these rims for my vehicle it all comes out through are contaminated mind but what we really want is gone it's a god-shaped hole in the heart that I've been stuffing so many things in except God so God can say that once you see me you'll be fully satisfied once you please me you won't lament for anything else
 yeah it's so it's not
yag again if someone else said it
 it's this is lacking truth or I could put like it's it's it's it's a question of them tougher his question category
 in other words one leaf might say to another if you just wanted me you're going to be satisfied but it's not a fax you know but if the roots as if you just spoil to me all you leaves are going to be satisfied right it's it's because the snow is the root of all existence When Love is directed there or when one thing you do is to satisfy me the only way that he is satisfied is through love you know if and so he sang here's a formula for happiness or leave it set up a formula for wholeness you know
 that just like the leaf of a tree it has a particular categorical intrinsic relationship with the root of the tree all the leaves have that same room
since you're with a root if the road is satisfied with water every living Leaf at you every leaf on the tree is satisfied or the way that like a part of a machine has a relation to the whole you know it's it's situated when it's in its right place and Performing is to write a function and so this is like a categorical statement where additional saying if you please me you become please that's how what if you try to please yourself separately you don't really become pleased but if you simply try to reconnect with your Source here
 try to please me you become police and that's just the way that's that's the natural situation you know you are natural Cosmic Universal formulas that's how it works I'm thoroughly convinced if we lean into this philosophy really into this pocket philosophy we will solve not only our own personal problems we will solve all the world's problems
we don't have to do anything external to solve The World's problems I think this is where people get confused you have the answer right here you have the treasure chest it's right sitting on our laps you just got to personally crack open that lock right open it up and get out the well and the wealth is there and it was radically in a radically recreate your Consciousness in your mind and your thoughts in the way you treat yourself and your self suffering from lack of self-love it'll give yourself love if you do it right it'll give love to other people if you do it right and it was spread that threw up and that is the Urgent thing we have to speak to people and that's why we are so adamant about sharing this was with other people with you know sharing the video share the clips it's important it actually will transform the world
 very interesting right because in a sentence I love the way that you said it is that
 what were you started we said if that we all just sucks.
bored with it all just did the internal work then the external will all fall into place right
 it'll start falling into place if we're all centered around one central figure if we all you know revolved around 1 Central axis and his Harmony and we only revolve around it we might talk about revolving around it but we don't really revolve around it until we do the internal work right in other words he couldn't hear Vision saying if you satisfy me that means revolve around me right you know connect with me through love seeing me as as your central see your love for me and developing that love for me as your central concern in life and in what sense like all the spiritual Traditions ideally are saying that's just what we need to do right take your life make a revolve around God you know in doing so
meet your necessarily become considerate of other living beings in doing so you will necessarily not be get caught up in a blind competition for resources because you become satisfied simply and so on and you know people will say you know all religion is the cause of all the wars and in this and that well it's not definitely not the cause of all the wars even statistically want to measure that and understand it's not a yes it's not an actress in it but the problem is is that whatever religious / spiritual
 teachings are out there
 our problem is that we approached them on a superficial level you know but if we were to take it you know if you have a really deep Christian and a really deep Jew and a really deep Muslim and a really deep Native American and a really deep Hindu and a really deep Buddhist and you put them all together they're going to do fine
it if you take a very shallow Christian in a very solid you in a very shallow excetera excetera and you put them on the road you're going to have chaos it's not it's not the spiritual teaching that caused it is the lack of depth in the spiritual teaching that caused all the tension you know I think we touched on this a little bit and Q and A day yesterday but I was pondering it was thinking about it and it's really true like because I Lead Teacher trainings and leave pilgrimage is at lead
 you know weekend Retreats at the farm and there's different varieties of them especially in the old days when I always spoke about bhakti but some people are just like wow this guy can do handstands I want to go to this Retreat or this guy knows a lot about yoga I want to go to this Retreat cuz I think you'll get will help me either physically or maybe a more spiritual person but as we started focusing things around the podcast
and the regular hearing from you don't like my students your students about bhagva Tom about God is the center about we are part of something bigger and we need to do not just external things to our body but internal work for a mind of how we treat people how we treat ourselves of our thoughts of our Envy of our fault finding of are appreciating people that has radically changed our Retreats because it's not like people are going to retreat because when when there's a different focal point and what is Major most people spoke a point how can I enjoy
 how can I enjoy this I want to go somewhere so I can enjoy and said you join me just the way I wanted I start to get a little annoyed ways that you're not enjoying how you could enjoy more and how these person is getting in the way of my enjoyment
guy in the bunk above me is getting in the way of mind you want to have a food you know is not exactly what I wanted and I was expecting something different and I was hoping it would be like this and where our lives are riddled with expectations or how I can fill my senses know something different when people come to a Savory treat its how can I give to the center how can I get to the whole or in people have that God conscious philosophy that God is in the center I'm part of something bigger I'm not going to mind their business I'm going to mind my business I'm going to stop trying to find fault I'm going to go out of my way to find the good in people that radically changes everyone's happiness including your own do you think a person that's running around trying to fill up their own needs and desires and expectations is any more happy they're not be entitled person is much less happier
seeing the good not only did they become peaceful and joyous and connected
 but everybody around them feels that in that like we had people just like running around rendering selfless service for yoga retreats so to speak in the kitchen and staying up late cleaning things all with smiles on their faces not out of like oh man I got kitchen detail I got KP Duty or no it was the opposite there was a joy in their hearts is so many people are like I'll let me take your plates let me take your plates I was like who you the waiter was one of the not paid hey to be if I can keep and he's going around playing the waiter somebody else's in the kitchen just in a washing the dishes
 it feeling more connected and more happy satisfied and all the leaves
you taking care of it's true a family level is true enough Retreat level is 2 and it is it's true in the Township in the state of nation Township and internationally in the burger
 the Berg in the burg going to have the Burgermeister
 in Pittsburgh
 where we at another who versus left for today please no from me that those who are very wise and highly elevated try to please me in all different modes and Nello's modes of melo's
 Lowe's modem elohe where Moses Malone from all the desires
 every one of them is leading
when God gives you whatever you want but that's we're just talking about it to physical Amazon Prime I was going to just give me everything
 that's what he said couple versus ago and that's what is repeating right here
 I don't find it to be true what I find that to be true is God either gives me things that I desire only so I realize that those things one actually satisfy me so they did give them that sometimes but sometimes he gives me the intelligence to realize my desires are not actually going to fill me anyway oh well involve desires sometimes by taking away those desires to desire in such a way that you'll never desired again
 that's for the devotees he does that especially you
 your butt here you know it in here is there's a there's a bit of foreshadowing of what will come later in the bar with him
especially in the 10th cancer right were you saying you know if you're intelligent. He says very wise and highly elevated right he says they're deira very sober you know they're not confused by in a bewildered by the things of this world that they they they they please him
 Ed and here is it gives you a clue about what this is all about why it's not some narcissistic individual why is not some sick sick God that's just making people serve young they said they do it in all different modes of Nello's this is a direct reference to the to the different Russ's right that that it 111 spirituals becomes very elevated when the heart becomes very pure becomes very soft
 good morning here's the holy name of Krishna it melts and it and what's in there
the Mellow that the particular type of love that one one has fore God becomes reveals you start to feel you start to love God not in a general sense but in a very particular way they love God like a friend Emile of Godlike with a kind of love that a parent has for a child to mail of God like in a romantic way with your this is the esoteric side of boxing and this is saying that so saying if you were very wise and very elevated then you begin to please God not just like through through a stereo through give me something of her through following some kind of moral code
 but now you're pleasing god with a very particular flavor or mellow in love love
 lucky last one last first of this chapter Naruto said
 nardis narrating this Claude was the best person in the family of the demons and had bad parents bad bad family
always has some fire for material happiness write nonetheless although a Lord by the Supreme personality of God had to offer him all benedictions for material happiness because of his unalloyed Krishna Consciousness he did not want to take any material benefit or sense gratification
 you don't want to take any but you're all right I want to get into this more at a later date are the best among the exalted devotees married we have any takeaways for today so that we can bring with us some little piece of gold we can pull out of our pocket when we use when things are of course Provo
 all right if it's connected to damara ever let us down when we ask that question
sometimes I do crowd-source it from the chat board but if it's connected to the vanity can be Eternal beauty is our currency the markets going to crash course that's referring to the external beauty right not to be his true beauty is to develop a heart of gold winning the lottery doesn't buy happiness
 no matter what you say yeah Jamie Steptoe Joe had some more to say on that right 11.7% 1 million can't buy you happiness is a melting heart
that's right Nike
