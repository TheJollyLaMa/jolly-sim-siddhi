Honda Grom or a lot of us especially in the west we hear brindavan we sort of lump everything together we lump in go over down be lump and go cool we lump in all the different bonds of brush all the different for Sandbridge can you explain the difference when we when we say vrindavan when we say none to Grom so people can understand
 actually the overall area which has spread about 84 mi in the area is known as Bridge originally brush is the area where Krishna performed all his past times when he was here
 and inside Branch there are different Villages or different places which have different names like when the oven brindavan is 11 specific town which was one forest and Ashley in
there are many many Forest of the rainforest in in in garage then there's go over there and then there is Nunda g g the original village where krishna's house family house was and also another Village the house of symmetry.
 This all comes into the area of bragging
 what is the difference between Borussia or NG were Krishna Hare Krishna originally grew up and how long did he live there for lunch today on the day of Jenna Master me in the J love comes down as we all know and the same night he was transferred by what's today in the village of Google on one side of of yamuna is Madara on the underside
Goku where Nana Maharaj live
 with the whole family and when he was transferred from the jail of comes to the Village of Google
 on the on the next day not the Mirage and all the other boys did came to know that dude. As taking birth in the house with nothing but they also knew that the comes the demon comes as announced that any new child has been born in in the area of the day with that have treated him as the son of David Key would come to kill him and our son has not taken by our daughter is sick and birth from from Dave a key so you should order soon and kept it a secret that a child has taken birth in their own family
and 3 days
 for two years and three days in the Mirage did not make like a big official announcement that I have to go to stand and let you know I want to celebrate his birthday very properly otherwise because the council and the demons would know
 it was all sort of underground in the sort of quiet he didn't America in America they do things like hand out cigars that's what they do when a child is born so when the Demons of comes I started harassing or disturbing than the Mirage in Krishna balaram wanted his son to be protected so they shifted from Google
 Amanda Graham close to Five Mile
it's just like 40 Mi away from mathura
 animal cells and all that along with him after themselves from Goku to G & G restaurant that in the Demons of Gangsta would not disturb them there because I'm great money from dinner money that if they come try to enter into the area of NG turn into stone so this is a Christian Margo Swami has a great perspective he's from a family that worships these DVDs for at least eight hundred years
 and I'm
 it his family is now presently worshiping these DD's on John Moss to me so it's it is very especially if there's family members are I guess there might be like cousins or something and they take turns
in the worship of the deity
 so when you go to none degrom it's an entire scene of
 how do you describe it just like an entire community that just doesn't even think of Krishna as their lord they think of Krishna is just their their child is here they're just one of the children here and they have so many different songs and so many different festivals that go on it's almost like your village is always in best Festival mode and right now probably is the biggest Festival of the year
 yes
 ostrich noise. Like a big philosopher concept or like a supreme person he's like our own family member and you know on family members you really have you know
you really give something to him and you really take something from him so in the next part of our you're going to hear something wonderful how intricate the relationship of bridal parties is with Christian the people that live in this bridge bridge area Bridge bossy
 okay so today Chris Maragos mom is going to take us on a journey into the heart of an underground so just one other question so if none degrom is were Krishna is the child then bring David will be always speak about bringing Ava that's where he has his love affairs with the gopis is that correct actually his his house is in the ground and From The Underground in the morning he goes to her dad's cows and to perform many many Past Times in all the different different Forest
example he goes to rent. He goes to, and he goes to Mahogany and he goes to bed he goes to Taliban he goes to 122 all different places he goes to perform different print pastimes to to enjoy it differently in different colors
 okay will you please take us on a guided tour now
 we are ready to get into Bridge Consciousness today on this holy day and we wanted to do it with you that's why we could be the special invitation
 actually when Christian was born and he was happy that he wanted
 to give so many things in charity he wanted you know that he he he wanted to thank everyone in the village
before the first time then the more I wanted to celebrate the birthday of Krishna
 the celebration took place for the first time in Mandeville by the house of God which is located in the underground
 so
 now we are going to going on a journey to to Really witness to really be there in under one in the same Courtyard and what is really it's like to be there yes we are ready take me away
 it is said everywhere outside you have to make Krishna part of your plans being being in New York City you have to find time to do I have do you have this wonderful wisdom of the ages podcast
I have to connect with Krishna but in reality friend
 how is it different. Krishna makes you part of his own plans when you are there in Brush
 this is this is one of the very significant difference
 as soon as as soon as the gopis order but there is no residents have heard that a beautiful son African birds in the House of Night
 everyone has gathered together
 and they have started walking towards the street just takes them towards the house of London
 today
beautiful boobies I have gathered together and started walking towards the house of Nanda Mirage
 you look so beautiful day even hold very good golden color plates the golden place in their hand and they are very beautiful and everyone is just boring and they're singing as they are moving towards the house in the Mirage they're singing greetings and as soon as they have entered
 the house of naan The Mirage they have beautiful turmeric and henna powder out of which they have made beautiful paste and they're making auspicious symbols auspicious decorations on the house on the Gate of men The Mirage
 and then when they entered inside now
do they see
 busy but there are some free some faces are looking from
 they are seeing one person which have such a beautiful crown who looks like
 but he's not getting the respect as he gets inside Luca is just running here and there are even some even pushing him down here and everyone wants to see even more to go and see the child of mine tomorrow
 but everyone is looking after this
 also there's one lady who look like Lakshmi but she's making flower garlands there she has no other service except making flower garlands like with Mariah's doing something
end
 no the Guppies who are sitting in one corner and some copies are sitting in another Corner they're talking some gossip amongst themselves so many different types of people in the courtyard of Nevada
 they're sitting there talking amongst themselves Port heads
 this one Baba this one stand with whom they can see who had forehead who is he
 is ibrahima ottoman himself the sweet boy of mana mana
 another go pee stain
who is this person was big dreadlocks and he has a Veena and he's trying to play is he nada
 another sake scooting osaki is he still up
 getting the skin of a tiger
 what's the key for small boys doesn't really look like they're not welcome here and who wish to greet when the matters and who is playing sweet musical sounds from the clouds
 all this is happening and the Guppies have now come and they're seeing Krishna for the first time
 and there is.
Frozen coming out of the same palanquin where Krishna being swing back and forth back and forth by the Black Eyed Peas
 no they are singing the greatest glorification about the beautiful Fortune about the great Fortune of mother
 they are glorifying mother today you're such a good fortune today on this 8th day of the month of body part
 at the time when you give birth to this beautiful child
 all the planetary systems streamlined themselves
 into a very unique auspicious direction directions
 all these beautiful Guppies when they kick when they come
it is a general tradition in in bread and some of specious moment you start singing auspicious songs you sing auspicious verbal abuse
 can you get a verbal abuse sweet verbal abuse
 tell me that you mean this thing like this. Oh my God you're so fortunate you're so fortunate maybe all the
 demigods from all the different styles maybe they came personally in the night to bless you with this beautiful child if you don't know what have you done are you a magician or what because you are wide
Amana just right and how come your son and you have given birth is black out of this such beautiful sarcastic remarks or jokes with mother as soon as they try to increase the the happiness among everyone you know when there's some person who always play some nice jokes create a different flavor a different mood
 very familiar mood because the young Guppies who have just now married you know there are some ladies who were married already many many years before and now there are some who just got recently married who doesn't have any child up till now all these groupies.
in front and they're touching the feet of mother yesterday and asking blessings from a derecho de and please bless us so that we can also have a beautiful child like in like your son in in in in our life
 in this way a big ocean of Guppies and Go pass have enter into the house of London
 and there's 11 grouper caught boy who was announced to everyone by standing on the roof of London
 no one should go to the forest today because
 you have to bring all the towels in the car to the house of naan The Mirage today because he has been blessed by a beautiful sun in the house of Mandi Baba
and when everyone hears this because everyone was doing this that none of my life was that was really looking to have a child in in his house at the age of 90 years ago at the age of 90 years child at the age of 80 years when you receive something at a specific you feel so happy like anyting and the child was also so so happy and so so blissful
 no
 after this gopis. Our boys have come even when you can see on on different directions the cows are coming and they're beautiful dress. It is said that the horns of the cows
Golden Leaves the Hooves of the cows are decorated with silver leaves
 and all of them have come and just by seeing the beautiful form of Krishna started branching there milk in their heart out of compassion the cows are fading away all the milk milk they have when she leaves the milk from her doctor and the CAF can really drink and there's one specific how was trying to even let the little bit size sheets of Krishna
 after this there are groupers who are so happy out of joy
4th Street with butter yogurt and milk and saffron in it
 it is considered to be very auspicious you know what thing which you sprinkle everywhere to create auspiciousness and curity so they're sprinkling it over into another into another and end this like a big big slippery surfaces become who are you know some are dancing to the sounds of a a like a like a one is dancing like anything you just see some some old Indian mythology who just comes and dances speciality like anybody somebody dancing like this and some are trained
hug each other
 as if as if the sun has not only taken birth in the house of naan The Mirage just so happy as this one son has taken birth in the house of all of them
 the whole village of bread has come to the house of the Mirage to give gifts and to receive gifts from The Mirage
 this is the real give-and-take Between the Bread boxes and then the Mirage and Krishna and they also expect things from the Mirage
 can I ask a question, I'm going to put you on pause for a second and I just like to ask a question a practical question about in this season John must have me Christian is a birth Tricia's appearance rather are there special songs that you sing at the temples
but when it when the different festivals I remember when we were there with for Holy there was all these holy songs you brought out of special holy drum are there special festivities that are going on there at this time there are there are in the worship structure of of brother two things are very important
 vicious Raga envogue
 Naga means the specific different Melodies are different song which which you sing for the pleasure of the Lord and buga means what you physically offer to the Lord in different season before different seasons we have different offerings and different songs
 but this special season of Jenny Master me everywhere if you tell anyone from India
 none.
in the house of Madness Mirage
 mendigar Anand bhayo Jai kanhaiya Lal Ki aarti what are cysts
 he has given cows he has given elephant and he hasn't even given palanquins to everyone because you know he he he wished to give so many different different items to everyone who ever designed
 on the day when Krishna Alvin and the Mirage was celebrating the
a son's birthday it is said he gifted
 200000 cows
 200000 cows to the Promenade, is to get some milk because the fragrance of White Lotus
 he has given different mounts different mounts of different other than 12 as a gift to all the prejudices
 and he has made he has made all the beggars in 2 Kings
 for example you know if someone comes and you know
 disseminate
 if someone
okay if someone comes and you know he gives us like so much wealth so much wealth that you know in like 10:00 lifetimes so this much
 now I wish to share our beautiful little story of a beggar please
 when was the birthday of Krishna time too many beggars too many recipients came to the house at 9 tomorrow and they were asking for specific things
 animals give too much in charity that all the Beggars turn into Kings
and there was a big big line of of of things people who look like things was coming out from the house of naan The Mirage there was one beggar who was connected with the family of man The Mirage in India are you usually have there are these people who keep the records of your family Generations as soon as they come to know that our new member has taken birth into the house of the family of which was recorded really keep
 so no matter how was this person lived in in in the in the village of Gordon
 and when he saw that someone so many things are coming from the side of a Honda Grom
belong to people who were Beggars to Kings by the gift of things if Beggars but because Nana has given so much to us you look like things play record Keepers like you can find out your Generations past it and they must be from family lineages of record Keepers themselves
 yes late for my own family there are people you know who who come out like once in two years to our houses and check on if there's someone who has taken bertagnoli in the family and they can tell me like four was my
grandfather well okay continue on with our journey so this person has come and then he's going to watch NG all the family members have also known to him like he's a family members are also told your son if you're going to the house of none of his all also asked for business listings for example if they probably were going to New York City and then turn Govinda Mara and everyone they give you a like a list if you're going to the supermarket you bring this this this this for me in the same way this whole family members have expressed their own desires
 this beautiful to this person
 his father has conveyed His blessings turn on the Mirage audio song
you can be my blessings to him and for me you have to ask for $40 and each cow
 and I was do Scouts should be each couch to give at least 40 liters of milk
 umbrella bottle in the calculation of bread 40kg means one man like in 101 1000 kgs in one month there are Portuguese
 after defeating after him the elder brother of his father came to him and said asked for for 7:00 for me to Scouts should be super healthy ones like really healthy ones not like skinny cows
 and after him
 after
his son game he's expressing like this
 photos of potential for 10 horses for himself and when he expressed to me that I I I want 10 horses from them tomorrow so he said why do we why do we want 10 horses cuz you got just one and what will you do with 10 horses he said obituary of father
 you are so innocent
 horse riding is a sport which is only enjoyable when when there are friends with you with whom you can compete so I want 10 horses because all of my other friends can also stay on the horse
and we can rest we can read each other after that this person has reached the house of expressing all that all these things too numerous and you have to give this thing this thing this thing to me
 also his daughter said I need all the different ornaments with Mother issue that veers
 then he said that when my mother came to know that I'm going to the house of naan The Mirage he has given a big part of of of Street yogurt for you he said that when you go to the house of a of a family man you just you always try to bring some something as as gift to him
 o baba
 at last he expresses something very wonderful very hard.
he says the condo Baba although all of my family members have expressed too many things in the mind from you but the Baba
 I just want two things from you the first thing is your big hand because money buys very big very tall in height on the back by your big and full of blessings should always be upon my head if you always bless me everything in my life will be taken care and Baba the last thing that I want to ask from you is Baba
 please don't ask me to leave your house
 until or unless I see two things
 what are the two two things he said the first thing that I want to see is I want to see your little son walking in your courtyard
the second thing is
 I want to hear him calling you baba baba and I want him to I want myself to hear calling your mother a soda is Maya Maya and I will hear this then only I can go over to my house and before that please please don't ask me to leave imagine how beautiful imagine how beautiful it is to hear Christmas first words
 I said there's a special you know in in the house of each and every moment is a festival like we all stay in the oven everyday is a festival start in the house of each moment is a festival in Crystal like anyting
 there's a festival of Krishna you no speak the first word the first word
I said was Maya the hardest to call drama she give into lots of things in Charity she she she pretty, Ryan that you can speak properly Maya means mother so I was so that was Christmas first word mother started walking when I started working on a speech for the first time once again for the first time when I started learning to milk the cows it was a festival
 and then when the Baba hide this request from The Record Keeper of his family or you have touched my heart like anything whatever you have asked that I give you double
among men The Mirage gave him so much in charity and after this
 when this person has like clarified his conversation with all the other now they're trying to see that none of the gopis are the Guppies are looking towards Krishna with they're in the small palanquin
 and they are like they're doing like this in Broad usually the old ladies or the messages when they see someone something very beautiful they always do like this like this like this how beautiful how beautiful is he may he be always me he
please be protected me he always be protected all this is done by by the older Lego pieces when the orderly go pee so Krishna the all day like this to Krishna and they started giving blessings to Krishna
 the groupies are singing blessings to Krishna Singh Rani Tero Chiriqui yoga Pall Poonam dharani Sun live for millions and millions and millions of years may he grow very fast
 all glory to your good fortune that you have given birth to such a beautiful child. The one of the biggest difference between
Pisces and the common people
 and ask for blessings from Krishna
 did give blessings to mother yesterday and they ask blessings from moderation is in the common people ask for blessings
 I'm telling that these have a very distant relationship with Krishna and his family
 they also asked for a blessing from Krishna blessings from none of this is a very distinct thing from a from the bosses singing about the great Fortune of mother
 just so.
geeky girl or describe your great Fortune
 the Supreme person who is inaccessible to Brahma and Shiva, you have given birth to him from your own boom boom other issues on him and they just want to see him for a fraction of a second but they cannot really reach him when this little child when he starts jumping into the into the bridge into the death of Brenda went into the dust of garage and he makes with the dust it just takes a handful of dust
 shopping
over his whole body and when he he looks even more amazing and then my mother sees him at first mother wants to test a Krishna I just I just give you the best food just five minutes before and what have you done but when Tristan grandmother to go see the beautiful face of Christmas Marling at her she forgets everything and the boy who has episode text Krista on her on her lap and try to feed
 feed him
 Modesto lights to fortune that the Supreme personality of God in whose lap in his own body holds all the three worlds all the three words emanates from the body of Krishna
 the one who holds
all the three words in his lab Mother Should I so fortunate that she's holding that Supreme person in our own land
 credible incredible has a sweet baby Krishna Extravaganza today Mara that's what's going on today thank you for bringing this okay we have 15 minute more minutes left what do you have for us I'm just going to sit here and listen
 another thing is
 during during the celebration time like the celebration of Mendota
 is it is it was not ending at all like everyone who came to the house and I just didn't want to go out
 everyone just want to be there because such auspiciousness such happiness such joy as they are spread out in the house of naan The Mirage
no one wants to leave no one at all like for example if you go to a big concert or like a big show you know the audience or the crowd is always like once more once more you know if you don't want to go if you don't want to go
 it was much much beyond that everyone was just just there and
 after all all these different days make when the celebration was somehow the other ended there was always someone coming and going coming and going coming and going to the house at 9 tomorrow and mother issues too concerned about the little child that he just wanted to gather as many blessings SSC code from all the different people who would come one day
 Lord Shiva himself

then
 it just goes outside the house. And he just sits there with his desired with this hope that will show himself to me
 after this mother is deceased and started crying like anything in the house and he's not testified he calls back the same Yogi.
 As if he has done some black magic over the son of Lord Shiva become so happy so happy like anything that he does a very specific ritual there's a specific ritual if someone is affected by jealousy or someone is affected by some negative energy of common
then you just stick Mustard Seed and some rock salt
 some Mustard Seed and rock salt
 and you just move
 separation massage seats and rocks all around the body of the person for three times and then you throw that away into the field by this the negative energy of a person get removed from mustard seeds and rock salt write that down
 when Lord Shiva this ritual to Krishna Krishna started smiling and as soon as the first time he cried he literally cried into tears it right into great tears out of ecstasy to see
 the unlimited turning himself into a limited.
lime that Infiniti has a limit
 so today the Infinity power. 3 world has turned himself out of love out of affection just to please just to win over the hearts of the devotees yes turning himself into a into a small boy of men the price into tears after

 Christmas pastimes are in brats are really Eternal they are not as bad as the learning people say that some learning people are more foolish than the foolish that's for sure the Philadelphia police people say Christmas in Romanian is a Greek mythology but he Krishna inside is a living real
who is still living in his own house in the van and if you ever come to none of the one you can really feel that his presence is still there okay so when we go on pilgrimage this year if you're coming with us we are going to meet up with Chris Mariah goswami and maybe go to maybe go to none of them on this year with the group mr.
