 you doing good Rodger you doing good my 18 year old daughter bought a new
ninja motorcycle
 you know the ones that goes 0 to 70 and 3 seconds that one to get like she didn't get like a laid-back Royal Enfield she got a ninja
 she's eighteen she do whatever she wants your house reach my friend congratulations on the new book of scuba area is there is is I got this. Put this story is it so I didn't have this book
 and so I bought it and look at that looks like us look like me modeling for this if you're not on YouTube resume not going to see this but there is a guy that looks just like how did that happen it look what I got a case of my books in the mall
 is that cool this is real it's a real book coming out
haven't got it amazon.com working at one of my shows is going to be at my shows in Tampa
 and my show Miami was coming up in a couple weeks that I hang out with Linda Linda Linda she's going to be there with Mara they're both stage-diving and if you did order it go back and double it
 give what to look for and the scuba what's out you don't know it was great to see you, this is second time you're acting like you bring me in until you think of something to say about your own life and then you go with that and then when you run out of speed then you turn back if you remember something about your life and you come back and tell you but it's okay I want to hear what you have to say we had a conversation sometime yesterday during that drive
yeah you and I and then I remember where I was but we was yesterday sometime
 and we both were like sharing a realization about everything and we both came to the same conclusion yes rub that was
 we are what we said the other day what's our Adela are algorithms we are sharing the same brain algorithms which is our spiritual life depends on a retentive chanting that's what it came down to depend on Michael Jody I just bought it doesn't depend I'm a time I went to the other night it doesn't depend on it it depends on me sitting and hearing the holy name and that's where I like my and it's been my sort of like commitment would like the last six months and I will say I struggled with it in India just because it's so much stuff is going on and I'm going to chop a walk all the time I'm over jabberwocks I'm going to Joppa sit sit in here
Holy Name could be back in my little chair sitting in front of my paintings of Krishna and just chill and that's enough to make a healthy fertilizer to make this body lot to grow stronger and stronger and stronger
 send lesson chanting chanting is the
 it's not I can't minimize chanting minimize everything else but don't minimize the chanting at this is you know that these these are my what are they called affirmation
 no more just chatting to get the rounds done
 no. That was nice that was nice no more accurate don't knock off your Joppa no way
and no more inattentive chanting in general just cannot be and what you just what you just said
 chant more than the 60 because if you only like another you and I have taken since we even further are you just let me feel good about myself for a day wasn't talking about you I was just these are my application but I did phrase that as you I didn't mean you individual talking about Humanity in general but here's the thing you and I have taken vows to chance 16 rounds if we only chance 16 and then we stopped it really means we have no taste for it it's like admitting it's just like giving up like I jammed my 16 but I only do that much because I have to if you're if we're not chatting more if we don't want to pick up the beads after we finish the 16 at some point in the day then that means we haven't
and I think if we start to chat more than the 16 and just really make that are natural common kind of way to work I appreciate that. That's the realization you got for you that's good I mean I got a bunch of new books excited we're logging books home like trunks of books I have some books to there is heavy you know looks are having any cool books for the gift shop excited about everything
 I was having one of the most wonderful
 experiences studying today in my life cuz there's some things I need to share what I've been I've been having doing some stuff here
 Channel 16 Rams double it
you always wanted to tell that devil it out there didn't you do a fact I wish I did know I was going to get rounds I doubled it
 I left I left my poor on Saturday Saturday morning before I left I went into again I went into the tovp in the
 the national Dave Wing that was recently that Dino is still more finished when I went in there on Saturday morning they had a big if you go to YouTube and you go to my poor
 is it my poor TV or it's my son about my poor and he has to come from behind so not knowing stuff I sent I sent the link to rub but yeah yeah that Temple is magnificent already and so it's going to be insane when the whole thing is done it
it in and out only that but it feels auspicious it feels like the string and Dave will be installed and he's going to remove the obstacles to accomplish this incredible task of you know that Temple is it's a dead temples going to be alive with energy is going to expire peoples going to purify the minds the heart I have a lot of I have a lot of faith in there but in case that was really really nice and I drove down to Calcutta
 I love Calcutta has become my favorite city is a dirty dirty sitting do you like it so much I went off and whatever another thing I was thinking today I was saying you know like because last night I went to this some aarti on the on the bank of the ganga here in recirculation is hoping seeing you know they got 14 pujari's doing it you know Worship in ganga Devi
big lamps and everything in the whole thing is that it's a big mess of masses of people and it's it's kind of what you didn't go to the one in which it called no I went to the one in order to make a time frame to the nearer one which is more like a local think less of a Taurus thing and more like a local thing and you know there's something like messy but pure you know this dirty is another thing dirty is in pure messy and pure beings like hell I just sat down in a bunch of orange stuff but it's wholly I just put my flip flop in a big thing of cow dung but it's hardly have no idea it's messy but it's pure like Hinduism in like up here in rishikesh in the whole place is messy but messy pure pure messy messy
 Calcutta dirty
but but not all of it and there's nothing you or element cuz the ganga runs through it and everybody worships Krishna or collie you know I mean people are doing are teks and there's still a strong religious sentiment in all over in Calcutta no doubt and so I got that you know I didn't eat all day I didn't manage to eat until like 7 at night or something like that the whole day yeah so Anna and you know I was driving in my driver driving me down was one of these stop-start guys you know like the break like that so I was like hungry nauseous tired like a whole thing when I got there and I checked into the hotel first and I have to weigh to check in and then I went up and then I get then I came back down at set up
 and then they set up a ride for me to take me to my whole mission and going to Calcutta was to go to Ulta dunga Junction Temple.
historic recently restored Temple where she'll about to sit on that starts with the top of the we've been speaking about recent on the show where he this was like I think it was like his first temple in Calcutta that's the place that's the way there yet he stay there from 1918 until 1930 and that is the place for sure the prompt I'd walk up onto the roof bow down to him and by the time she'll probably is coming up probably 22 years old at the time she was about to send out the Stars by the taco said to him and his friend you to just say you two young men like you to speak English well you should be teaching the the pure teachings of a body in the western world around the whole globe you know and that was an order that he permitted in the very first words is Gru spoke to him and he held that in his heart from when he was 22
 until he was seven years old that he landed on the shores of of the mineral rights pretty cool like time and preparation
left so warm that Temple and it was a you know it was like kind of like ruins they restored it so nice and peaceful e l go beautifully and it was so nice and you go up on that roof and you could feel her presence she looks about to sit on that show the proper I was very moved and you know when people really put her heart into that kind of restoration work and do it with such thoughtfulness and so Tastefully it it brings out the Bob that you're meant to feel that brings out the inner mood that you're meant to feel when you're there and they did it they pulled it off the place is like a jewel you know it's like Christina to go and I was like no it was one of those famous borders I heard that you're going to inspired
I am going to the restroom but I do have a story about that was so then every time their scent of rides for me and cut cut it was like taking forever like I said the hotel set up an Uber ride and then they cancel the song it took me like the wait about an hour to sit in the hotel waiting for a ride and then the same thing was kind of happened in there that they fed me some kid tree as like I'm so hungry and not and they gave me a big plate of kitchen is looking a scent is this I knew it was going to be spicy right like like I might not be able to eat any of it they just let you know I said it is going to be spicy how can I said and that's exactly was I could I could eat it and I ate the whole plate and it just
 them that Prasad I'm just entering my system and healed me you know it was Gray
yeah and I was in such as flying so high cuz I just seen that place as feeling just wonderful feelings inside and then I was sitting in your kind of sit on the stoop of the place it's really cool, like a real Hangouts sweet people they're cool people pulled Calcutta people just old ladies that a little short little old man Godly ladies come in there all Pious is a short culture isn't it's a short a short people and they're all tall are kind of like New Yorkers you know they got a certain they do very New York is very New York and so is real I love in the vibe and then so then they gave me this Uber ride to call his it also took like about 40 minutes and then the ride from show me this a boo your ride is here and look and I don't see it

 you know this is not a good way to die know I was thinking like I didn't want this to become like you know who I am heading home but it's like if if someone so Swami was here would you be putting on the back of his motorcycle and and how many rungs down the we value your life ladder
yeah yeah it's kind of a life is cheaper they accepted eternity of the Soul that's what I had to do I just remember I told you the day before I left it was just like I'm in Crystal's hands I don't know where I'm going to sleep I don't know what I'm going to eat I'm just going you know it and I just accepted that motorcycle Rack in that mood and was interesting that's good cuz me and Marisa during the worst turbulence ever on that flight home I was like okay I guess today is the day I did wasn't expecting it today but you did it all on Instagram I like everybody on a plane to hitting the ceiling that hitting the floor they go to the left and then a hole in the plane and people getting sucked out the whole I was like all right that's it I'm at work I'll have to have that if some scar on my Consciousness forever anyway I don't want to go into this more cuz we have some things we have to give away silver Chelsey Morales

aesthetic sense you know is there and everything he does and he's sitting up on there's one kind of there two stages and he's sitting up at 1 and I just looked at my said this man is stuck by 70

But but you feel it it's thick in the air stick in the atmosphere you know and you sit by the bank of that river that you know Sage is for so many centuries of sat right there and bathe right there to to connect with God within their hearts to see Garden in nature and any kind of get caught up in their moment you know you feel you feel that momentum you know when the momentum of the river coming down and get into that cold water

What time witches are very means a conquest when should I be respectful of base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan reshoot the super most human being with other saraswoti the goddess of learning and search for the office today of the author
stop play a show about race Unity is troublesome to the Harley Quinn ride at Kaden and loving service to the Supreme Lord he was praised the transit of the songs we established as a revocable fact home again at the mud on trucks Toyota Middletown de natas my day going to be
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers opening my eyes or the torch out of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their load of speed reading for the shoot by Baga Tom Canto 7 chapter 5 test 25 we are in deep we still haven't finished the purport of 23 24
I'll bring us back up to date the saintly little perlot
 was asked by his father again what's the best thing you learn in school he was hoping it was going to say something like how to destroy the enemy all the dry tactics and whatever he does not reset he said to them the Snows smart and butter saving them. You know that I'm the same suck your mom and he said he listed the nine practices of pure devotional service and that upset his father but we haven't gotten to that part was probably get some said yeah but we we read this is a very I think a true Prophet as long as commentary where he at length speaks about each one of these nine we heard about shoving him which means hearing the Texas Human bog with Tom summer text you heard about kirtan under the hearing the chanting of the Holy names of Krishna
we heard about smart and you can call The Meditation and remembering or meditating in a medicine especially in the past times I was doing some serious smart I'm doing that turbulence Alexa I'm sorry I don't know that smart yes it was desperately for your nice Americorps slept through the whole thing
 she did try to save them
 does that mean
 serving the Lotus feet of his feet example of how to say about him that we Lakshmi Devi speaks about it let's see what he writes about ready
 he says 11 is and by the way this is just an excerpt from this playlist
I know you can stop me at all kind of things he said when one is particularly adhering to the process of pot of saving them this process gradually includes other processes to include other things what does it mean to be serve the feet
 such as seeing the form of the Lord
 touching the form of the Lord you're not here I think we're speaking about the arch you knows who all the archon has and the next thing online with the car perform circumambulating in the form of the Lord the formal or Temple of the Lord visiting such places as Juggernaut pori dwarka and Matera to see the Lord's form and bathing in the Ganges and yamuna
 bathing in the Ganges and serve a violation of us are also known as tadia opossum
 do you know what's a DM means
no quiz today there's a famous verse what was it
 vaishnava what is it
 ADM Smartwatch and I'm asking around and this is what she was speaking to Parvati around and on I'm starvation around and on them of all different types of worship or out of 9 mm Target Vishnu around a number on the worship of Vishnu is the highest
 but then he says what is it something something Davey 2D and I'm Samara Samara chunem the to serve that which is related to Lord Vishnu
 you still even higher
 and that especially means the people that are related to vision of the people that are dear to Lord so saying worship of Lord Vishnu is the highest but where's me that way
in relation to be because that pleases me even more those who claim to be my devotees are not my devotees but those who claim to be the devotees of my devotees there my devotees dropping that one nice thank thank you so he'll probably say is bathing in the Ganges and serving a bystander also known as to Deanna opossum positive means to get close but it also has a word used to mean to worship the honor to Worship in your mind you're hard to get close to Diya Hai Sanam & immuno bathe in the Ganges how is that part of Saving it because it's all coming from the feet of Lord Vishnu worshipping mother ganga awesome and a devotee will they're they're located at the feet of Lord Vishnu or did they do the holy downs and checking out your voice
 I'm trying I'm trying to get in the mood but these holy places are the places where the Lord's feet have touched also you know so I think you know it's all related that he says this is also part of save them
Port Adia means in relationship with the Lord service to the vice number to the talasi plant to the Ganges River and the emunah are all are they are all all of them are included in Pata saving them all these processes a pot of saving them help one excuse me help on to advance in spiritual life very quickly
 very good nice with the archon of the deity worshipped but after pot of Seventeen comes the process of Arch Enemy worship of the deity has you interested in the property over the whole thing like I just took a little excirts okay cuz otherwise I'll take a very long time
 so now what should I read the upstarts oh oh you got the excerpts okay you made it except you guys in a very long time so here's some
points probably makes if one is interested in the process of archman again that means like the the temple worship where there's a carved form of the Lord as it as a manifestation of the Lord and is an object of meditation if one of us everywhere why do I have to worship God in the temple because he's easier for you to focus on there you go that's the answer by practicing seeing him in the temple then when you go out you'll see him everywhere so if one is interested in the process of arch than one must positively take shelter of a bona fide Spirit remastered learn the process from him it's a serious ritual that it is a science you know you have to learn
 for the householder devotees married people in living the home the worship of the deed is compulsory in our Krishna Consciousness movement there are brahmacharya grihastha Savannah presses Anthony Aziz
 but the deed
Worship in the temple should be performed especially by the householders and other end and I have this realization problem I had this realization because me and Mary were doing some shopping and the shopping involved except for the deity you know and I was thinking and I was seeing myself this is why they say
 DD worship is for householders because you're engaging your senses your senses one consume in one since it was at the freedom to do it as a house right you know but but but deity worshipped it takes time and energy and thought and it engages that which could be out consuming things for sense gratification Negra what is the deity need what is it
 it makes so much sense it's taking my energy my thoughts my resources to take care of a deed in them people so will you just fabricating this whole thing we're not this is this is why
the science how to purify yourself because you're a grihastha you naturally are giving yourself some license for sense gratification for being off the lease for being out there in the world and now you have these duties to take care of a DD in your home and that's part of the quote Decor it's not really Decor but as your husband wants to decorate their house a big part of it is well the deities the center of my house how can I decorate the deity How can I
 you don't recognize what's related to exactly what you're saying today is that studying something today it really had to do was like you know the Predator all philosophical question about the problem of evil yeah like why is there so much pain in the world of God is in control and God is good in all of that and I saw an interesting answer to it but it related to like this is like saying it's not it's not dumb
 it's not abusive
Christian to give us free will that's that's like a benediction that we have free will right and end it is necessary cuz if there's going to be loved it has to come freely
 but the problem is how we use it
 take some responsibility world please he has so we have this degree of Freedom what's your kidnapped
 oh don't worry about that. Just to hold on and I'm trying to pay you but my how are you responsible baby at Maps up in your previous life being kidnapped for your for your palate yeah I know if my kielbasa
 I was killing for kielbasa so listen to me
so the point is that there has to be some where we are on to logically dependent on that Source on Krishna
 and we we experience our fulfillment in his service that's the design of the universe
 but that's not like an abusive thing it's just the nature of realities how reality works
 but here's the thing
 someone could say why can't Christians just create a reality where I can be happy without him
 like why why why these lessons what why can't I just be happy without Christian you're saying that if I try to live separately from Chris and I begin to feel some pinch
 why couldn't he have just set up the world will be happy without him but the idea is that someone
 has to be the center of it all otherwise there's no Harmony otherwise you just have everybody
seating for the individual Pleasures so the university set up in a beautiful way we're like that being who has unlimited energies you know that expand in so many varieties of ways including us and including our bodies including our circumstances that one being is ready to reciprocate with us and satisfy us and provide for us in the most
 absolutely satisfying ways but there has to be some Center to otherwise there's a there's no Harmony otherwise everyone is a sing competition trying to dominate one another because of our selfish desires and so it's a perfect system and it's designed in a way where you participate and if you want and if you don't you don't have to but then it's designed in such a way to kind of like educate you to the benefit that's there for you if you just accept this blessing and you know it is a beautiful blessing
so what you say makes it make by the way it makes sense if the soul is eternal and we understand that everything we're getting some reaction from something we've done and we hate to think of that no no I know myself I would never do that yes you would yes
 got it take full responsibility and accept that you are a whole different being in your previous life and even in this life we were oblivious or obtuse were short-sighted and where myopic calls people you have a whole previous history of lifetimes of ridiculous activities and you're trying to say why I've been good person it makes no you're not all deposit no you're not you made a lot of stupid choices in this lifetime and many other lifetimes and the whole thing of keep a positive attitude or you know I forgive your enemies are you know or
like it's not fair you know where you going to turtle
 right because I'm saying like his room today he has an oil filter since been with his alter I've been with his alter a man like that the the devotion is often in the details sure it's very special every there's a story to tell about each DTE Museum it's almost like yeah. Like you see me is everything sorted dad all this is ancient this is ancient his like ancient but like alive and so you know you
walk in there and because his Center is the same as my Center which is Krishna we harmonize with each other when he brings me like someone may bring you you know people
 do you want to have a nice apartment a nice house cuz they can bring guests over to press them right in the middle person about their ego and then another person comes in and looks at the house at all wow this is really nice but it's thinking I don't need this for my house I would never I would never have done this in blue blue because they both established themselves as a center there's no Harmony now so this archana this worship of the DD the ideas it's a very practical way of engaging all that stuff is exactly you're saying when we be using all that detailed thought
 to put ourselves in a center but when you make that DD in your home to Center the home then all that detail thought goes into making Christian the center and that's where the harmony comes.
when everything starts to flow smoothly you know there was that movie that Tom made which beautiful movie but in at the end dimension of girl asked you a question like she was in the Krishna balaram Temple and and from her mind you sing will this is beautiful everyone's Chandon hundreds of people you're chanting and dancing and in this Temple
 a better question that something you would like but why do you have to have the DVD the question was that's how the movie and Grill all day but my point was because that's why we have to do it towards this doll these carvings if I'm so mad what I thought when I heard that was what it's because they've all put Christian Center in this is the ritual meditative scientific method for getting their minds
aligned with one another with around that Center that you have that beautiful Harmony there yet here is Fink's just said that's the best approach especially for greenhouses because brummell charged their young people that don't have any material opulence of their own processor people that are winding down life and letting go of everything and see if they have nothing so special glasses when you have a home when you have a job when you have money you have to begin so you have to do this ritual it keeps you focused in the right way so probably continues he said three has not let me jump in one second that you already know but if people don't know this is a good one if you throw up I don't they have balls in a pond all the Rings will hit each other with all the Pebbles land in the exact same place the Rings will never Collide so the idea is you have one you go to the one that has Center the Lord
there's actual Harmony but as of today we are the center we like many many my sense of gratification is going to impede on your sense of gratification I'm going to draw the boundary line here you're going to try to cross that boundary you're going to go for this resource I'm going to try to take no no no that's my resource let's have a fight for that resource sir
 we don't need to do that you don't need to do okay so then probably continues through House of devotees however generally engage material activities and therefore if they do not take to DD worship their Falling Down is positively assured means following the rules regulations precisely it's a meditative
 practice that is a bunch of householders watching the show and the guys are these ancient sages who just
I figure out how to get the mind moving in that harmonious wet
 do you wish me to call the roofer size that will keep on steady and devotion service Bahasa devotees must adopt the archon of e d or do you worship according to the suitable arrangements and directions given by the spiritual Master regarding those unable to take to the DD Worship in the temple there's the following statement from the ugly piranhas any household her devotees circumstantially unable to worship DD must at least see the DT worship and in this way he made Chief success also my visit tv.com remind me to watch the Puja going on the special purpose of DD worship is to keep oneself always this is important is to keep oneself always pure and clean right because the deed is in the center of the house and the house has to be clean
he doesn't help with that I understand his own dog like way the place up yeah that's how he keeps things clean is a different duties of this world has different duties a special purpose of the DD where she was cute ones have always pure and clean your house it'll should be actual examples of cleanliness observing the various types of festivals this is important why are you two looking at each other I got a lot of work to lift the standard up or get out of big mouth mirror today and I saw a Tibetan scrub myself now the Rugrats when I got home from that it having my head in that Calcutta motorcycle helmet with a helmet how many how many greasy coconut oil
Calcutta heads at the observing the various types of festivals such as she janmastmi the birth of Krishna ROM another me the birth of Lord ROM and nursing Hutch a tour to see the birth of Lord Rama these are also included in the process of DD worship to this way everyone can participate in other words it is compulsory
 for household of devotees to observe these festivals
 important
 it's kind of like Sinnoh Krishna I want I love you I want to love you was my birthday you didn't even come
 it's my birthday do you need me come day after my birthday is not my birthday Mom I would say it was saying that we should
say the digging for water analogy
 digging for water did this close to the question that you brought up early rugged look what God is everywhere then why can't we just do that the analogy trouble it's whatever you are is that the one where it's like
 that the well water is way down in the okay so realization of the park mountain in the heart it's kind of like
 it's not easy to find out in your own heart you know that that takes a lot of digging it's kind of like digging a well a well as dtd2 digging a well is like almost inconceivable how to do what you know you got to dig and dig and dig and dig and dig their way as they did in the old ways for a divining Rod I have a guy up here that still use the divining Rod of course of course it's thing
I know I know we're going to I'm with you have abused I've usually very successfully but a pond at Lake that's right there on the surface of waters right there on the service it's simple it's clear you can connect with the water immediately and that's what it's like to walk into a temple it's hard to find God in your heart but God is right there and you can bring your mind your senses all in focus on it so that's that's a large part of us one last point that probably made about
 archon of the DD worship pieces in the process of worshipping the DD is sometimes enjoying that one worship the DD within the mind
 so like I said yeah see you know we're not see who doesn't have a home and doesn't have money he may just do the same exact ritual
 without the actual physical D there cuz that Daddy could be present it said you can make the DD out of metal out of wood
how to Stone it could be painted excetera excetera and it'll can also be in the mind made out of the stuff of the mind and you can meditate on the TV and the story let's see what he says in the process of worshipping the deed you said it is sometimes I joined that one worship the DD within the within the mind in the Padma purana uttarakhand it is said all persons can generally worship within the mind the gout in the gout Tamiya Tundra says person you see who has no home wish I was the DD within the mind is recommended and in the nard upon charitra it is stated by Lorde Narayan that worship of the DD within the mind is called Mara Mara saputra
 one can become free from the four miseries by this method sometimes worship from the mine
can be independently executed according to the instructions of Xavier hotra Mooney
 one of the Nabi again dress as mentioned it she went by with some one may worship the DD by chanting all the muncher has eight kinds of Deedee's are mentioned in the shastra and the mental. He's one of them in this regard the following description so I didn't include that but there's a description and given in the prime of Ivar to piranha do you know what that is from the deities made of know of someone doing - A Puja
 that Brahma know who's making sweet rice oh yeah yeah and he's stirring the sweet rice and goes to Taco he stopped making it he's doing it all himself and he's a little tired
find she's meditating that is making this pot of sweet rice you're cooking on the milk if it takes a long time to put in the right ingredients doing it all and then you didn't want to offer until it'll cool down enough in his mind he touched it but when I touch it in his mind he felt the burning on his finger and it woke up and look at his finger was burned and then what happen
 and his external body and then he offered the sweet rice and an individual investor Duties are coming down with that are playing you know like this is a whole thing there is a constant ongoing thing as one story but there's a constant ongoing thing about how devotees are in some
 meditational State Medicaid meditation and their it actually manifest in their external world you know we were just reading about Nora Tom dust Accord touring about to charge in the same thing being in there deep meditation
service of Radha Rani and then all the sudden it manifests in this world there is also what the burn the burning of the hand or the other dangerous that can be dangerous if you're going into your meditation doing the meditation they get burned I just ate a glove jumping and now I'm feel very satisfied can't that happen to my meditation why should always have to be some type of burning of third-degree burn okay its 7:04 we got it we got to wrap it then you have to meditate on an emergency Ward do you have any takeaways our spiritual life depends on our tenth of chanting
 yeah I got to we got to take it to the next level everyone don't wait as long as it took Raghu and I to figure this out
you know I think I've other times of our life we already had this figured out the mower covers up and bring it back to the hearing of the holy name and focused way distracted you know what that means lock up the phone that's the new rock on Ozzy's in a locker room during the job but you don't get it you don't get it you don't look at it you don't keep it near you lock it up write that one down lock it up lock it up I was last week's
