this be our fourth or fourth year will we skip the year the Year
 Chipotle
 well but we didn't do the show okay today is our fourth year anniversary of the show give me something you can't hear that cuz of these microphones but we have a group of live live people here around the globe and congratulations are still four years ago after long travel we made it here we settled in we've slept a little I just took a 20-minute nap feel good I'm going to special diet one day eat once a day when it's 2-hour window the two-hour window to eat once a day you can you can graze for 2
as much as you want and then it's over but let's face it I can't eat that it's like after I eat and can't eat anymore so she was just one meal a day it's good that you can digest Stone if you eat once a day I think so I think you said that young man young man young man
 you're still a young man thank you thank you I was leaving the 31st I was going through I was going through or Mara she just feels my emotions sometimes I'm incredibly high for no good reason and sometimes I'm like you don't say as we're driving away I said stop at the mailbox you open the mailbox I'm actually driving away driving away I got the very first copy of my book if you're listening if you're not watching this on YouTube resume
this is the yeah it was really very exciting Mara open at first cuz I was driving so I can. There's a punk and there's the Monk on the back yeah get it pumpkin monk see how that works so I know it's like a nice if I tell you Monday they make nice quality but always oh no it's got a whole bunch of pictures in the middle really happy happy came out tell me some more about the book give us so so basically my story
 like I said I was like we want to hear your story I was like my story is not that interesting it's like I never was never did drugs I was never in prison you know no felonies had murdered anybody usually sounds like a recovery story like I just got was Messi when he did this and it was better and there's like a beautiful Ark I was just sort of like I was straight and they're like it and they said you know what it's a good story write it down and it's actually good because the audible
the audiobook it was it was actually very fun to read give us one then in a nutshell cuz you don't have a nugget today give us one lesson that came out of it life lesson
 think
 are there any life lessons you can choose your destiny by choosing who you associate with I don't have that come out in the book that come out well I wanted to choose Spirit over my material life even at that even at the cost of like Spirit was sort of sexy and cool and fun and and got into it and it being a hairy Krishna was like the most uncool if I said like I'm becoming a Tibetan Buddhist
that would have been maybe it might have been fun but it was it was definitely cooler and but we you and me became Hairy Christmas when they was like the most uncool thing to do you know there was not even know Christian or Community you know know it was now that imagine for most people I don't know they don't even know what to make of it but then it was like incredibly uncool but you know I prayed for truth my whole life I felt that my whole life but I think I was always on the spiritual path and I got to the point of ardently praying for truth and it's the package came and what can I do that except that I can you give me a different flavor of truth please God like so nicely in this Vedic Paradigm of reality and then once you're in at you like this is pretty cool very cool and and just and also we've met so many cool you know
if you don't know people just the whole thing just seems barn and weird and you might meet one person like okay I click with this person everybody else is nuts but then all the sudden the more you meet there's so many interesting people in the boxing community and it gets cooler and cooler and I will say now like 30 years later The Whole World's changing the whole world is changing and people are people are interested in the spiritual life and it is exciting because as the world is getting crazier there's also getting a very strong sobriety of people on a spiritual journey the people aren't very interested in a spiritual journey but we're doing is much less call T that it was it's just more accepting and open-minded and and there's real magic to be happy to be had
 that's how I feel I'm looking forward to reading the book and speaker magic we are going to give that one away aren't you going to get the Swami
put that up there you're not getting one you'll get one when it comes to Krishna I did I did I offered I put it on my altar I learned that from us while because he gave me the book he went to his Altar and he gave me the first journey home
 so that's what I did as soon as I got I need to put around the altar
 who sang I was going to say we're going to celebrate our wonderful laughter of of listeners by bring on such a listener so let's start with this young listener nundini grata
 Anthony Rother are you welcome are you really young or just really small
 I got to get Plex
into the microphone or else we won't pick up how old are going to be okay
 it's like they're real I think Social Work of the world I think that's like a big thing right now is like social work in like contributing to society but I think that this is what people really need right now so thank you thank you I paid for
 where you from
 you born and raised there
 okay so you are
 I guess your father move there first then your uncle followed is that right yes okay cuz your uncle Virgil boom he is one of our Sage group leaders in a great guy all around I think we have on the show on time I know I may have spoken about him on the show I think back when covid was kind of like
do taking off in New York and he was a doctor on the hospital but he's one of the nicest people I've ever met has very beautiful Temple there next to you do any safer there
 go to Temple every Sunday it was a great Community there what's your favorite thing to do at the temple
 keratin delete play libertango spinner very nice I'm glad you're having you here for just getting to know you
okay I'm glad you're here I got a question that you here for the whole show you're not going anywhere teenagers are you eating are you okay. Okay
 so do you go to a public school or private school around keep them away how do you deal with the pressures of just material material life and Teenage life you know I don't know girls to do I mean girls can be girls and they can get catty and and gang up on you and think you're a weirdo and what is it like for you in even whether it's Mara went to public spat private school she was she was tough she was a police
no but what's it like for you the girls accepting or is it is it nice as everybody boy boy crazy I think
 I think it's
 a bit crazy I think it changes though as people get older I'm in I'm in 10th Grade. So I'm a sophomore so will you definitely see that people have changed and I I definitely think it's hard right at the Democrats your social pressure is but I think one really grounding factor for me personally is definitely like my spiritual life who are you
 Desiree's 15 except like mud but shahria your friends at school to do they know what you're into the number to Hari Krishna day of the yoga thing I can do staying or however they see it have a little bit of like understanding
like maybe Hindu Hindu culture Indian culture but not specifically like Bucky or anything related to that but because it's a Catholic school you know if we have mass and things like that and so I will see the scores really like accepting of like other religions in other cultures and so I think it's easier for me to be able to connect a lot of like you know things that they do in Catholicism to Bussy and that's something that I also learned from Ron that's why me and that he's taught me a lot to do is to make those connections because whenever there is you know spirituality religion accessible to you anywhere is to take advantage of that and can draw those connections in any way that you can so yeah when you started doing okay we're giving you a big bump in your numbers here what's your podcast called podcast
like for the four of us podcast okay I like that and what's it what is it about
 like self development and just like I guess the personal journey I don't talk so much about busty but I guess I try to sneak sneak some lessons in their mouth about his new book once it comes out I would love to well that's beautiful thank you so much for your parents listen to a 20 ways a lot like when people come up to me and I listen to podcast everyday I was like you two are you okay thank you so much thank you so much
 thank you so much that was awesome we bought like a breath of fresh air on
do you know what meet Mira on our job walk today I interrupted our job a walk and we were talking about what we talked about like kids and second-generation devotees it's like it's not as devotees put kids who not just Indians but but Indians a lot of Indians and a lot of these second Generations third generations devotees and it just grow up with a bloodline a purity of Bloodlines Dharma bloodline of discipline a bloodline of like a true north and it's it's a man I can just see this world radically shifting when all these kids take power and they just become the new acharya's and end and it's going to it's going to change the face of this world don't be worried about this world falling apart in the war is here in the wars there and then and the corruption here and the dollars getting misspent there don't worry it will crumble but there's going to be a Charlie has to step in to leave the way and they're all
taking birth right now and it's quite exciting prophecy the Press podcast your family's Gujarati was it from the Piranhas was talking about like in South India is actually mentioned quite a few rivers on the banks of these Rivers people will be born at become very powerful influential spiritual remember that show we did what we read from the different Upon a Child in Paramus in the future and so what's the river in Gujarat
she will have her own podcast and from that podcast the world will be changed and I'm thinking like I done with my life like why wasn't I more focused that I couldn't have you know what I mean created your own weeks like cracks in my system and if I was only if it was a little bit more sealed up I could have done more that that feelings got running through me I appreciate it so I'm thinking all these people who are born into this world like that it created this thing from his desire and this is just one of the things he created with so many people working here employed here monks running the place then he's got so many other projects imagine that these young very empowered people start to come of age I'm serious and and and then they all have their own visions and there's
leading by example from birth maybe they grew up a little bit before they throw up it's going to happen it's all very and I also think people that have already been practicing our are passing away and then being born back in I think that's a real I think that's a real thing the devotees these early devotees who just died you know they're great songs but you know they made it to reach Perfection and they just died take birth boom then yeah maybe they got the option now do you want to go back and keep you out yet but I want to go back to where you want to go back and take birth in Houston Texas what's your favorite Indian cuisine
you get the darkest darkest darkest before the dawn is to say darkest before the dawn yes yes Charlie true but the statement applies in this case I really think it's going to be one of these eleventh hour things or things are going to fall apart and then stepping foot larger town is going to clear space right in the middle for the new set of hre is to walk right in and take the stage and you going to have to pick do you want to hell or do you want to walk with you Charlie has and you can have it it's going to be easy Choice some people that were addicted to hell they actually like hell did these are the people who are dying they have like one of those trigonometry in their throat cuz they can't breathe, trees stuck in her throat cuz I can't breathe because because they've been smoking their entire lives
for them if they Still Smoked they they figure once you're already there you might as well enjoy the cigarette but there's no enjoyment in the cigarette there's nothing there I just think people are addicted to your choices and it's hard I think our generation that this first generation of devotees who grew up loving sin you know what I mean it's like it it's hard to cut sent out of your life because once you've tasted that forbidden fruit beat whatever it is I'm going to begin don't like you went to Catholic School Sunday school is that what catechism
 and but anyway it once you take the taste that forbidden fruit it stays with the mind in the mind likes it and
am I want to indulge in other fruits and then then then we're in the process of boxes like okay I got to lose the taste for that you know and that becomes from any can that's the good thing you can't there's promise There's Hope for the dented cans of the world
 well I don't get involved with time and Weaver Weaver of yarny Weaver all right we have a body recovery group meetings today the men meet at noon the women meet at 2 p.m. and this Sunday on a Lowrance is offering his postural yoga class for the Patriot members at 10 a.m. eastern time

Janet has my age if I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are open my eyes with a torch light of knowledge and I forgot to pay since he's at their Lotus feet
 answer problem with you if you weren't born in the darkness of ignorance you were born already and Enlightenment synthesis
 you can't even say that I was born pretty pretty well I was born you know or at least close pictures great parents great family
 that's the denticare prayer in the dark and prayer I was born in the darkness of ignorance
 refinishing my pocket on Kanto 6 chapter 17 text Tony to what's going on but where are we it's been awhile New Year's Eve parties whites
 we have
just witness the cursing
 of March K2 and he said we got a chance to see how we responded to it and they respond pretty well yeah he was Paris by by Parvati and he got it was very happy person felt like it was externally if you just to judge it straight out of seem like it was too much but he didn't see that when he he he listed off like a whole bunch of horses that we read in the show 2 shows ago
 and there he said that he he was seeing he wasn't blaming her
 wasn't he was saying that
 do do do the world is working in such a way that Jeweler pasties that we're done we receive reactions for them and those reactions are all truly meant to help us grow Alba's develop so said why should I hold you responsible for what's coming my
it was it was maybe we could read a few of those were so just to refresh your door cuz cuz I know but we can just sit back a little bit let's see
 okay oh here we go again just started 17th and like your mother she's being very sarcastic with him and then she leveled a very serious kind of curse at him that he would take birth in the family of the asuras so she said my dear Mother with my own Golden Hands Together except that curse upon me I do not mind the curse. That's that statement there
 they were surprised that he said that Lord Shiva and Parvati were you don't mind at all I don't mind a curse for happiness in distress or given by the demigods as a result of like past Deeds deluded by ignorance the living entity wanders in the force of this material world enjoying happiness in distress
walking from his past Deeds everywhere and at all times they are for my dear Mother now either you or I am to blame for this incident in this mature World neither the living in see himself nor others are the cause of material happiness in distress because of the gross ignorance the living entity thinks that he and others in the cause this mature World resembles the waves of a consulate flowing river and this is what is a purse and what is a favor you know it's just like if you look at it if you look at waves like a river or ocean take the day like this one second and then they're gone so like is this good is the river good or bad you know it said where it is the changes in his world are they good or they bad they're just it's just what it's designed to do is to go up and down
 and so he's recognized I says therefore what is a curse and what is a favor he could with the right Vision he can see
curse is a favor or see if they risk our sakes you say sometimes I go it was good as bad as bad it's good it's good it's good happiness and what is actually just stress because the waves will constantly none of them has an eternal effect of Shifting right I've recognized as I've come I was you was in a great situation what she did
 threatened to kind of completely turned it upside down I'm expecting that to happen that's how this world works okay he says the Supreme personality got it is one unaffected by the conditions of the material world he creates all the conditions Souls by his own personal potency because of being contaminated by the material energy the living entities put into ignorance and listen to different conditions of bondage
timespy knowledge and living entities giving Liberation and suck the Goon and Rodger Goonies subject to happiness and distress the first thing that comes to mind is once there's radical responsibility for I got what I got now what you mean I'm no longer blaming anybody else not blame the circle the circumstance and they're playing the person I'm not blaming you know a time Factor my boss and a flaming anything but not blaming God I'm saying you know what I've got this obviously I got it it must have come from somewhere and I must be the reason I must be the result of it once you stop blaming you become at peace when you always find how did this happen to me this is so unfair dare they don't they understand why me who do they think they are we just live in this world of victimhood and we suffered tremendously and will again sometimes we carry that that narrative
forever and ever and we die bitter and angry and we never come to peace and Western therapy the good therapy you know they will take you to bring it to a point where the stable did you have some responsibility in this no I did not done nothing to you, but the yogis the yoga philosophy and Schnapps and armor we take it more seriously because in Western thought you can say well you know okay you have a broken marriage and your husband was an alcoholic who is a b c and d but you chose that husband don't know what was your responsibility so you can actually rational I said but sometimes you can't get to a place where you can rationalize that you can say well there's been some pain and abuse excetera when I was young and had nothing to do with that and I'll say well something happened in previous life
 something happened by the way that's a hard pill to swallow
but something happened to previous life and I'm getting some karma in this life
 and you still have to come to a point of acceptance and forgiveness to move on in this world or else you'll stay bitter forever so that's a true thing I think even Western therapy and you got it there's got to be acceptance this happen forgiveness you got to relinquish pain in your heart or you'll never heal from it but the bigger picture is there something that I had there's a hand I had and it's meant for my girl somehow it's been for my growth I mean I don't even get it or understand it it made pushed me so deep and so dark but in my deepest and darkest Ness
 we often times reached for God in it or it will we get darker and darker and darker showing in this in this
 and is thought of I can't get any darker than this so I can be suicidal sometimes
so traumatized you want to kill ourselves people reach for God and it becomes their Saving Grace will that pain and I think in his case in church because he was already fixed in that way it didn't matter what happens now you know that was he can he can he can you know bug of agita in the 6 chapter talks about it talks about the mind of a stronger you'll be like of a deep contemplatively meditator right that you know they're stronger Yogi's physiologically they're doing all kind of things you do in terms of Asana in terms of pranayama 22-game ultimately to gain control the mind and then they learn how to take the Mind into deeper and deeper states of concentration so so deep and so focus and so still that they begin to feel their own Eternal nature underneath in a way that you don't notice unless you get the money like still like
nobody is a different practice but that is you still experience the true nature of the self so Church of k2's done that in other ways he's done that through his through his reflection in a sprayer
 he said darshana Vishnu and he's got his face is like incredibly deep and strong at this point so he's feeling this kind of connection all the time and he's realizing I got it God your energies contact shifting I can't depend on it at all it is looks bright one day and it looks dark the next day I understand that that's how that works but I'm Eternal I'm connected to you eternally so really what's whatever is going on in the show of this world even when it looks like it's getting really dark from me because I'm heading out to you I know I'm secure and so even though he got this very externally very problematic disastrous kind of condemnation here
 he's entirely unfazed by and even Lord Shiva and Parvati herself will re today
I was like wow did you see that this is what this was about to yoga does for you this is really good that they were very impressed with it so why do we read on and I have to make a an add-on to my statement when we hear about the idea of radical responsibility and we're getting our Karma we never say that to anybody else if somebody else is going through some horrible pain
 it's not healthy for us to go you just get in your car if I do deal with it we don't do that if we're going through something you say it's our Karma you somebody else is going through something we say oh my God how can I help you what can I do for you how can I serve you or else we come off Callison Brash and and non empathetic so far south we can accept responsibility and four other people were very compassionate about the pain that will do one form of compassion is to speak these truths but it would have to be at a time in a circumstance where there cept
22
 especially Paris classes this year
 text Wendy 3222 person out of godhead is equally disposed towards all living entities therefore no one is very dear to him and no one is a great enemy for him I think we need to be clear about that too it's not that no one's dear he's like the dear friend of everyone who I think was being expressed as it's not he's not playing favorites favorites or at least I think it may be better because there are ways to become dear to Krishna but but
 everyone has the opportunity to become dear to him you know
 especially Dear No One Is his friend and no one is his
being unattached of the material world he has no affection for so-called happiness or hatred for so-called distress the two terms happiness and distress our relative since the Lord is always happy for him there's no question of this dress
 I look at Supreme Lord is on attached to our happiness and distress according to Karma and although no one is his enemy or favorite he creates Pious and Empires activities through the agency of his material potency out sourced as programs since the programs that are
 run by others but it's kind of just say programs plugged into the Matrix you know you really want it says highest and Empires activities is just talk about the law of karma yeah it is he's programmed into the world that their reactions according to how you act
 make sense
does the continuation of material for the continuation of the continuation of materialistic way of life he creates happiness and distress the good fortune and bad bondage and Liberation birth and death
 oh mother you are now unnecessarily angry but since all my happiness and distress are destined by my past activities I do not plead to be excused or relieved from your curse that's what we call the bargaining stage of the grief right right right I'll be good although what I have said is not wrong please let whatever you think is wrong be pardoned apologizing still
 she said they go swap meets and continued subdue of the enemy after sister Kay to satisfy Lord Shiva and his wife Parvati
 his wife Parvati he boarded his plane and left as they looked
when Lord Shiva and Parvati saw that your K2 although informed of the curse was unafraid they smiled being fully astonished by his behavior what is he
 Shiva and Parvati you're like who is this guy expected I suppose when you curse someone or you no deal some justice you want to see the person on their knee and I don't blame you I don't blame me I accept this fully pardon me you know that you know he was just in Tire Lee like he was he was as smooth as if she gave him a gift or something he saw it as a gift when you meet great devoted to get shocked yeah you do this when this young lady came on Michelle I was like expecting her to say
well I found myself grounded in spiritual life and become Shock by the words that come out of everybody's mouth it's not of this world

 play sex thereafter in the presence of the Great Sage Naruto the demons the inhabitants of cineloka and his personal Associates Lord Shiva was most powerful spoke to his wife Parvati while they all listened but does he say my beautiful Parvati have you seen the greatness of the Bison of us that's the Bucks of your lease at devotees of being Servants of the Servants of the Supreme personality of God had hurry they are all they are great souls and are not interested in any kind of material happiness Servants of the servants
 most people they shudder at the thought of being
servant
 here they want to be the servant of the servants at the AC Service in a whole different what I want to serve anybody can you give me some work no Kami of the servant they find joy and happiness Beauty satisfaction contentment in serving understood the nature of the South that were designed that way it's a beautiful thing
 in the end now comes a very famous first this this shows the result that shows how someone when they're fixed in that attitude of service and feeling a connection to God that's struck that their when their Consciousness is is fixed or focused in that way let the
we brought in the Gita earlier there it says that for the stronger Yogi when they when they when they reach that state of deep meditation they feel it a joy like I'm down to Joy with him that's so great that one they feel like there's nothing greater to Chief and in life and to that they can't be shaken under no matter what the external circumstances are now Church of K2 is in one of those are stronger you always this is speaking about in the 6 chapter the bug of agita he's achieved the same state but throughout the yoga is his is his love and Devotion to Vishnu that has him like this I'm always connect to Vishnu I know this external energy of his is always shifting so no matter how it shifts I'm fine nothing can shake me right and I feel like there could be nothing better that I can gain in life
 she burned in Parvati witness at and the like
text 28 devotees solely engage in bhakti devotional service of the Supreme personality of godhead Narayan never fear any condition of life no fear anxiety we can help you formula formula
 for them for them to have only planets Liberation and the hellish planets are all the same for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord nice this is Debbie you know this hurts you pregnant they were in there I never got to serve a Ryan up Saturday not cool I'll be to the Arctic Circle
 and Artemis value of a Sedar MacArthur, Moksha archana. She needs to see this
externally whether something seems great or seems not so good up until you are too dark and they see it equally because again they understand that's the nature of this material world is always shifting and they are connected in some way that so much deeper it's kind of like
 if you gain something so great that whatever is much less than that the Verizon what's in what's much less than that become insignificant to you cuz you have something so much greater so once you have that deep spiritual connection then the material ups and downs you don't, it is kind of like the bad and good or kind of the same you know better good are kind of the same it's almost like he was sometimes if you're free if you're out of the prison then good or bad within the prison is, you just see it all the same shit all you can get to book score you can get
this guy gets extra Jello in that guy doesn't it's like but but it's just like that all of that is just prison to you if you're if you're in the prison and it's all you know that Jell-O means a lot to you if you're out of the prison you're just like that's all this person right I seen all the same and so this is saying that so so Church of K2 is putting the circumstance work on the extra on the chair level he was flying high up in the higher planet and he just got shifted way down to the lower planets but for him he wouldn't even though he was high and on the material Level it wasn't that material thing that was giving him his joy in life it was his connection to the service and Ryan and so when he lost it
 didn't make any difference at all equally maybe we can really come to you
 Parvati is the commentary of 28 poverty might naturally have inquire
I hide the bodies become so exalted there for this first might is first explains that they are there I am simply dependent on Narayan they do not mind reverses in life because in the service of Narayan they have learned to tolerate whatever hardships there may be just a great way to look at life they do not care whether they are in heaven or in hell they simply engage in the service of the Lord this is their Excellence on a Kawana Krishna knew she lived there liberally engage in the service of the Lord and therefore they are excellent by using the words at the bottom of the servant that provided one example of tolerance and Excellence all the devotees have taken shelter of the Lord as Eternal servants are glorious they have no eagerness to be happy by being played
in the Heavenly plan it's becoming liberated or becoming one with broom on the Supreme of all Giants these benefits do not appeal to their minds are simply interested in giving direct service to the Lord
 you know almost like an exercise so we can perform it's just
 try to do this to try to do what your K2 did like wait attentively for the next time someone really does something
 to disturb you and then just respond in a way that's just totally outside of what they expected to be the opposite yeah just be like thank you for that okay and I just like you got a point there I am a kind of thing thank you very much thank you for finally roll down your window a big mistake thank you for
that out lately road rage situation it comes to your bangs on your window on your window I really apologize I'm all over the place. One sorry if I
 thank you for pointing out my shirt up and read it over and see what you want to hit me hit me worse much worse but but you'll see if you can do something like that you'll your you'll you will feel yourself Rising above it instantly Rising above sure the negative states of mind that you would have otherwise been subject to your going with their energy your near you know what is it the
 Aikido or something you know they're going for the punch and you're moving with the punch you know what I mean so they could go with the insult you would say take him down
you said that you don't go down yeah you don't want to go down there or else you got that's what road rage is
 all right
 2929 because of the actions of the Supreme large external energy the living entities are conditioned in contact with material bodies
 The Duality of happiness in distress birth and death curses and favors or natural by-products of this contact in the material world okay let's try this again so we got three examples of Duality but start with percent because of because of the actions of the Supreme Lord's external infant cereal energy the living entities are conditioned in contact with material bodies okay Brooke because we're trapped in with your body identified with material body we become subject to these two hours yeah it's almost like it's almost like if you put on a
the clothing if I was to put on a tuxedo right now and walk into the the prasada Mary where everyone's eating I'd carry myself in a dip with a different sense of self if I walk there in a policeman's out that I was walking he will be looking at me I'll be like walking a certain way if I walk there in a in a gown according to your outfit you take on a mental state of mind the outfit assist you to think of yourself like that we take birth in a particular body
 that also affects the way our mind is thinking of our self and so in this way you re are too because of the actions of the Supreme Lourdes Lourdes and I'll look it up in contact with a material body then that you wow these of happiness in distress birth and death curses and favors are all natural by
products of this contact in the material world no consistency was beyond the Bali conception is beyond the dualities and that was that was exemplified by his response to BBQs curse
 yeah
 text 30 x 30 x 1 mistakenly considers a flower Garland to be a snake or do that flower Garland like an old piece of hose
 is what is mistakenly considered a flower Garland to be a snake or Spirits happiness and distress in a dream so in the material world by lack of careful consideration we differentiate between happiness and distress considering one good and the other bad okay this is so true suppose you want one particular president to win
the election suppose you won't want anything and everybody loves his particular president any winds and everybody loves him but this President might be weakened another way where other other one might Rejoice thank God this guy one but it triggers some other Nation now we're going to attack This president's week you might be very sweet and loving but we're going to tack where is the president you don't want to win might be the one who intimidates more yeah so you think you wanted one way but then the opposite thing can happen right away you think that happiness is going to give you a happiness that happiness could give you the mostest what you know there's that store you do remember that story maybe it give me a hint it while it's it had to do with like
 there's some decided some Sade and like this is what he says could be at the store you had a baby
he's kind of considered how many congratulations I remember it was like he was kind of like the town side would like the local wise man and people come to ask questions about that serious questions about what they're going through in their life and he would always give this kind of response that just didn't really seem to address the nature they're there they had a certain they were attached to getting some kind of particular answer right I like tell me this is good or bad you know like like it had to do with seems all I know is I think it's a whole different ways but one of them was like the
 no no no one wanted him to had to do it like weird things are happening in the village like they're trying to like fire no one could like fire you don't know what time is it in such a dire wise man you know it's like we're trying to write for our what is this mean is
it it seems like such a bad thing with maybe it's better maybe it's good right that's what you do and so there was a series of things like that and then what happened eventually what one was letting fire I think I wanted like all the chickens die or sounds weird things right and they kept saying is this what kind of phone is this is it bad or is it good could be either bad or good you know and they were kind of disappointed and frustrated with them and eventually what happened was that they were assuming these real bad owns and what happened was at night these different Invaders came and they're taking over every village but when they came to the Village they didn't hear any chickens you know a rooster is crowing they didn't see any lights at night cuz it's okay so they just avoided them and it turned out to be good and so I suppose he's just trying to illustrate the idea that we kind of want to interpret external circumstances what is the presidential election in the not saying that we shouldn't all be
you know we we we have our own narrow narrow kind of way of analyzing the st. and N. Sometimes what a bad is good and sometimes but a good is bad but when you know already when you know already that this world is just constant going through bad good is constantly waves at up and down then it is not that you have to entirely abandoned try to operate as a force of good with in this world but you have an ability to transcend it even as you're living and working through it and so that's what bothers him so he's giving us and that's what your kids are just kind of demonstrated
