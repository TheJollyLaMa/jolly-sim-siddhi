 what if you wanted to mention that I'm going to be in Boston this weekend at Bridge 9 records at 2 that's Beverly Massachusetts and then I've got a yoga workshop at
 Back Bay Boston yoga Union so come join the temple is I think it's near
the temple is just on the other side of that Park it's kind of a very nice neighborhood there is where the temple is the president of that Temple Runner I believe that I don't think of me as a temple president to you
 I can handle it
 shoe and everybody out of Betty I loved it I didn't see your call I got the worst of all is a thankless task I wouldn't want to manage any sauce from there was a devoted their Prima Nunda and he really handled all of like the nitty-gritty kind of you know like crunching the numbers and just a lot of that management stuff he took off my he really took that off my place so I thank him he made it
is your task for me but in the end I still I think it wasn't what I was supposed to be doing well that's beautiful
 you dream your dream you had a dream and you were in the dream and it was one of these dreams I just woke up I was like you and you and Mark right now so I'm here in the front seat of a car and I was in the back seat of the car was moving and I was asking him how to make more advanced with a spiritual life and all these like esoteric spiritual books I should read should I bring this book should I read that book and then I should I learn to study Sanskrit how can I make more advanced my spiritual life and then he just started just smiling and then I just said or should I just embrace
humility instead of studying should I just Embrace humility and then he wasn't smiling then he smiled he said that's it because a few and Brace humility you can receive so much information and without it you don't get any that's a nugget nugget what a great dream because it because we get on this path of like I got to get smarter I got to learn this now you just have to empty the cup you got to empty the cup and to the beach humility is not meeting in this world we think it's self-deprecation I hate myself I'm solo know I've got to be more self-confident that's the know we flip flop between self-hatred and arrogance it's neither one of those things if I can get if I can start to understand I'm not
controller controller Universe if Ashley I am actually tiny part of something bigger and I can't get bold but not for my ego I can get bold in service of the Divine Right I can stick up for myself something wrong or being abusive toward stick up for myself but I don't do anything with more we can't do things in the sense of like I'm the master I'm the controller I'm doing this for my ego I'm not doing this to be God I'm doing this to serve God in that you do in that
 state of mind humility manifest not envious of other people's success not feeling sensitive when people are in pain you know
 how else would you help how has your picture of humor you know you were speaking and I just remembered that back sometime ago we discussed this
that I posted it on her Instagram so I just trying to pull it up right now that it's a tradition of humility but maybe we can come back to that cuz I might take me a little while to find it and thinking of yourself at once of yourself don't you go ahead and share that one and then I'll try to find this other one humility doesn't mean thinking less of yourself it means thinking of yourself I got it regular
 humility doesn't OK have the humility here and also not criticizing we're talkin about the critic yesterday right because sometimes you will hear this thing to say about humility means you shouldn't let people walk all over you or don't criticize just means you're not going to call out in Justice's or you don't know so we got to try to understand what is humility doesn't mean always acting Nique and being found exploitation it means freedom from the illusion that the world should be revolving around me
I like it okay and I'm not criticizing doesn't mean not correcting in justices and means not wasting time and energy and complaining and dwelling on the faults of others oh I like that too
 nice dream we're going to tell you about my did I ever tell you about the instruction I got from Prague pot energy
 are you trying to I just thought that I thought that was the one out time
 I got you about that we can we won't talk about that down another time if not we'll talk about another time I want to get into the Nugget but I did have a dream were probably just it was just like I saw him and I
I'm not going to paint the picture but not tell us the instructions he was he was in CBGB sitting on the stage and I walked in to see what you was with nobody in there just probably sitting on the stage you're interested I'm not going to tell her I want to leave it as a cliffhanger. Now I want to hear the dream come on all right
 Islam anything to do with what we're talking about or is it just because it's a dream no it's just a dream I have one hesitation when I say this because it may sound like the instruction was misogynistic but it was not at all I want to be very clear about that okay so I walked Indian 26 2nd Avenue is just like a block from cbgb's pretty interesting isn't it like these things are kind of like coming together you know
and I so I walked into cbgb's there's nobody in there not one person said she'll probably I saw you know how I have to walk down that long how it kind of have that like long entrance kind of where the bar is in the pool tables or whatever on the other side and you could like walk the dark in there it's got that floor that's like all chopped up here and so is exactly like that it was exactly as I remember but it's totally empty and I walked in there and prop out of sitting on the stage just alone I'm kind of real picture is there was like and I walked in I bow down to him and then I looked up to him and you just give me one instruction and then I woke up immediately like you're having that kind of humor Here Come the Boom and you wake up yeah so is like that this was a long time ago I was a brahmacharya this time I was a monk okay okay what do you say I down I looked up Papa looks like I said be very careful
 about associating with women
and then I woke up good good instruction for misogynistic you are Brahma sure that's what I think of people here that they might say all women are so bad he's well I think there's to be respectful you got to be very respectful yeah yeah yeah you know it'd be very respectful to women I took it that way and it also took to realize the the power that energy between the opposite sex is that it's got to be it is something to be careful with it something you know it's if you listen
 mind your p's and q's
 peas and queues okay that's a squirrel so anyway that was my dream was powerful and stayed with me all this time it was very what is it called when a dream is very rude feels very real
 lucid dreaming and Lucid but it wasn't just another word but you know I did had that it felt very real
 yeah
yeah might whenever I've had spiritual dreams like last night's it seems like it's almost another Bill Maher something a granny film like 16 mm this didn't feel like that this felt really like their you don't like real life but mine did too but it was kind of cinematic the way the whole thing was a young man he's had that dream not as good as I feel very blessed by that tree and was like wow you two all right are you sure you don't want to but I didn't meet you asked me to get back. Not like that Mom was very lucid and cinematic
higher quality cinematography you said it was grainy like okay
 oh yeah I need one up here and I had no intention to one-up you
 yes let's see your dream, I don't know we'll find out nugget nugget mean this nugget I just found this like it had no it didn't have it wasn't it didn't mention who said this rainy was it seemed like it was a Buddhist
 it's coming from like a Buddhist Facebook page or something like that but there's nobody is not credited to anyone and I honestly I edited it a bit just cuz I felt they could be so we should just say bye cuz it has anybody heard of
 are you ready I buy
and you know Rita slowly and one section at a time cuz we needed it is alive. It eats ants when a bird is a lot of details to whatever is dead ants eat the bird okay one tree makes a million matchsticks but one match is needed to burn a million trees only one match tree makes a million matchsticks but only one match stick is needed to burn a million trees
 Time Changes Everything circumstance can change at any moment any moment you can flip one minute the birds eating the the ants a moment later
 dancers in the bird you may be powerful today but remember time is more powerful than you I really remember this
you want to do some things with your body you know we going to take a running boating cycling do it now you might not be able to do it tomorrow I'm not sure that's the tickets like cotton and pursue your Monday and desire and if I don't think I don't think take care of your body's a Monday just as we move through life we should take care not to devalue or hurt anyone that's where I think this is going right not run out and do what you've always changed to get a check every entire block of the right in other words we're all moving to different circumstances in life and we have this weakness
 that any kind of sing any kind of opulence that we get any kind of power that we get we tend to become proud of it I mean
and then if you get and then we begin to see ourselves in relation to others based on that very temporary quality or empowerment that we have you know we look we look up maybe we feel a sense of inferiority towards others that are you know a billionaire can feel inferior and insignificant in the presence of some of that that's has more Millions than then you know and or we feel or you know a popper is proud of the penny I'd like it even if we have very little Oculus we still may look down on others that have still less
 but the fact is is a time is going to juggle the whole thing very soon like in any moment you know like the circumstances not only can they will change
 and they will see the external circumstances will change this is I'm a share this with you I'm not sure on the show before but I think what I think this is a real this is the kind of
you know like like proper gave us different analogies and within our Bucky Community there certain knowledge that just always been around forever you know like the bird in the cage you know like oh you take care the case but you're not taking care of the bird things like that you know but I always think I think this one could really be one of those classic ones who right cuz I think really spells things out with me just ask just picture if anyone since we don't have to paint your car too much cuz it will work well there's almost like this but like if we live in a society where your car the automobile was really like you got everywhere you went everywhere in the car and your car was real people really judge you based on the status of the car they do and they didn't let say was even more like it did the cars are even more dominant in our culture so is it was really about your car
 you know and and if that were the case
then you would it would be it would be likely like another WhatsApp you if the car was the first people things people looked at when they decided who you are and what you're worth was and what your values are you attractive are you powerful are you know they look at your car then the people with like that the high-end luxury automobiles would feel a sense of Pride and the people and they might only associate with other people that like had similar in in the same league you know cuz they only felt they were worthy and you know it has to be with them and their their their status is raised because I only associate with these people
 Adele they might look down sing class of people that had lesser cars and vice-versa the people in the Lesser car is my feels sense of inferiority or resentment towards the others Federer
 it might be tensions in society based on all of this and are there
be a lot of suffering you know that that's drives out of these Dynamics
 but imagine if you had the exact same thing but there was like this system or this rule nobody owned those cars they were all borrowed car and everybody switched cars every day comrade cuss tuba I don't know but imagine if every day you switch the car so like I might be driving the Mercedes or the Lexus today but I know and everybody else knows that tomorrow I might be driving the gremlin do pinto or whatever great, so then if that were the case what would that
due to all those Dynamics would like the pride and it's almost like you don't kind of feel that way but you kind of feel like there's that we'd all feel a sense of equality we wouldn't feel it you know that it would how would that is everyone real not only not only if that were happening but in a sense everyone would realize we are not these cars are status is not tied to these cars used cars or something that come and go very quickly and we all go through all the different cars will that's the case with the bodies you know these bodies or something that you know we feel a sense of Pride we feel a sense of of
 maybe sense of inferiority you no sense of Shame they Center bodies but the fact is is were trading them you know it may not be every day but within a short period of time we ship so like your bird one life and the next thing you're the ant what is the
most expensive are the nicest car I've ever driven driven driven that many cars
 I can say well I haven't driven that many either but I did have a client who let me borrow their you know it was over $100,000
 Range Rover excited in you
 no I was completing ciety that was going to wreck it out they said I could use it to go upstate because my car is not working he said he had just be really careful it's like you know hundred $20,000 something super
 super pimped out and chill a little nervous little nervous and then all of a sudden identification as myself as the driver clicked in there is strong such a strong attachment to the vehicle when you're driving it that you take on the mood of the car
and then someone you know car is broken down. Look at this loser with this car and I'm in this car and you like truck drivers steak and how much of an ego extension your vehicle is or your car or your your beauty is his or your wealth is or your hair or appearance is or your physique is
 and it's not us at all and you can lose it any second you can step out of it if you can switch something like our finances can switch in a moment you would talk about like the economy's collapsing or before a hurricane hurricane Sandy comes and wipes out everything that you have her everything that every momento that you've ever had in your house or things that we take we take pride in our house and sure you can rebuild
it'll never be the same house as that house that was a generational house for us and in a moment these things that we've really identified with and thought of as our self and we say that just because
 it's all preparation if you don't think like this when these things do happen chronic disease or Scarface bank account or loss of our hair or all these things collapse of an economy or get thrown in prison or loss of our anyting disastrous it's as if we are dying and we're not and so it's almost like a preparation for reality when the material world which naturally prunes what we think we are it proves what we think we are I thought I was going to fix it off
 yeah and they
for as we move through life we should take care not to devalue or hurt anyone because whatever position there and we're going to be in next week so that's the lesson that's the last we got to be careful about other people as we move through this world yeah we really should we should really try to see beyond the body's really try to I'm just thinking about when you and I went through an ashram what are the biggest things for person of moving the awesomest you have to shave your head like a lot of people that like you're cutting off part of their a completely different now computer going to look at me different and I mean people are so expensive specially met women shave their heads when they had one beautiful hair we're the ones who have to like I did a beautiful sarees in a beautiful there princess and we have to look like a freak
yeah they upgraded tuft of hair in the back like well next time around we're going to be wearing the Shari's and there's nothing but a lot of people who aren't I mean you and I shaved her head because I was sort of a thing when we are growing up it wasn't so hard cuz we closed it so bad but they're certain people like when they shave their head it was like wow I have to become a whole different person and their attachment and then you have to analyze it like him again about yoga type of waves like what is your hair that you're so attached it's just a manifestation of your ego is just remember one brahmacharya older drama tricks with your attached to your crystallized stool growing out of your head
 brahmacharya bullies and that's what's going on
moving through the world with the sensitivity not to not to devalue others not to hurt anyone
 where they know we're all vulnerable vulnerable to the power of time whatever Oculus we have not even ours it's just something we're borrowing and that car is going to be taken from us tomorrow
 he also said a client let him drive a Bentley around the West Village and people just look at you differently like a car or whether you're a beautiful person people just looking at you giving them attention not nodding smiling at you try to get your you know what it and it can change
 can you show me stories kaszuba can you think of one here is it cuz scuba Hot Seat can you think of a story in the Krishna book where a person is very beautiful offense a person is not very beautiful and because of beta pay some price
 nurse that was very beautiful offended person that was not beautiful yeah yeah yeah it's on the tip of my tongue
I think about it was it in dwarka to take place into work I can't remember
 Ashton bakra I don't think Casablancas and the creature wasn't Christian Booker was in one of your comic books
 who made fun of somebody in the heavens and had to take birth an hour and effort for it okay
 someone's got to come and help us out that I'm going to help us out
 I do not know
 Nintendo Chandra see actually kill me osterbach or did you ask about her too but that's one of the Krishna book
 yeah but we shouldn't have a clue what we're talking about

 I cannot think it's this trivia questions killing me now
 but we're hearing about Augusta and M Guerra El it could be something like a gust you or or some kind of like yes something like that kind of fun of it and patch of hair half a mile going to wear like
 well what one of the the relatives of the devotees there he kind of like there was some government officer that was coming down in his case and then he started like imitating like that that it's that that
 start imitating the way he talked to the head like a little spasm or something like that
what happened with that I can't and then he was going to get killed like because he because he did that because he dared to do that and then all of the devotees were going to cheat on you saying you got to save him you know like everybody listens to you you know you got to save him and shoot your tenders like I'm not getting it I don't even want to tell her because I'm so forgetful of like the lesson and everything you do sounds like she has been really Colace everyday like hell.
 All right but there was one that was a good book I couldn't enjoy it
 tell me look that up here to Heaven who was looking up to heaven surgery who has lost in this you gotten lost I am lost text 35 Ravina punishment bog of time Cancel 7:00 7:30 provide learned in the womb
 he speaking to his little friends giving all these instructions he's described this whole path of bhakti
and now he's describing the symptoms that one feels when they're they're very Advanced about Tioga and it sounds all crazy it's amazing that these new guys practice bhakti yoga ago
 what are the body becomes like a person
 haunted by a ghost the serial he laughs and very loudly chance about the qualities of the Lord
 sometimes he sits super for meditation
 and he offers respect every living entity considering him like a devotee of considering him a devotee of the Lord so this is who we have to slow down what what is the picture that is paying a person looks a little crazy they've got all of these emotions and they're seeing God everywhere and they responded that they responded to some of that other people aren't seeing it's like other people aren't seeing not everywhere
like why is he laughing right now why is he crying right now you know why does he treat everybody as if you know there's some exalted person I care bound down every living being the bow down to the ants and around down here in this person seems to be crazy what's going on are they haunted by a ghost what's going on
 yeah this is what you're trying to say that Vision you know and vision of God everywhere otherwise I could just walk right by
 these are the janusek shoes in the eyes of knowledge might not even reach this stage right like this is now they're really on this level of Rocky they're really on this it is going to Chuck's Used to Be Like a very advanced level of seeing Through The Eyes of knowledge
 okay constantly
sing the soul and everyone but now like I'm seeing them all in relation to Krishna I'm seeing them as in a constantly breathing very heavily he becomes careless of social etiquette and loudly chance like a madman Hari Krishna Hari Krishna by Lorde o Master of the Universe this is part of anantapur Bill this is like me and you do you pull over to rest stop and he just walking around this be back Shannon really loud but you know he's like he's focused and Channing the Holy Name a live to public opinion, he becomes careless of social etiquette and chance very loudly like a madman who is this is something with this this this doesn't mean just like I don't care what it is but it means like I'm just kind of oblivious to the to the fact that I'm at
in a way that seems unusual
 I can understand that but what I'm trying to see what I'm trying to convey to you is if this is this is is one thing if I like if I calculate I'm saying you know what I'm going to go do this and I don't care how people respond and it's another thing if I'm oblivious you know if I'm so deeply absorbed in love of God I was I can't say that I was at this level of obliviousness know I never I have been hahahaha. That was your chance to hear you
 not now now listen I hear the point right now
 provides little friends or sitting there the hearing all this description right
enter Then they might be saying want to hold it
 what year did scribing doesn't sound like a deeply spiritual person to me like that sounds like a materialistic person isn't it the materialistic person that are crying and laughing all the time and you aren't that the spiritual people like sober and even minded under all circumstances sounds to me like these people are still materially attached
 not going to speak to that doubt
 x 36 you know what I think it was asked about her you feed listen for this is a dialogue I know but I'm I'm going back to just say what did I just say I was I was meditating on her okay that's previous conversation now what did I just say okay man I got it right Austin box she's taking credit for Austin Walker okay now what should I say right now
just so you can catch up with the rest of us go earlier or say it again now provide is describing he's giving this picture of spirituality like Advanced spirituality any saying this is what it looks like you're crying you're laughing your dancing and nobody understands you now the Colossus it'll friends who might be saying I thought spiritual people are like even minded in sober and peaceful and always were you know you know like what I thought that's what spirituality look like and I thought what you're describing sounds like totally materialistic you know that I'm emotionally attached and crying one minute and laughing the next up and down isn't that duality
 you know it isn't to Allie the cause of all of our suffering in life isn't isn't that kind of emotional roller coaster isn't that evidence of someone being illusion and being attached to the things of this world that are always changing I'm on what's going on here cuz I was going to speak to that text 36
the devotees then freed from all material contamination because he constantly thinks of the Lord's Past Times and because his mind and body have been converted to spiritual qualities
 because of his intense devotional service the ignorance material Consciousness and all kinds of material desires are completely burnt to ashes
 sound if this is the stage at which one can achieve shelter the Lord's Lotus feet thoughts are things
 okay bring in the spiritual consciousness as burns up the material mind yet the one that's very yes but it but as soon as I see her in your hair as soon as it comes back in the
very quickly she can come back. Keep it there you got to keep it there you got to keep it and that's our practice that's our son a keeping the Lord's Lotus feet in the mind you can just go you can't respond to my in a moment
 you couldn't one of the wandering senses could just drag you back to my not here can go somewhere the scents can go somewhere cool that's what second chapter go get the right just one of these the senses are so powerful just takes one of them to send you completely adrift
 I might get a new dog now listen. So so provide answer the point what was the question what was the doubt
 you are sad not sure I want to see if she's awake
play Duality like are they still caught up in the material world suffering from dualities how are these people spiritual now provides making a very clear listen the language that he's using he says mukhtasar must abandon her did this person that I'm describing this crying and laughing and dancing and singing and all of this they're free from all material bondage milk to some must have been on the Ellen would recognize pointed at an ear doctor Beach a new show the Seas material desires not even the material desires himself but right down to the seed in the speaks to what you were saying right on through saying that that you could you could just flip back at any second will hear it say on this level the Seas of the material desires of burnt
 so it's one thing if that's next level is that what that's what I'm trying to tell you
stop so is this is not I was I was trying to explain the entire picture premature stage you can be a really Krishna conscious you could be a 180 degrees I'm in my the next moment will that's the guy that's in the Cure town that doesn't care what people think but they're not on this day and then there's another thing we're on a whole nother level of obliviousness which you claim to have achieved a few minutes ago well it stay there while it's still have two and a half minutes I was there now so not listen to what it says here it says on the devotees free from all material contamination
 all that programming the mind all those balls conceptions about who I am and what I need to be happy
they're constantly thinking of the Lord's pastimes they're keeping their mind right there and because his mind and body have been converted to spiritual qualities now that's interesting right because it is in the body and the mind are they composed of material energy and isn't that isn't by definition isn't that matter isn't that temporary is what you're saying it's spiritual has been converted to spiritual and there's a very common and algae the proper uses again and again to explain this point and what would that analogy you rather than putting you on the electricity could either fries or burnt depending on how to utilize that's wasn't the one I was thinking of that is no I don't think that applies exactly to the in-service
 I mean that he uses to say on a broader never like that Christian is spiritual energy manifest as material energy and therefore it's all spiritual energy sold
okay but how do we look at the material energy and say oh it's been spiritualized what was analogy does he get for that
 I don't know where you're going, you've read this soon as I say I call you have course I'm not going to be led by your disappointment and it feel like you're never going to forget this once I said so you're going to have gained something cuz I've created this awkward awkward embarrassing situation and more embarrassing it is
 that's the more humiliating this is the more of that is going to stay with you so you for this lesson the iron Rod put into fire how could it escaped you when I actually said this on stage
so how do you use it on stage I said the exact thing as an iron Rod put in Fire put in the fire takes on the quality of the fire yes so we become like who we associate with
 okay
 yes what I said I mean that's similar here saying so it's not just that you take on qualities that are so bad boys saying is is that what's considered and categorized as material
 that device numbers that's the sages they say that even that material energy like your body becomes categorized as spiritual even though it's still made out of quote-unquote material energy and categorize as spiritual because it's engaged harmoniously with spiritual energy is acting
virtual in in that sense it is is vibrating just like spiritual energy and since it still has that quality like it's temporary and it's going to change and it's going to fall apart in that sense we could say it's materialise you like the body of the devotee but what but the decision to say let's look deeper this if it's moving in harmony if it's vibrating in harmony with the spiritual truth that everything is Christmas energy and everything worked everything works for Christmas pleasure excetera then in that sense it is spiritual an iron Rod is technically it's not fire but if it's your touch it you burn just like it is fire right so practically and it says maybe not what the what's the opposite of practically like in other words literally
 it may not be spiritual but practically it is spiritual
well that's kind of right you can kind of Miss applying that but it's okay it's up there on the balcony at the Bowery Ballroom hold it like the guys on The Muppets
 and there's like he's that's true cuz to his right on this so I can
 both of you screaming from the balcony you're looking up at me like this guy images on the following Tuesday afternoon that was a good show I was you know what a beautiful wonderful service there beautiful wonderful service
okay this is a great sex we're moving slow to the chapter just doing a couple versus European launch a little slower you are built
 what we were there. One of my kids Grace humility to be filled by Grewal, be bold and service of the Divine Bold and Beautiful YouTube
manifest when we try to serve God instead of being God find Freedom From The Illusion that the world revolves around you
 yeah but we still are a very good dream of an ugly tree and circumstances will change take care not to hurt anyone. I'm sorry if I've hurt you today I didn't hurt you but whatever
 understand we're only driving this Alexis for a day and then we got to flip over in the gremlin when you ended up front if you want from Alexis one day to Gremlin the next day would you be happy in that grandma would you like a cool grandma
 material
World naturally prunes what we think we are
 Prince Beth Dakota Gremlin I mean what would they think if someone fact-check me on that. I don't think they were back in the old days Gremlins were just sort of like I think maybe positive beings bring in spiritual consciousness to burn off the seeds and material desires or the sea Tallahassee
