 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages of a Leo the podcast with your host Rockin off and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York to Stewart house welcome to show everybody it's arranged marriage Tuesday this is the day that I pick random people from resume audience put them together for life they never met each other except over on Lima really excited tonight we're going to marry off 10 year old just kidding
 I don't even like it when you talk like that
 they did that every it alive reading Leo Tolstoy they talked about
arranged marriages are red in my grandparents had an arranged marriage that was my grandparents did it at 5 I mean they didn't move in together they do kind of like they would beat they just the idea was this will be your husband I mean one sense it makes life very simple simple dating in high school and mentioned the connection that you have you been together since you're like 5 I have to go to at least 11 hellish planets for the hell that I caused girls in high school where they don't want to hear that would everyone version of myself my wife when she was in India she had that Monday done on her hands you know it's like that they they make those designed it later when she was a kid
15 years ago some okay they put that on your hands and you know that they draw the designs on your hands and then you have to let it sit there for some time right like some hours and then you take it off in the marks of there and she said that when she got that on her hands if she felt like something subtle inside like that felt like was from a previous life that she was being married off to someone you know and that's like you know I can't imagine your wife part of Vedic cultural when she was sick last life she's British Braves in Sri Lanka but I could see her and she's very Indian lady like if I can generalize 500 million people but I could see her being married off married off
doing that to me now why is it reason why is it work reasonably well and figure that out why does ain't no sense why does it work reasonably well how you know what you're marrying people from your community you marry people from your community the parents know the parents it's like a it's like a whole cultural perspective it sounds very cruel and it's just like how no way am I going to my parents decide who I spend my life with stop listening to my parents said when I was 12 but from another perspective you looked at life in a different way
 they could easily look at our world and say what
 you know these people would go into bars at night time and get intoxicated to try to find them go up and how many daddy put strangers and you know psych what is show of hands of how many people have met their girlfriend boyfriend or spouse in a bar write that on the message board right now it like that doesn't seem like the place
brighten the lights to Party Source wife's husband works are you still with that person that work okay yeah Mike and Sue chimeres when did this kind of goes to what we talked about today because I think we just have crazy ideas based on movies and television and the romance and what love is what life is supposed to be what life in marriage is supposed to be and other civilizations they had different ideas ever may be a lot more for being a sober you know and maybe not necessarily so sober they were like sort of chaotic when you tell Hannah ballistic getting every culture I think there's something wrong with the way that we
thanks we did sort of like we're looking for the perfect puzzle piece like trying to find soulmate person to make me whole and complete together the good person that makes sense and that's the two of you work together learn to work and learn to love each other yeah or instead of like looking for mr. and mrs. right why not trying to become the person that the mr. and mrs. Wright would be looking for slip that her to be like this but I'm just going to be a mold pathetic self I got to work she will save me
 or some guys were looking for a rescuer complete me that kind of thing that type of thing
 all right. Let's not turn over Tamara recognize who you got the chat board going right now that you are fast and Bob got into a fight at a bar 3 days before he met his wife I met her with a half
and I know women love that big bruise man death gave him later registered a complaint at work really perhaps that he said he and his wife never dated
 living together now for 22 years they never dated was in a Range can we on mute him please and location of the charger when you were you were in the temple and your wife isn't Temple the subway the subway very romantic go on Grand Central Station not the pretty part of the subway
so she moved in the temple about eight months later and then I moved to Portland back to Portland to marry your student trick and I wrote my my spiritual Master saying I think this is a girl want to marry what do you think and he said we were all thinking the same thing that you guys should be together everybody so did he date even date you just married and I just took a trip to Portland Oregon and Lapine I did give her a ring at some point but it was already known that okay we're going to we're going towards marriage. So in other words it wasn't there was a period of time not exactly I don't it wasn't like you gave her a book and you married me to buy that book but will you marry me I tried I'm doing pretty good today why not try for marriage but there wasn't courting process right
okay so it was a whole lot of ice skating. But it's not like he went out to a bar looking for someone or some of that this point with the highest into the possibility of marriage was there from the very start that said yeah that's what we were exploring sure it started off with a marriage proposal
 will you marry me like like you would have married him that day if she would have said yes
 I said you know he wants to marry you what do you think I want to marry her you didn't know her you just met her at a subway we were the ones that were basically bringing her into the Consciousness that's the kids
anyways worked out one less success story we love success stories not write a great leave it there a place where you can let it go that was great
 Ian and Ali the how are you one of our favorite artists in all of the Harry Krishna movement how are you
 I'm good how are you you have an arranged marriage careful drug May propose for a second there is no going out and getting to know each other up a devotee okay and your husband but no know he was a little older and but he came into town to build a real house of cards
the old come to town to build a raft the yatra card trick to the temple president service and then and yeah but then leave a sort of the same thing he talks to his girls that I think I'm at my mom's and he asked me to go. I was wondering if your parents were concerned because he wasn't born and raised in a devoted family was at work that'll work or how many years how many years 525 wow
 that's pretty good who knows to you and I know he looks kind of like that too when I decided I was going to get married there there is a bunch of people that would like all we know just the person for you just
yeah was your other ones was there like there was one possibility of someone that I never met but it didn't really hit hardly got off the ground cuz you make you too. And people are saying quite a few people are saying all you do you have to make it to prayer cheese sweet stuff for the right person
 well if it makes some of you feel like less than hearing all these success stories that was with somebody for a long time we weren't married but we were together then I got married and that was everyone knows that story and anyway when driving Christian to come together in a romantic relationship it's called The Mad or yell Lila and so last of his arrival Swami he was asked me like whatever happened to that person you were with the first
and I said a lot of didn't work out and they said and they put his arm around me and he says rocking your entire adult life your entire material Lila has been a failure and cried at the
 it will always be a failure for trying to enjoy separately trying to rather be part of krishna's Lee like try to have our only lies all my romantic Affairs have been taking a Valium
readings today the men meet at noon and the women meet at 2 p.m. eastern time and we have in person meetings in Nashville and Alachua through this arranged marriage thing I need to know is going to cut a boomerang it's coming back at him and start hitting me in the very similar to Harvest Moon he throwing that fireball and I'm buried them back in chasing me
 all right we got a nugget today right now I finally get into that nugget
 okay this is what you want to read it because you
 read this one please today's nugget is coming from one of your favorites and mine the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy regarding Anna Karina right now they're young I said reading I mean listening to the audio book while mowing the lawn and when you say listening to the audio book by mowing the lawn you say you're mean it's kind of playing in the back
I'm not reading it and pushing a lawnmower not exactly hearing it what's it about
 it's about a Russian Aristocrat and then falling in love falling in love and his family is intermingling and you are very attentively hearing it okay yeah he's regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time running. But he was a deeply spiritual person that's why we relate to him he was reading bug of agita
 you know he was having some back and forth with Gandhi you know it's like God yeah letter exchanges yeah yeah yeah
 he says joy can only be real by they might be false kinds of joy and so on illusory Joy perhaps artificial Joy by Joy
I can only be real if people look upon their life as a service it have a definite object in life outside themselves and their personal happiness see this all the time he's right on he should you should send this to he should send this to iskcon people get people going to be in the religious institutions in the religious institution is going to save me no one's here to save you we got to save herself and part of Saving ourselves means engaging what are gifts are we all have some type of gift we have a gift and we have to figure out how to use that gift as an offering is super simple how to use my gift as an offering and I should be excited to wake up this is the day I'm going to use this gift again this is my plan for how to use this gift in the future this is where I want to be 10 years from now with my gifts first of all we have to recognize we have a gift and second of all we have to do
games are we have to engage in our gift as an offering not just that we use our gift to our own self promotion
 but but it's 4 or to endorse my ego or to give me a type of validation because I feel empty but it has to be a contributory offering and it makes us feel part of something bigger because in reality we are part of something bigger we are little satellites around the big globe of Lord Vishnu you know and we are we are we have no real reality substance Joy when we try to artificially separate ourselves from God or our source is that the criticism I used to get like when it we did shelter when in the very beginning people used to say why are you putting. In Punk doesn't belong in the punk about God how your power source that's been the fee
name of music for the history of Music practically speaking doing something artificial by putting God back in music we are at we are going back to the source of music and including that we are part of something much greater than ourselves we are we are not independent we can't we can't enjoy the resources of this world and pretend that the world has no Creator it's like me break into apartment your apartment using all your spices all your rice all your doll and when you come home you like what the heck just happened my apartment and I just ignoring that you're a possessor of your little Maid of a little bit of a mess of it and you know what it's okay and this is what we do it's sort of like we claim these resources as ours we were here first we're going to take over this week country make some alliance with this where can I extract all these resources and we're just thinking of it's just like a land grab that's what we do in the material world that's what we do with this environment we don't
this planet is Forest these mountains these in a water tables the ocean we don't believe it's God we just think it's a land grab and who whoever can get it first they win and they will extend it makes one that's making a mess so to speak of your apartment is it's Me First and the Gimme Gimmes
 thank you again I see it you know I find it interesting how he phrases Joy can only be real
 so it seems like he's he's saying that it's not that people don't drive Joy through selfish Endeavor but that Joy is not actually what the people that are vibrating on the higher-level are experiencing that's something else you the real Joy comes in a different way and then it's a very consistent idea with what starts in bhakti yoga right now we're not exactly saying that there's no happiness in this world but that
happiness is not the same it's not of the same quality it has all kinds of limitations and all kinds of drawbacks that material so call Joy so-called happiness and it has to do with design right that like by Design we've been designed to function in a particular way and that way is and this is a good thing this is a really good this is really good news that we are all designed
 with the idea to serve the center of existence if we can do that then the great news about that is that if we choose to do that then life becomes very harmonious the problem with it being the other way hold on right now if you can if this was like a 3D screen where you can just shove an apple in my mouth
Ethan is the problem with if if everything were designed the other way if if we found our joy and fulfillment
 in selfishness that is a recipe for keto. Because nobody's going to work, and that's kind of what we have in this world and even when we get the so-called Joy it's not satisfying it kind of like the flavors very soon disappear as a kind of
 book Warwick were kind of left feeling empty tolstoy's point he's a deeply spiritual person he's pointing to something else he speaking to something that's intrinsic within us it's it's good realization we don't want some fun we want a lifestyle of evolution all right we don't we don't get some
we went we went to the Caribbean Whoopi right we got a new expensive mountain bike Whoopi you know we have the power has Whoopi Whoopi it's just a combination of Whoopi's together know our life is a progressive path where we can move we don't even have to travel all over the world it doesn't happen to have we have to put our foot on every continent or have some Wanderlust burning within me if we get it right you can be in one place forever except boring do the same thing but feel like I'm progressing I know hurting I'm going deeper
 you don't chew properly always spoke he spoke this phrase which sounds unrealistic he says you know we have to fill our day up in such a way design your day in such a way I know you're engaged and service 24 hours a day lover you know there's so much depression
confusing so it's just because we want that fantasy and we think and whatever kind of little piece of that we do find in life if the taste of it quickly goes away and we're left feeling empty again but if we have a life full of day I just had that cut out a day from beginning to end make it service you caught those kind of like a health is kind of like the material enjoyment is just like junk food you know like some super sickeningly sweet junk food and the life of service is like this nourishing meal you know it's like it's satisfying and nursing at the same time
 I recently got a message from someone riding in and they said yeah I wonder if I had any natural cures for depression the doctors are recommending I go on some medication I said I am no doctor or psychiatrist I can help you but let me ask you a question
do you like your work because now I've got the worst job ever I I do this at work for this man who just six exploiting people I was like well maybe that you should ask a question like if you're not doing what you love to do or if you're not feel like you're contributing to something bigger maybe before you medicate you're paying maybe you should just like shine some light on that right find out what you find out how you can contribute in this world where you actually feel satisfied instead of of course you could have to be to press it natural that is like the red light in the car saying it's time to turn off the gas you're out of gas right now time to fill up the gas you're not going to get a gun can I get a screwdriver bang that light out and that's going to make the now I don't see that light anymore yeah but you're supposed to run out of gas you just take that medication you said to be sad why could you not doing what you feel like your heart is born to do
 100 wisdom of the sages listeners when off the medication that day I created
there has been multiple lawsuits brought against this I didn't say it he said your honor my client did clarify that he was not a psychiatrist or therapist but this we found in this other episode where he said I'm kind of a part-time psychiatrist
 okay are you ready by the time which is not very means of Conquest when should I be respectful of basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to Nardin trying to reach you the super most human being into mother saraswathi the goddess of learning disability office today
now stop right here is about race Unity oh okay back to your regular classes the bog of time by rendering service to the Peterbilt he's all that is troublesome the heart would become erratic hated and loved you service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with Transit Idol songs will be established as in a revocable fact
 only gal, Dundas Yaga
 I was born the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes or the torch light of knowledge I have no base and see if he's at the Lotus feet I don't care what is I'm doing a book signing in Detroit at the batemans hardcore festival and then go to the Epix lanty lanty Harmony
Collective a little is that how you pronounce it if it's not I think I don't know major Miss 20 maybe do a program there maybe try to figure that out that's Jus June 2nd in that area
 right on. Is she my bubblegum k-27 chapter 9 text 24 little prolonged speaking
 little prayer lied he's been giving us the his his unique perspective right the oxidative so all three of all the baited literature's in The Bob & Tom has shared with us the perspective of prolonged for particular purpose right here's a little person that seen materialism at its highest level close up if we had any inkling that the problem is a material is in the promise that I just haven't taken it to high enough level yet
 he saying no
seen it on the highest level I seen a person took over the Universe I seen a person that conquered all apparent enemies that had unlimited wealth and power and Prestige and so on so forth and I saw it all I saw how he was miserable
 and I saw how it all crashed in a second time just crushed it Crash and Burn and so he's praying to the Lord Vishnu in the form of the half man half line and he saying I've seen it all now I don't have any interested in all of that there's something more important to something more real that I'm looking for
 and so now we get to hear what it is what if you're not interested in material power and Prestige and wealth Fame cetera what are you interested in a little bit a lot what what is it that you want
 now I have complete experience concerning the worldly opulence Mystic powers
longevity and other material Pleasures enjoyed by all living entities from Lord Vermont down to the ant the complete experience he seen it at its highest level the ants even had pleasure they got the power they got Prestige they got a big chunk of sugar but my dear as powerful time you destroy them all there for right God comes in the form of time Carlos me look soil creep rabbit hole
 therefore because of my experience I do not wish to possess them okay what do you want what do you want material my dear Lord I request you to place me in touch with your pure devotee and let me serve him as a sincere servant put me in touch with your peer devotees let me Sergio's is since your servant different than the prayers I was saying yesterday I was
how I grew up rain and Chris tuba shaver never fully admitted that he never prayed in the mara never played Mary Mary's atheistic scholarly family never prayed
 but I prayed but I pray for Stuff big deal I was just talking to a spiritual materialist
 here this is a different thing this is praying and appreciation in glorification in desire to serve and the interesting thing happens is when you're the person that actually just wants to give love back and you can imagine a child let's take this macrovision and looking into a family of micro brasion like little Fibonacci spiral thing here that when you have a child that is saying mom give you this Dad give me this Mom can I borrow this dad let me twenty bucks but the parents just like all right here you go here you go here you go he's approaching that higher power for stuff and the parent is just doing it
eventually the parrot is sort of enabling and sometimes he spends the money on alcohol the kid teenager what about the child that says mom I want to clean the house I'm going to Mom I got this my mommy you need some medication let me take you to the doctor mom there's so much loving and affection for that parent the mother naturally gives the child everything what do you want what you need to use the car for something to take the car fully trust you there's so much trust from that your rentalsource to the child that the child gets whatever they want without asking in the asking we're almost pushing away all of our benedictions but in the serving we are getting everything showered upon us and that's why we find the part of my humps are the pure devotee all they want to service and they actually have everything and making up nothing or everything and they have everything they have on Mystic Powers they are full and they have full Bliss and that's really
I want to hear your thoughts I'm sure so we heard from tulse toy and he got this idea that service is really what it's all about right it's when you're trying to serve others that really the true joy in life comes about to go in and I think a lot of great Souls have come to that realization how did you know I just looked up quote about service and I just lose a whole slew them it really good quotes you know you had Mother Teresa Martin Luther King toast or you had rabindranath tagore goes on and on and on and they're really all nice quotes but there's something in this quote that's taken to another level that Pilates into saying
 dear Lord I don't want all these kind of material benedictions that you're capable
I just want to serve you that's not exactly what he said what he said was I want to serve your servant
 right he said he kind of
 made it like a
 exponentially one at least one stage removed all right he said I did not even directly do I want to serve you
 I want to serve the one that serves you
 and that did this this adasi on a dice or at the servant of the servant is an idea that's that's shared spoken on a lot in the bucket shastra the text of lombok see why is that important this serving the servant
 are you starting over
 whenever you're ready cuz you just what do you think about this
we are on experience from your own life
 have you ever serve the servant
 in serving the serpent
 there ain't ever got hit
 how are you want me to get it started get this ball started get this ball started. You're going to run you know what I was doing I thought you were just going to grab that ball and run with you know what you said something earlier cuz I got to research this now and I've got some really good research oh okay what was that about what it would do your thing first going to bring it in if it's not my thing or not I'm just going to buy what time do you're just wait for me to work with me okay and then we'll go do your thing
 okay show me the servant you know why
 anime
esoteric levels of Bucky this is spoken of right and they will speak about that in a second but a lot of times thinking of a plant you know within the the micro we understand the macro right when we look at a plant you'll have the root of the of the plant which is nourishing the entire plan and then you'll have like a like a branch or like a a Vine in a long that vine will be leaves
 and it's not that the leaf at the end is less nurse than the ones in between or closer to the route that you know the in the entire plant is nursed when the whole point is to be connected right that's it just to be connected and through serving the servant it's it's it's the most practical and realistic way to be connected to God right like I might think all I'm connect you know
my idea of how I'm connected to God may be very theoretical you know but when I serve the servant it's become very immediate and very real and you know it's sad that because the servant of God because of the volume God is so dear to God that this is a nature God has his he's fucked about selling his heart is just it's just all about connecting to those that love him
 and when what went dead so when one does Love and 11 does serve him with love they become so dear to him it said that even dear to him is those that serve those that are serving right at the spot where my heart lies the most you know I'm in the heart of my devoted he says it's it's such a such a strong connection when one serves the sermon on that most esoteric level like when we hear about Krishna in Vern.
being served by the gopis write these beautiful Celestial in one sense they're just cowards Grossman other since they're like the Supreme goddesses
 and they all have you know there's a there's a Krishna and Radha
 and then they're all serve B eight more primary go piece right there just so I can make it this Inner Circle
 and each one of those a Kobe's they have servants called munjor he's like younger girls and the word mundri you know what my dream means
 what does it mean and loyal I mean I know where my drink at all reference I was like the little the little bud and okay flower right with that bad seeds come from God and you don't like when you see a flower like at alsea monjuri is those CLA grow out but then at the end of flowering yeah and like
but that's what I said you are smoking today and then suddenly I got you one question
 so it's so sad that when you look at a plant you know like if you shake the plant
 the flower Shake even more than the rest of the plant and even more stupid shakes even more than the flowers that little buds on the end of the flower there they're the they shake the most
 and it said in a similar way the munchies their hearts and their their experience is is like a still more than anyone else is even though they're indirectly serving radha-krishna they're serving radha-krishna through a servant of radha-krishna that it's not like they're their experience of divine love is even the tiniest bit less
 it's it's it's actually in some way could be said to be even more intense and since so for so many reasons
the devotees a desire to become the servant of the sermon sermon this is treated when he was dancing and the rocky Archer Parade route it were Christmas being pulled on on The Chariot and shoot you in the mood of rata
 is dancing and singing and crying in the in the deepest
 deepest
 realization of devotional love he sings this prayer
 that I'm not a Brahmin I'm not touch you I'm not a vice show not a soldier not a brand new charger has to have an impressive so you answer all of this social considerations they have nothing to do with me
 you know you can look if they know you are a senior that's the external level is not he's seen from that foundational platform not the function play Foundation I am none of these external cuz it what am I at the very core and he
Gopi Barta, your of of Krishna who's the lover the gopis...... I'm serving of the servant a Christian who is allowed to go because it's so it's so Krishna himself takes this girl that I want to be the servant of the servant of the servant and of course the converse is true the converse is when we offend Wilma Rudolph a cruel to a to a devotee it's the greatest defense we can do in general we treat everybody as a devotee we treat everybody but we find those who are really endeavoring towards bhakthi we really want to give render service to them but in general we we look at the people that God sends us in our life this is the metric for our spiritual life how do we relate to these people do we give them love because what's going on is we very easily in the beginning stages of baki feel like it's me and God
me and the deity we are connected this guy drives me crazy she drives me crazy my boss truck and once we start to relate to better metric for our spiritual evolution is how I treat the people that God puts in my life and somebody put some real Sour pusses in your life to make your day miserable how am I going to react to that
 right am I going to am I going to love people that it's easy to love people that look like me that's children do that because I love a person who's difficult cuz I love a person who is very difficult to love serve them you're the baby yeah yeah I love the person envious of
 how do I deal with that
 interesting. You know what we're talkin about
 death opulence the reversals of Life can happen any minute with all your Mystic Powers I was thinking about Steve Jobs
job has a job Steve Jobs Steve Jobs you know he actually fit when I fact-checked and I don't think these were actually his last words
 what do you want to pass word for crossword Krishna yet he had a lot of course I believe is a raw foodist
 he used to go to the temple in was it somewhere lost material things lost can be found but there is one thing that can never be found
lost that's your life life whichever stage in life we are right now with time we will face a day when that curtain comes down to whether we live in a half a 300 square-foot house for 3000 square foot house loneliness is the same
 you will realize your true inner happiness does not come from material things of this world at the stuff of this world
 therefore I hope you realize when you have mates buddies old friends brothers and sisters who you chat with laugh with talk with have kirtan with it says sing songs with talk about north south east west Heaven and Earth this is true happiness
 take you out and I was trying to go underneath the here's a guy who has everything pretty much at his fingertips and he's trying to like understand what is happiness and it's going more to
Cecil things which a pepper at the top of his priority here is relationships family laughing singing songs
 anyway I believe you had that much percentage probably go to look here, go to your town in there to escape into your time if you want that free Subs on the stage is probably the only place where you get spiritual stuff without the without God
 we did it backwards usually give up a job and needs it and then get my philosophy we get the philosophy purse we owe you guys plates of Rashad we are at the Archer come throughout the actual give it out and everybody coming to rob the ultra in New York bake cookies no eggs please make a batch cookies and offering to God with love and distribute them on the street at our little was Malaysia's table
52 let you want to keep this going yes it's so now prolonged saying I don't want all the things my father had I want to serve your servant that's where the real trouble, that's what I meant to do that's all I want now there's Dave may have said but everybody wants enjoyment in power and yet you are rejecting them how is that let's hear what he has to say and this material world every living entity desire some future happiness which is exactly like a mirage in the desert but not all desirey some future happiness like right now it's not good no it's gonna get good cuz I got over that look at over there where is the water in that desert there isn't any or in other words where is happiness in the material world
 as for the body what is its value
 it is merely a source of various diseases the so-called philosophy
scientists and politicians know this very well but nonetheless they expire for temporary happiness happiness is very difficult to obtain but because they are unable to control their senses they run after the so-called happiness of the material world and never come to the right conclusion it's a Rubik's Cube isn't it it's a real it's one of those six triangles which is even harder than the cube I think set so you know it can wait if we go right back to the beginning the show it is perhaps for most of us particularly when we're fed so many images and ideas of what enjoyment is and what happiness is it is a little bit counterintuitive to think it can be counterintuitive to think my happiness will come through service
 but you know there's a intuitive ideas happiness will come when I'm served it's counterintuitive to think
happiness will come when I really start to serve that's what I'm going to feel satisfaction that's what I'm going to feel complete that's what I'll feel hollow left when my life won't feel empty soap so now perladas going to say you know I want to serve you look how merciful you are too and he's going to knowledge the Lord's Mercy in this next verse text 26 x 26 oh my Lord oh Supreme because I was born in a family full of hellish material qualities of passion and ignorance what is my position what is to be said of your cause this Mercy which was never offered even to Lord Brahma Lord Shiva or the goddess of Fortune Lakshmi you never put your Lotus hand upon their heads but do you have put it up on mine but pause feeling of I don't deserve but you are giving me that attitude of gratitude changes the way you see the entire world open a lot
 unlike any other
it's beautiful though isn't it I mean because all those other David's are standing right there
 and here he is the son of a demon the one that just got wiped out with some of the demon and he puts a big hurry so you might have had hands did not know he had Claws N Paws and Nails sharp human feet yeah yeah tomorrow tomorrow you guys were going to do something special meditate on the Paw coming down on your head
 oh we should okay I got an idea I might any ordinary living entity my Lord you do not discriminate between friends and enemies the favorable and the unfavorable because for you there is no conception of higher and lower none the less you offer your benedictions according to the level of one service exactly as a desire tree
a fruits according to one's desires, makes no distinction between the lower and the higher in lineage
 you don't you're not like a lot of other people that like judge you according to your yeah yeah you're not partial like that's kind of where this Kanto began with a question about partiality in the in in in Lord Vishnu he sent you for sipra Kate if someone shows you even just a little bit of love you just bring it back and it doesn't matter who they are or what their circumstances are none of the externals matter to you at all you've accepted me even though apparently I'm someone qualified
 how do you know there's something nice that was 27 right let's 27 commentary
as stated by shoojit animal Harper bougie bear a group of Krishna Renita.
 Every living being is an eternal servant of Krishna according to the service the living energy renders he automatically receives benedictions from Krishna and does not make distinctions thinking here is a person in an intimate relationship with me and here's a person I dislike Christian advises everyone to surrender to him sarva Dharma and pretty ja mom a come shot in a relationship with the Supreme Lord is in proportion to that surrender and the service went to Render unto the Lord thoughts throughout the entire world the higher and lower positions of the living entities are selected by the living entities themselves we are in a sense choosing where we end up if one is inclined to dictate that the Lord grants something
 underseas benediction
according to his desires if one wants to be elevated to the Heavenly planetary systems that have any planets he can be promoted to the place he desires and if one wants to remain a hog or pig on earth the Lord fulfills that desire also there for what position is determined by one's desires Lord is not responsible for the higher or lower grades of our existence we are choosing
 where we end up to our desires or partial all comes out and then the bride on your head Runner
 one claw comes at their right in the Bog of time is 6 in writing
enlighten me no one is here to save you you have to save yourself
 recognize and engage her gift as an offering real Joy comes from a life of service to the lifestyle of evolution over some fun okay all right like that in service we get all benedictions all, including Mystic powers or I can read you a book to see it we talked a lot about desire trees Imagine One imagine a desire tree I want this I want this and I'm just think it's me I'm not saying it's the gullible I have to get stuff but I'm going to be fast and cool off the tree like a fruit with a statue that's what I was thinking
desire tree but if you want desire a tractor that grow off the tree is going to pick up my route that doesn't disappear grafting different fruit trees in One Tree so I can give him a cool one two routes super cool
 super cool it's could be considered Frankenstein as you're not going to make her a matter how do we relate to the sour pusses God sends to us yeah so sick of them we're all Desiring future happiness like a desert Desert Mirage that's a great name isn't it Sourpuss sourpuss
like I said Puss is like a mouth right always got that look on your face of gratitude brings forth beatitude
 our relationship to the Lord is in proportion to our save up and surrender and
 is life just a combination of Whoopi's
 is that all it is right now
