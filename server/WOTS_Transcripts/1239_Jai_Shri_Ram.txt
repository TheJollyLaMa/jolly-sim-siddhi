 I'm here a little little live life group partnered with some people are either overworked are lazy and getting some diabetic treatments we've taken over anytime. Is room and I really need it
Mario Maker more people drizzling
 big Day in India every but it's a big big Day in India they're celebrating The Prana pratishta where they call the Lord to enter into the deity huge vessel everybody's their Swami's seduced from all over India and explained enough about it it's it's the opening of the ancient Rome Temple which isn't been under when we get into it well we can tell a little something I mean otherwise there's no context right okay
 you say it I know say something
 for centuries there was a attempt of Lord Rama on the birth place of Lord Ron in the city of ayodhya so you know the City by Otis Redding about in their mind and ancient text that go back thousands and thousands of years by the way that was challenged and then they send our key
just in and they found ancient columns right so and so that that's Temple which had served as a place of not only worship but you know a place of you know where people go for deep spiritual connection that way for centuries and then that was you know when the Muslim Invaders and they did Northern India they did not only dated it they not only
 kind of killed lots of innocent people in but they've been a very purposely we're being generous it was a it was a it was a brutal genocide and so they it doesn't make it to Hollywood you know what I mean it doesn't make it to Hollywood but there's thousands of Hollywood movies about the genocide that went on in with Hitler but you're about lesser-known country is genocide sure you know so so they very intentionally tore down desecrated
do the holiest places for you know that you're always bored wrong than to Krishna in the end of the Hindus you can say and so that Temple was torn down in a mosque was built right on top of it I mean it's a it's a way that religions when they conquered lands you should they try to replace it with their culture Christians get it to you go to the you know what's the big church in that cologne giant look that up anyway that big church in Cologne Germany like it's built on top of the pagans do you put your church your new church on a what's considered a holy spot by the locals and then the ideas you keep coming back to that Holy spot but would you consider just changed which the gods I mean
 the Cologne Cathedral even beyond that it's just a way of trying to crush the spirit of people in your God's out we are in
we're wiping out all that you believe in and so on so for some centuries that stood there and then you know eventually was taken back and there's you know a huge political events that took place in I think was 92 or that mosque was torn down I believe it was inactive for a long was it was in the courts where the land of bill so you know a thousands of Hindus kind of storm didn't or down the Moscone then that became that incident led to violence to tell me all that's very unfortunate but all that being said
 the fact that after all these centuries that Lord Rama can again have another can be a temple for the Lord Rama on that spot again which there should be in there should be so it's it's kind of like a very special day for the devotees of Lord Rama
Randy today so it's a very big event imagine I don't know enough about Native American that's what I would rather take it like a man. You got to eat the entire country of this is a holy place and we're going to resurrect something here it would be a great time to rejoice
 Hindus invaded imagine of India invaded Saudi Arabia you know and just tore down everything and put a big Shiva Temple like right on top of it it would be outrageous the whole world would say this is outrageous
 or imagine if you're saying a pain in the United States of India know imagine if not only that European Invaders took over but imagine if they imagined the Native Americans had one like a central space that was particularly holy that to them for particular reason and very consciously
it was torn down desecrating a bill to church right on top of sure if if centuries later the Native Americans would regain that and and and create a you know a holy space for them to return to the same people that would be so critical of what's happening today in India would be cheering that on sure so that hard to even use that analogy because
 it was a very few people controlling so many when it came to India it was in the Elite Class of you no armies that controlled so many other Hindus here and therefore it's still primarily Hindu and so anyway what's going on now is they have rebuilt that Temple reclaim that space and inaugurated at 10 and not a great salad today and everyone in India is ecstatically losing their mind maybe not every hundred percent of the people but most of India
India's India they're doing with all these cities that were renamed by Invaders by colonists at least 8 Americas colonized people are all over the world in colonizing other countries say okay you know we said it's it's it's fighting back from the imperialism that has centuries of history from the British from the Portuguese from the from the from the from the from the Persians from the Afghan East and India never invited any of these corrections I know what we're going to do all the cities of Invaders and name renamed we're giving back the original names and about to do with any other about to call bring back bar X as the name of India because India is not an Indian name it's the Invaders names
 so yeah so when is that quite exciting so went when I went in invading country not only colonizes but you know just just rapes in a sense the nation when they when they can claim it back something beautiful
what's up chicken when it's such a beautiful culture such a beautiful deep spiritual is deep so deeply beautiful spiritual tradition we can celebrate that also the history books are being systematically Rewritten to reflect the reality of India which is the reality of India's
 we have a very ancient culture here it didn't start with the Invaders that's what they bring it back to bring it back six hundred years it went back Millennia I mean we can get into so many you know I like even what's been predominant and Academia up until very recently was the idea that you know this culture had nothing right it's a bunch of tribals and help then we educated it's it's a it's such a in terms of language in terms of architecture in terms of literature terms of philosophy in terms of the Arts
is it incredibly insanely Rich culture they came and then denied that any of it all of this existed because of an Aryan Invasion that took place like you know was really Europeans that brought all their knowledge to these people give me a break and it's about to flip everything's about to flip and I feel like we're in the midst of a whole massive
 and eat it as Republicans would say it's time to take the power back and India's take the power back actually the power back and let's face it we're all a bunch of New Yorkers and we are like inspired by yoga Sanskrit Tire Bay. These are things that are it's like it's almost like the final revenge is there's yoga schools all over the world right now it's like it talk about colonization in a beautiful way to call it Revenge but it's just that they but they won't be so they've always only wanted to share what could they have in they do have such an incredibly deep beautiful
spiritual tradition well I will say that the the teachings of spirituality from ancient India is a very broad gate it's very welcoming it's very inclusive and it's very tolerant and I can see through yoga through ayurveda and back to natural living through medicine through meditation through the through to your tongue which is massive years ago it's massive all of the world Krishna Das can sell out a concert for 700 people in Berlin you know I mean that's that's cute it was unprecedented in the history of the West and so I can see how it is is not it's not even planned but they're shifting happening people are a little bit more open to other experiences they want less Dogma in their life they want a broader understanding of spirituality we've gone to the phase of life or spirituality has been sorted
hot as it got was this Authority. Sadist dictator in people are either still going with that cuz I want to believe in God or if they're saying you know what I'm spiritual but I'm not religious I can't go to the religious thing and people are looking for a broader understanding a bit more tolerant understanding 11 concept of diminishing typical is right down to the science thank you all right you're worked up here

 alright you ready for the Nugget did you get it
 I didn't get it I said I thought I said sometimes they never said sometimes you have to think of me not to put it in and I don't hit the send button okay so I got here for you
 and I will actually take it from a take our nugget from a Muslim today I was a type of
really listen to Sufi here I believe was Sophie
 bag of God the removal of envy that God made deliver you from externals and bestow upon you and inward occupation which will absorb you so that your attention is not drawn away when you read that again God the removal of envy that God May deliver you from externals and bestow upon you an inward occupation which will absorb you so that your attention is not drawn away if we could just focus on what all these different tribes all these different religions all these we can just focus on what's in common instead of what the differences are what a better place to live this world would be
 I'm not sure if that's a rumor or talk about but I totally agree
no no no I'm not I'm just saying that resonates with everything that we said that resonates with the but to me this way I was and I agree but I think we're going to wrap up the first chapter 27 cancer today and there's been this team that what you meditate on that determines your destination right even if your demonic by Nature if you you know ship will meditate on Krishna and I granted him Liberation and you know we read we we do win it's a bug of agita we're saying that what you meditate upon that determines your next life for your future and in a general way we can understand that where we choose to place our thoughts and if we choose even even in a simple way right now like in the deepest Mystic away but in a
you know your your typical self-help Guru or something we'll have something to say about you know cultivating positive thinking positive attention and really wherever you are externally it's really what's going on in your mind that determines the state of your mental health estate of your the state of your happiness right you can you can really be anywhere ask two people can be in the exact same place in one has an internal life that's beautiful for happiness and one has an internal life is full of bitterness or criticism or depression and some much of it has to do with where they chosen to bring their mind you know as they're going through life and so here we have room me saying you know you approach God what do you approach God for commonly people approach God for external things so that they can feel happiness right he said don't let that sit actually were poaching for the exact opposite write thank God for the removal of entity okay
let me get rid of all the anime and manga stay and perhaps rooms using at the same way that we say probably this calmly to write which is more like an Old English kind of translation is animosity right so I Want to Be Free of animosity and that God May deliver you from externals and others you're not asking something from God you just asking God to help Grant your State of Mind where you have lucid Clarity that I don't need any external things do not make me do not make me happy do not have any true connection to who I really am on an eternal level okay then what am I looking for and what you're asking for is in to bestow upon you and inward occupation but I want you to help me develop my inner life which will absorb you
 so that your attention is not drawn away and run away to the externals right so I need to have a rich internal life I love the concept
internal occupation something to bring you to internally that where you where is busy internally as you would be at it later this cuz I'm sure he didn't listen English very poetic you do you know what there's currently there's a lady I met the other night cuz she came here with while you have the Iranian lady I'm yeah I'm not sure if I think she's ready I think her name is Lita ya se de se diem say I hope I'm pronouncing she was an expert on room and she's written books and I think she's currently writing another book on roommate she had a lot to offer you know I've always liked some of some of what I've read enough that I've read roommate seriously but you know you the quotes are all over the place and in in general I like them if he was on Instagram he'd have lots of followers
holding it without really understanding it I kind of get that feeling yeah sure and she and she started speaking all kinds of versus of Rumi which I'd never ever heard that were blowing my mind I mean that were deeply deeply profound about the nature of love about the nature of love and separation it was like unbelievable she was she was she was like a little walking encyclopedia really fascinating I don't know who translated this anyway it is pretty. Can I share some embarrassing moments that I just have you forgotten this route to Calcutta not the Calcutta my book might be easier to read in a book that like here yes but when it's not that it's that I'm about to do a sleep apnea a sleep test on the in the hospital and so
okay that's great going to be here by 8:30 at night and you can wear this and don't wear any metal and no facial hair we put electrodes or something on your beard on your chat and I was like I mean a little bit of facial hair right and no nothing no facial hair and I was like oh my God I just like I hate my unshaved yeah I know it's stupid it's stupid it's all external occupation and so I was like shaving my face going on man I look so bulbous my head looks like a big beach ball and it just like it is just liking some of you will agree and that's okay and it's just look at those two people in this world a hamburger heads and hotdogs and I've got a hamburger head and it's just we'll just call it a veggie burger head and I just don't like the beard gives it some type of
three dimensional fabric only blank is like my third chin is my length just like I'm not used to this and anyway I was like what am I stupid I'm here teaching we're not the body and where spirits and it's like killing me to look my head of a mirror I'm okay I'm dealing with it but it's okay I'm not a body I'm a flash but that's the problem is I'm absorbing and external
 occupation seem occupied externally here's that much anyway
 glad you got that off your chest
yeah well you know Jim Belcher is going to say I'd like to be more advanced than I am and I'm just not and I'm dealing with it because of it so openly means you just like jazz right off that it is something that's good with my illusion I can I understand you see it my Maya and I know it's going to take I think you took a big step towards that today you know sometimes people get some horrible scars or something maybe I'll need that at Loretto Heights my nose open I do remember that episode episode Mara it was like a big number 3 sliced in my nose there's a quite a few episodes cuz it was stitched yeah yeah I'd say it didn't go away but it was so deep
even the doctor was bugging out. She was like oh my God we can't do that are you kidding me there was like there for moral support and he and she was like this is your face man the doctors tell the story
 all I got there I was like character give us some time scars don't give character sometimes there just grew some you know maybe maybe sometimes it's good to have a group meeting to be just very self-conscious of your gruesomeness no. That's not what I think it is
they brought sugar cane juice
 just remember that you don't know what you're doing
 Joshua Joshua
 okay
 Sylvester Stallone died
 little ginger in there but let me see okay okay is that within the bucket tradition particularly
 I mean you know ramanuja talked about bringing the mines to Krishna he defined that is Buffy right he said it's when the mind is blowing towards Christian what the Lord Vishnu and use the term dhruv on a smart TV
 which they say that
the mine is flowing in the direction but they get the comparison that uses it's like when you pour oil right for some real thick glasses honey honey like sometimes when they have the album Shake the ritual bathing the DVDs of Krishna and different liquids to further confuse everybody LOL yeah and so now like right on time but when they for that honey it's just like it's like 100% absorption so what you do any way to pour honey all over anything or any object to save you if you pour water over the kind of splashes around tonight but honey you do it might be that certain Services don't get covered right cuz just flashes and they're dry spot but if you pour honey just oozes over where you going with us
to be like that the object of your meditation your mind is just fully stick you know it's sickly all over it you know okay deeply absorbed that's how ramen that's a ramanuja describe meditation going to Krishna now when we get to like you know 500 years later to to say July Krupa goswami and he's writing about this he's saying that by meditating on Christmas Lila by meditating on great devotees of Krishna as there were building in books like Bob the time
 it's that there's a transformation to take place in the mines for sure right and through that meditation you let go of all the lower things you let go of worrying about whether you have a hamburger or hotdog head right you let go of all of this you different attachments is showing that absorption is deeply satisfying deeply moving deeply transformational but not only that that it leads to you what you meditate on in your mind
leads to your next spiritual at least you taking on your Eternal spiritual form that you can cultivate that spiritual form internally right now and it's a it's an advanced esoteric level of bucket Crock-Pot with chocolate body as the Mind always going to Christian whatever you're doing right it if you're working if you're busy if you're doing this and doing that in so many ways. To you and your yoga in general and body specifically is about bringing the mine to Krishna I need a way to keep it going and having that what he's what what rumion is Santa's begging for you you don't go to God to get something external that just further distract you from the meditation that you're meant to be performing interested where is why a lot of people approach God in the first place because I want something external I want a husband went out it was strange they want a car I want help me with money I'm going to look at lost my job help me I want Health whatever so so you're begging God for the removal of any and be any animosity that you have two others and ask
be delivered from the external I'm tired of my mind being captivated distracted by useless external stuff in our day and age is worse than ever cuz there's just so many ways that are mine could be distracted in our time could be wasted
 some things are so disconnected Anna and what I'm asking is to have it inward deeply spiritual occupation that will absorb my mind deeply
 so that it doesn't go in other directions and that's where I want to bring up this verse by Rupa goswami
 you Bettina Muller uni you don't charge of a towel Utah Utah I'm an old beer I'm at a tag on manomay rambutans body just as the minds of young boys take pleasure in
 and young boys young girls just as the minds of young girls take pleasure in in young and thinking of young boys when they fall in love
Vice verses the minds of young boys take pleasure in young girls kindly let my mind take pleasure in you alone right so it's it's it's like a young girl if she falls in love with a young boy it's not that she has to do Sunday night to remember for sure but it's not that she needs Yoga practices to focus on my shoes now that she has to do ritual to try to shake them up enfold same thing of young boy falls in love with the young girl that some you always some Guyanese might say what are you talkin about that that Consciousness has nothing to do with yoga where you dismantle all these kind of romantic ideas and so on until we have something to learn from this made my mind with spontaneity you know the gopis of vrindavan they're actually curse in their minds that they can't get them off of Krishna thinking about this boy so they're the greatest yoga nice you know they're there meditation is deepest
we we're doing Sunday so that we can bring her mind Christian not be distracted or they can't even get distracted even if they try to explain this morning in the in the morning so I know how you and I sort of curated this whole experience here at the at the Golden Eagle Village that really is practically speaking no down time for the male mind that all we're doing is going different places around this beautiful area where you can hear
 enchant Charlotte appear to them either hearing and singing or hearing and hearing sacred literature or how did guitar or pastimes of Lord Krishna Lord Rama little samples. Yeah we're singing different songs visiting different places but that's basically all that's going on we're just like hearing and chanting sacred sounds try not to criticize try not to be critical try to be tolerant try not to take offense etcetera so keep High Vibe Consciousness and just do that all day long and then we have to eat so we eat
Rashad it will happens is you create a little Patrick petri dish dish so they were a little experimental dish where you're doing a controlled experiment isolated an isolated spot where I slept in the whole world pretty much here and then and then your set back out into the world and you get set back on your plane and and shot back into wherever you were from and why you're on that plane there's this feeling like I just happen to me I'm back in the regular world people don't act as kind as they were you know that this guy is making me fence he is being offensive and people don't speak like that I'm not used to this and then it puts you in this juxtaposition you against where you just were that in that incredible little snow globe right
 and then how to deal with it that I like how do I take something valuable away from this little experiment
and bring it back to my world yeah we got to keep that internal occupational yeah and it's really just threw this type of medication like this morning I was in my room and I heard a little six-year-old Frankie to just walk around a singing singing I was thinking she's just actually meditation isn't Sonic meditation Laura find Krishna
 Frankie it's so actually it's a such an easy process cuz it's woven into everything you do it's woven into your you were doing yoga as well but it's your work out we're doing set morning songs we're doing morning guitars we're eating krishnaprasad where it's woven into every little facet of your life so you never forget Krishna it's a whole culture of self-realization thank you
 service
the best there's nothing better
 Ryan and diversity means of Conquest what should I respect the basins east of the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Ryan Rishi the super most human being with Mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and to show the Piasa Dave the author last operation about 3 to Nature and Bug would save you all that is troublesome the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs be established as in a revocable fact to Miranda Co
Chuck should I don't believe I was born in the darkness of ignorance real dark for the ignorant I was born going to absolutely wrong direction but my teachers have open my eyes of the torch light of knowledge I've I offer my base and seas I was really running fast in the wrong direction where you will do drugs is still so go backwards
 text 30 we just heard this far out verse right which gets back to what we were just talking about
 that
 was that text 29
 yeah the grass worm remember that grass were okay just text 30 yeah but why don't you
little worm and it gets trapped in a hole in the wall oh yeah and it's got a big terrifying scary be guarding the whole garden of garden the whole but like threatening the worm coming in moving in on the way to kill the worm going to kill the worm in the worm is trapped in that hole you can imagine that when when the worm is looking at that be its entire Consciousness is absorbed in that pee but it's not distracted in any way it's deeply meditating on that I think this is a wasp Hornet honey bees do not go for maybe earlier maybe like a hornet some type of those Hornets it kind of terrifying to like all yellow and very Fierce and so you are trapped and this terrifying Beast is got you trapped in this coming in that your mind is completely absorbed in that beast and then it takes its next birth as a bee or hornet or whatever it is
 I think God Rudolf Steiner called those
Hornets demonic and honey bees he called before like Angels but where are there are levels of higher birth and lower berths you know it doesn't make them it doesn't make them as beings eat Chinese birthday parties it's right that was okay but I text 30 many many persons have attained Liberation simply by thinking of Krishna with great attention and giving up sinful activities this great attention may be due to Lusty Desires in namakkal feelings BR30 affection for or devotional service I show now explain how one received Christiansburg
simply by concentrating one's mind upon him okay so not speaking to you to steer you just you're just saw this mainly downright dirty demon should fall he hated his guts from the day he was born the whole time and then you just insulted him like again and again and again and again and after tolerating so much Christian took his head off and everybody watch this so
 shish kabob
 radiant glow of it travel through the air and enter into the bottom portion of what he was liberated why is he it's unfair why did he get liberated even though it was with a mission with the hatred with fear
 There is five ways to mention it could be with Lusty desires like with the Romantic they all Krishna I love you with an emeco feelings affection affection
okay so any one of those five ways now he turned to Narda the Great Sage in front of everyone in this big assembly Nars explaining to you too sure what just happened you know it's not only the the mind that's devoted to Krishna with devotion that that has a positive effect on actually for my goes to Christian anyway with the time intensity and it has a positive effect because he's just like one big
 contagious you know Liberation give you a liberated and in different varieties of ways chord on water just becomes shocking going to continue I just waste them explain more to you talking to you to see if I didn't keep my dear can't you just hear the gopis
Cover Girls by their Lusty desires their romantic that's how they became and by the way the Lusty here is being used cuz externally appears that way but the charges will go on to explain that really it's not like the last of this mature world where you want something for sevis in their love is entirely selfless but they're using that just kind of external he's seen that one
 comes up by his fear right by so come so as one of the other evil Kings there was a there was a prophecy Christian would take him down yeah so he was fearing him his whole his whole existence with Christian is going to kill me to kill them and then
 did you check the bishop Hall and other kings by India who does he think he is a relationship
play Christmas family family name the artist and and you the Pine View of the fond of us that's krishna's but you just give me one of the pond and you the pain of us by your great affection friendship for Krishna and we the general devotees by our devotional service is a bacta having obtained the Percy all have attained that we've all okay all of us have obtained in the Spy birthday wishes so it's kind of like we're all in the same category we have nothing in common with those that hate Krishna but we do have in common actions that were meditating a lot on Krishna and that's what makes all the difference and you get some different result you do you get some new ones result text 32 somehow or other one must consider the form of Krishna very serious focused then by one of the five different processes mentioned above one can return home back to godhead now atheists Kings like Vena however being unable to think of
this poor man any of these five ways not attain salvation therefore one must somehow think of Krishna weather in a friendly way or in the maclee so they know he was straight out the manik he was totally egomaniac just nuts
 but he wasn't focused on Christian at all where should Paul was totally to Eagle Maniac nuts but in relation to always thinking about Christian and Savannah didn't get that kind of the okay
 I'm going to continue o Bast of the pond has that would have hurt his feelings baby I love you 20 past the pain to those your two cousins just you Paul and dumped of ochra the sons of you return Elantra formerly Associates of Lord Vishnu up because they were cursed vibes
they fell from a Quinta to this material world that was the story we told her earlier to gate keepers of my Quinta giant BJ due to some offense to the forcum are as they had to take birth three times in the material world to hear more about that okay text 34 Mars you to steer inquired could affect even liberated Vishnu boxes question right there already liberated what kind of curse could do that and what sort of person could curse even the Lord's Associates it's one thing to her some evil guy with a curse you
 tell her somebody it's got that is already spiritual liberated working for Lord Vishnu
 friends or unflinching devotees of the Lord to fall again into this material world
 possible it's impossible I cannot believe this
 continued text 35 the bodies of the inhabitants of a country
completely spiritual having nothing to do with the material body senses senses or life are therefore kind of explain how the associates of God the personality of workers to descend and material bodies like the ordinary like ordinary persons
 I can barely get the question here they're already working for Lord Vishnu after they fall from vaikunta
 the bodies of the inhabitants oh yeah you're right I know 36st TARTA
 said said you'd own the Grand Canyon this place called Nara to Falls what that up there
it's possible
 Felix Jackson falls or origin not going to have anything to do with Nardo no I think it is has something to do with me
 okay
 okay heading to do it now. It's Washington State now I'm corrected
 let me know when you find something
 the bodies of the inhabitants of icons are completely spiritual have nothing to do with the remote to go down with the great Satan artist once upon a time when the four sons of Lord Ramon namely you know before name is Mara
 the waterfall was originally called Cushman Falls sort of sounds Hindu to Name Naruto by Arthur F night during a week-long trip
Mount Rainier Rainier in 1893 for the Nardo branch of the theosophical Society of Western Washington with no idea that will be all right okay Seneca okay she turned it in before Kumar's names loud
 can I come help her out Bombay
 Shannock Sonata
 set on the night you got it Sonata Hyundai Sonata
do not come on even though we may mispronouncing something since I was watching this professor give a talk on Hinduism did he get all the words wrong and it was $0.20 and they said they don't even call this Hinduism they call it sanatana Dharma and Santana odontoma so they were wandering throughout the three worlds and they came by chance to Vishnu Loca so here's the story although these four great sages were older than lorber my other son's like merici the appeared like a small little naked children only five or six years old and running around right
 really and deeply realize ages one giant video I saw them tried to enter bike with a logo of the two.
Keepers thinking they them is ordinary children
 forbade them to enter and get out of here you're naughty kids go play somewhere else. Check the doorkeepers giant BJ sananda and the other great sages very angrily curse them YouTube. I keep her as they said being agitated by the material qualities of passion and ignorance you are unfit to live at the shelter of my TV says Lotus feet but the basic Krishna vaishnav which are free from such gunas it would be better for you to go immediately to the material world and take your birth in a family of most sinful asaurus
 I know it's interesting it seems that the four cameras that have the children's bodies yeah but they have the wisdom of great sages but the child cuz I think you can probably right it's like a child when they're forbidden to go someplace they really
they don't like maybe they were they had a bit of college - fence cuz I don't want them to get mad at me but they had part of the nature of a child in that body it seems.
 Little man I don't want to get cursed unless that's a thing sometimes your sickness is if you could give her this
 it's a whole thing
 that's heavy tomorrow's weather for tomorrow's cursed John Vedra that The Gatekeepers they did have to live out the curse they had to come down and take those bursts and the other money incarnations
but eventually they were released in nine hours still curse but they cheap to hire destination yet and yeah I mean like when when it was Narda who cursed now cooker even money MoneyGram vanilla caveira to stand is treat long time and then going to get liberated by Christian but guess what they had trees for a long time it's hard to be a tree I could you just imagine that's like me I'm so bored it's cold Winter's coming there's a dog get out here
 the newest can come they're waiting for that I don't want I wonder how much Consciousness a tree has its they do communicate we know that but we know that once they were cut down a release they had full Consciousness and memory and all of that so I don't know I suppose that doesn't necessarily imply that they had it the whole time it's a tree with a definitely had it soon as I got cut down I wonder if they're like
like being trees like this you know I mean maybe she's like a dull kind of ache or to take for app for 400 years
