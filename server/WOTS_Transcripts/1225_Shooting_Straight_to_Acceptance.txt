 Friday tell friend Friday spread this word share like a heart that drop a picture of a heart are you kaszuba however you want to put it
they're getting ready to leave tomorrow all my kids are a little kid is taking off tonight to Rune take him to the airport
 no actually his mother came to bring them away I had a date with him we have father-son date we would we like to have serious talks series father-son kind of stuff have you ever had a serious father-son talk yeah I have that usually involves in don't ever watch Lord of a warning parents new parents you just traumatize with the kid a hand again never ever take drugs no good comes from set up after 10

 I'm never taking serious drugs
 no I'm careful where I swim
 you don't skip a rope all eating stone fruit my life many times over my mom is a whole barrel of wisdom
 but anyway we did we went to the trampoline park I was like you know what I'll just sign up for 3 hours at the trampoline park 45 minutes and I was like
 I was like I'll I think our time is running out to ruin is it for 45 minutes
about 2 hours or so time flies when you're jumping on this thing
 oh God okay how do you feel this morning are you sore I'm a little I'm a little like I've been on a trampoline for 3 hours that's how I feel this morning and it's not like that he's like okay now get back up here in the back up there to back up here it's just that you just putting me through all these tests as they listen you you was a prime of your jumping life
 I'd like the onion weird thing is it's like I'm the only weird and especially when he runs off to jump somewhere else then I'm surrounded by a bunch of six year olds that look like some creepy guy on the trampoline
 it was good
 are you can still buy when he tells about you walking around Barefoot for three months have you ever put on shoes in 3 months
 two and a half months and put on shoes
two and a half months without socks you are in the sake of slippers none of that none of that just walking barefoot
 I've been fine so good feeling isn't it it's not just grounding people it's not just touching the Earth and getting me honoring the dominant eye and saurians it's a honoring the sacred and holy place in today at 12:30 and 1 eastern time and no show on Sunday or Monday
 and tomorrow so people have questions they can write to us at wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com okay what do you think of my headband
I thought it had a good husband
 it's okay I bought it for Mara for Christmas because somebody listens Michelle works for Patagonia and they gave me a discount
 that product placement it's just I bought it for her and I was cold cuz I shaved my head and I wore it
 that's where you're supposed to say I looks good okay
 yeah tomorrow's date
 sure ready for nugget sir I am
 because Steven notes from
 Nathaniel Branden
 you know who that is yeah he was a Canadian American psychotherapist and the writer known for his work in Psychology the psychology of self-esteem
 is recess is one of the things you say
the first step toward change
 is awareness
 the second step
 is acceptance is right out of a intervention isn't it
 it's interesting to say that I don't know I've never been to an intervention is that kind of do they have a certain path they walk in general I'm not positive I know it's like people usually it starts off like this I invite you out to dinner with my friend from California is here in a second and then you're like oh no what is this
 and you realize that there's a bunch of people you know in one roommate weren't expecting to see and they all sit you down you know they sort of like love you and they all start to say hey look we're here
because we feel like you're going through serious problem maybe you can't see it but you're not aware of figured out a way to help you become so the intervention is there when you are so oblivious don't they don't always work as far as I know if interventions because some people just don't want to admit they have a problem but I guess sometimes the emotional weight of the whole thing makes them kind of give yeah yeah then sometimes whenever if it's alcohol they want to or they're all ready to order if they're attached to alcohol they're all ready to order a drink okay I'm going to meet you at the exchange
 anyway so that's an intervention in and of course the only way that things going to work is if I get to the point where I like them all these people love me
 they must have my best interest in
and I'm going to accept what they say
 there's something about acceptance you know of course and anything that we bring up you can always flip it in and turn it into a negative Pride like all except it's just means you're not dealing with the world being you know why do you know determine door or active or dynamic there's always a place for that for sure
 but something about some deeper vision of accepting the world as it is not always trying to shift it to adjust to the desires that are programmed in my mind right now so this is as the first step is awareness and in the second step is acceptance worth seeing in the Bible time we're seeing a shoot your K2 he's been given his curse is like really
 it's B you know he had to accept that is his son died you know that was hard hit no choice and accept it and now he's going to go
curse to take to take birth it in in a family of asuras you know he is living a really beautiful life
 oh yeah and it's almost like I said like that's headed towards Liberation and now he's got to take another berth where it's like on the whole opposite direction apparently seems to me and rather than fight it
 he accepts it you do you say intervention what I thought of when I saw this
 was the five stages of grief
 are the five stages of grief yeah Elisabeth Kubler-Ross
 did she come up with this could be that's what the allegation is
okay so what are they
 oh I don't know them but I don't know acceptance is the first one I think that's the last of the last last re acceptance what are they called again the five stages of grief and anger is also not acceptance bargaining
 I have just three more days depression God it does five stages of grief to the are the commonly is the context, lie like one here is like I've got cancer or like one's own death on his own mortality about death yeah I think so or like a loved one that got died
yeah I was thinking that I could be anything that's my point is you're all your money in the what's-his-name pyramid scheme guy Madoff Madoff thing kill that guy bargaining. I'll take half of it give me half of it what else depression
 and then acceptance it was meant to be in spite that went back to the anger but yeah I think you're right that's like let's take Church of K2 right now he's flying high as life is good he's doing good
 he makes a statement
Lord Shiva Parvati is upset with statement and she curses him and
 you know a lot of ways he could have reacted he could have said this can't be true you wouldn't curse me and not not not and then tell him I said no man you better get it through your head Hargitay she's like personification the material energy like when she curses
 it goes through so you better get ready you're going to you're going to take births in the family with Soros and then he could have become angry like who Do You Think You Are the person of what what's the matter with you why would you do me and I'm bargaining like okay I did I did something wrong maybe but come on over it really shouldn't be this level of you know of reaction for let's talk about this let's work out something better
 and then it could have gone into depression you know you could have just been miserable
he jumped immediately to Acceptance in and we're going to hear more today about the context in which he is able to do that that the broader context that he's accepting cuz he's not just accepting that this is what Parvati did he's accepting that ultimately God's behind everything and ultimately God is benevolent at every step so he's accepting it in and not sense any say I don't blame you at all party and then we're going to hear about that but you know he was also you know going back to it Nathaniel Brandon said he's he's saying the first step towards changes awareness
 the second step is acceptance so he was made aware of so much in the previous chapter you know
who's made aware that my son is in my son my son is another living being like we all are and we're going to name anybody is saying I'm not this body and I'm not the king and and so on and so forth you know he didn't and and that there is Lord Vishnu behind everything is Heather's Verdi play excuse me very deep level of spiritual awareness that he's working from her and from that platform it is able to accept you know he's able to he's not how embarrassing it is in Alexa, she is also based on that kind of thing a lot to write words he's someone just can't accept their circumstances and fight it this way they fight it that way and it makes fools of themselves he's not making a fool of myself at all these George Costanza gets a toupee
 I just couldn't accept it
yes I could accept Okay I lost my hair just he can excite want to change and he wants to just it you know because he's got a false conception of who he is as a false conception what will make him happy he's thinking the to pay is going to help his self-esteem and it helped him get what he wants in life and he's so it makes an adjustment it doesn't work and it's a full-time self larger that's what material existence of these videos are people mouthing off to the judge and the judge is already said okay I sent it to you before you know no three days of you know three days in jail Monopoly or 3 days ago that you please sir that's what you're going to get otherwise going to hold you in contempt of court he still mouth open up OK 5 days in jail they keep on going and it's amazing how like it's like a refusal to accept and then it just like complicates and complicates their life even more
sponsor. I'd like to go from to go from you know the intervention to complete acceptance you have to just take full responsibility whatever I've got I've got the hard thing to do it's a hard thing to do you know we can you I think we can use these five stages of grief to just analyze our own response to any difficulty that we've got a flat tire and I angry about it you know I am I am a angry am I depressed about it you know what what's Deja am I in can I accept an exit are you going to take let me take the depression eggs and stay there for someone to just stay at these
 exit and sit there and you never come to denial
 bargaining
yeah it will sit and stay off on that exit and then sit there sometimes you're 40 years will sit in anger or sit and depression or sitting right I've seen devotees
 even renuncias still caught up over things that happened 40 years ago me to meet you it's a country club
 doesn't mean you're a liberated stole it gives you information but all these like real simple stuff that we talked about right now is Swami or anything if you don't apply these basic ABC's you might externally appear very evolved but you'll hit a very low ceiling for your Evolution you can't be around a boxy for 40 years and still have resentment in your heart and how you were wrong that stuff's got to be
you got to come to terms with that you know it and just imagine how much smoother life will be
 if we learn to go straight to acceptance you know what like if we remember one of the barometer another brown chair with sharing how you know how you learn to go straight from straight from intelligence into action you bypass the money's in the impulsive mind with its with its desires and so on you go straight from from from reasoning you bypass the mines demands and go straight into action this is similar you know like something some there's some occurrence in your life some reversal in your life you know we heard yesterday that quote by Lorde from are you know to
 pretty Marsh is a kindly I love the way couch to someone kindly take my words with great respect
I'm saying respect me right but he said the words I'm about to speak to you there it's truth honor this truth right respect this truth
 he said we should always remember
 that if something happens by providential Arrangements
 we should not be very sorry about it right it is saying it that way you know we should not be depressed about it the more we try to rectify
 such reversals
 the more we enter into the dark is reaching materialistic thought right then whenever we're in that dark is to regen a materialistic girl whenever they're stuck deep hostility and anger and resentment that we just cannot go over this that's that's completely call it or mind you know it is not making us feel any better it's making us miserable and and it's it it's commonly not even effective in changing anything
check ourselves you know Tootsie home I said I'm angry I'm in the anger stage iiib I'm not accepting stage right I need to get to that except in stage to find relief and to accomplish the goal of human life which is to focus my where to some Krishna in a focus my weariness and truth I'm even like you're saying even I bought into the whole okay I'm about to Yogi you know I got a new shoes I got the name and she said no big deal it's nothing tell me something but it means nothing in the bigger picture of why we're here how to run thrown over your shoulder who got Nick B's we got various bead bags I've got my Vulcan House Black Flag shirt on Krishna Hari Krishna shirt on wish I was
putting FB trampoline park in City walk in there thinking you're the coolest guy had some reaction I got nothing maybe because the kids can't read yet
 how dare you guys last time
 come on back to call and he was not eat up there and you just
 7 year old on a trampoline together we would be like okay rock bouncing I'm going to wait a little bit until he's done and then I'm going to go on not five-year-olds they're just like running they don't understand that my jump could propel them to another
trampoline and then the cutting in line I was like okay kid there's a queue here come on
 oh my God okay okay so so why don't we go ahead and get the munchies and start reading the box down
 there I am the mosquito is the Supreme Lord Narayan let you know Andre see this you will see what being a goddess of learning and to be off today of the author not stop our usual botheration to Chum Bucket bag of Vegeta Michelle okay back to your bubble tea
text to KI the regular tennis in class in the back of a time and my rendering service with a devotees all that is troublesome the heart we could eradicate it and let me service to the Supreme Lord who is praise a transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable the fact I was born in darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge after I pay since he's at their Lotus feet
 we can finish my bike with Tom Canto 6 chapter 17
 it's a good luck okay so now we're going to get chitra k2's respond he's just been cursed she was I mean she's Durga Devi she can to say what she wants but she was very sarcastic
you know that kind of thing hurts when someone gets hurt cuz she was saying stuff like is it that Lord Romano longer understands Dharma and the Fork, Arizona. You're the person now is that though is that you know it's like it was very sarcastic and not only that but not only that but he came with his very
 heavy consequence you take Hugo lower you go down right
 University near Universal situation you take birth in the family of a saurus now you won't even have the association of devotees that way the thing that you treasure most
 the thing that you treasure most for your heart that thing that you treasure most for your shelter in life dissociation of the of the box of yogis now you're not going to get that you're going to go down you're going to go into the to the Sun going to be born into the family of a saurus you know
that's how he wants to eat there was no denial there's no anger there's no bargaining there's no depression he went straight and acceptance going to see that right now
 can a teacher Katie said my dear Mother with my own mind your mother's talking to the goddess with your mother with my own hands folded together except the curse upon me I do not mind the curse for happiness and distress are given by the demigods as a result of one's past Deeds own
 so there's a relaxing Amish people like so many murders their son and then they like forgive the person immediately and welcome them into their family and you know
 that's really something it's forgiveness because we were talking about getting off on the exit before acceptance we get off at the exit of anger get off the exit of resent
and bitterness like those are those are serious exits that ruin people spiritual life and material life around bitter angry for how you been wrong
 I mean again like you and I both know and no of people that are practicing about you over there to this day bitter bad stuff just doesn't matter it doesn't matter at least at this stage it doesn't matter but it's still I still comes out and sometimes it comes out every conversation
 okay
 so I want to share those some here running from the commentary so property rights
 this is part this is part of the background about why should your K2 couldn't be easily go straight to acceptance I even though he was insulted it was insult and injury
Adam both right
 so proper about the devil is always eager to return home back to God in and remain there
 as the Lord associate this ambition this is nice listen to this one okay
 this ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart
 and therefore
 he does not care about material changes in his life
 so as one thing is going up is the scale right as one thing is rising other thing is setting it was one of those one things going up there others going down so as my as the as the genuine hankering I have in my heart for dissociation of Krishna in spiritual Realm
 as that goes up as that becomes more more fervent
 my concern
what's the speak of my anger resentment bargaining depression about the changes of this world goes down right in your cages his his spiritual ambition his spiritual desire was so high that even such a serious thing he went straight to acceptance
 okay
 listen to this big stuff Here My Dear Mother if we just like it like our listeners here right if we just called it a little test experiment we said the next time someone insults me
 mechanical straight to acceptance get on your knees and just put your hands in the mistake so you know what excuse my dear Mother
and don't call me mother
 presently being harmed and they're like yeah
 I may just try that you know just see how much how am I capable of shooting straight to acceptance
 or do I just not have that in me or can I believe move through the stages quickly but they're just speaking a lot of us are trying to complicate our life
 annoying annoying us can we just be like a duck's feathers to pour water on a duck liver per water and a ductless dealer I do it all the time earlier than a beads off and rolls off their back
 I've done it
 and yeah can I sort of behaving like a protective bubble not caring
people think of me what up what a liberating statement can I not care right with it it's none of my business what they even think of me that's okay okay okay that's 18
 exiting deluded by ignorance the living entity that's the soul wanders in the forests of this mysterious material world
 that's what this material world sound Forest enjoy the happiness and the distress resulting from his past Deeds
 everywhere and at all times
 doing the happiness in distress
 therefore my dear Mother neither you nor I am to be blamed for this incident very interesting except not a victim of a I've got I've got now what now what am I going to do with what I got
like I shouldn't have got this this is horrible it's unfair you should never have done this to me what do you think you are don't you know who I am how about I got what I got
 now what am I going to do now how am I going to react so I can have a healthy positive Progressive evolutionary life make some better choices you get what you get and don't be upset when the kids were little you know I want the blue light at the end of the month and don't be upset what are the end of the month when you have to pay the tuition fee for the kid that's what I start said it's not the school you get what you get
 it would be getting don't throw a fit that's a good one to saraswoti thank you
you get what you get don't throw a fit
 or is it to rhyme
 okay text 18
 I don't know text 19 test in this material world neither living entity himself nor others friends and enemies are the cause of material happiness in distress
 but because that means like the situational up or down right because of gross ignorance a living entity thinks that he had he and others are the cause we won't have to stress on her mind but he are saying like suppose I'm in a walking down the road and there's a whole and I trip and fall in the hole it's not my fault it's not like we're always trying to especially in this litigious world were always trying to see who is responsible for this we want to take somebody down to stake our claim and I
and even that one is like it is more indirect like okay I fell down the hole and you know it might look like while I'm the one to blame right but even if someone does something like he Parvati chose to curse him severely
 so even in that circumstance he thinks she's not the cause there's something behind her right right and that's the key to acceptance nothing happens to you deliberately this is a huge this actually happened they're seeing a bigger a much bigger picture the sing the Divine hand and otherworldly Celestial Divine hand and what's going on and that helps that helps unstick like the mucoid plaque of my heart would you I'm trying to find
the devil you know and it's not a Devil Jin Angel there's actually God working through situations and people to uplift me don't blame the person go right to something bigger and say what am I going to get out of this what what is there for me in the situation with people's hearts become pure is ICO this is benevolent somehow this is benevolent this is going to bring me to where I have to go there's something I have to let go up in my mind in my entitlement in my in my privilege there's something I have to see bigger than me you know I think a lot of it has to do with getting used to thinking that way
 and then it becomes more more natural rights within the route like in the world that like you and I have lived in for a long time running outside the world of
relations between bhaktiyog he's within institutions or within
 various types of settings where I come in to take a different roles and so always someone has to be in charge you know that someone has to be in charge of the whole project Simon has to be in charge of this department of it not a Utopia come join me and and dumb
 even then just like when you want to cooperate with others you get disappointed you get you know sometimes you get removed from a position that you feel you've earned or you feel you can do better than someone else you know what happened to you it's happened to me and it happened to practically everyone I know at one point or another you know and then there's always some you know sometimes that's done with respect and done relatively smoothly sometimes it's done I'm going to Brighthouse way mercilessly like yet
Trabass clear desk ever had one of those clear your desk
 fired Mara I forgot it but somebody here those are the kind of things that Adam there can be long-lasting oh yeah you know you know at worst hostility
 and you no lesser than that even just awkwardness you know like I don't really have any place in my heart for this person anymore and whenever I see him it's awkward and just makes the whole life a little bit more gloomy and you know where is like if we did this key to acceptance It's not on that person even if it was wrong even if we miscalculated even if it was done callously
I'm seeing someone but further behind that person the Divine hand behind that person that moved my world and that's Christians loving soft loving Lotus hand I accept it completely accept it completely now now
 I no longer bearing the weight of that hostility in my mind becomes free you know the big to be peaceful and to be absorbed in in bhakti and without it it's just it's like you're trying to swim across the river and I will wait you carrying this weight you know it's slowing you down so just in case if he doesn't have it you can have it at all you just went straight to acceptance and and he's he's sharing the keys to it of of why he's capable just cuz I know it's not you that's just did this to me
 and there's there's a Divine hand behind it all and I accept it except my own responsibility in it that way
misery comes across my path in life that his reaction to my previous actions and accept all of the Gods behind it all and that it's all meant for my own even for the elevation my own awareness except
 text 20
 this material world resembles the waves of a constantly flowing river there for
 what is a curse and what is a favor he's taken to the next level right now so I can do you understand it's a good it is not even like there's good and bad in this world is it's it's a thing that is always shifting always changing always movie
 it's all good. People say that it's all good but actually is all good
 what are the Heavenly plan
what are they started this with your old world resembles the waves are constantly flowing river there for what is the curse and what is the favor what are the Heavenly planets and what are the hell is planets what is actually happiness and what is actually distress because the waves blow constantly none of them has an eternal a fact so interesting I'm when you're dealing with all this and I need to deal with like astrology in counteracting malefic planets and Yogi she want to ascend higher planets and back to yoga we accept all these things actually work this mystical stuff is metaphysical stuff actually works but for a devotee we've given the process anyway the idea is we give up that in desire for sense gratification and we just want to be of service and where can I be of service and I only be of service in Beverly Hills where the
 what's it called in Bombay
Malabar Hill bar Hills Malabar Hills in the ghetto you can be of service
 and that's what you want me to take birth on hell okay if that's where I can serve go to take birth in this situation yeah you got this task in front of me okay that's how you want me to serve okay I'll Trust you it is however I can serve please let me serve and that's why they say
 Krishna boxes are always peaceful in this world you're going to get lordship is about to give us that we have here at property rights here he says the so-called temporary happiness of this because you're okay to do let's go back to where he was right it said he was the king of the Vida dhara's this this this race of you no interplanetary beautiful beings
and he's flying around with like beautiful Vdara women
 you know and it sounds like life is pretty good here somehow it's it's still it's still tied in with his is a spiritual Quest somehow you seem like he's getting the both the both of us worlds right it was like he was he was deeply spiritual and at the same time he was like in an incredibly beautiful Pleasant material circumstance and Parvati on a dime turns the whole thing around
 and call the Supercar fail to scuba diving a Supercar next minute boom been out in from his perspective is like it's okay because even when I was flying in my spiritual are playing with all the Beautiful video Darwin Dino
 that my happiness is not tied to this at all and that this could change in a moment I had already
student accepted that some of the curse came he's like yeah this is this is a constant changing River I can I'm expecting that it is going to change so probably the so-called temporary happiness of this world is also misery
 are there any grants we cannot understand this this is the actual position is it
 you can just read over this or you can actually begin to apply to life and see just how what a deep truth or isn't it when one comes to their senses when they become Krishna conscious they're no longer concerned
 is the maturity here they're no longer concerned with the various conditions of this material world
 they are not concerned with happiness of distress curse curses of favors or Heavenly or hellish planets they see no distinction between them
 it's all material energy in a constant state of flux
he's got you understand that deeply
 stuck on save your life Customer because our life is like destroyed
 by these things that were talking about earlier exchange to stay in your mind this and this room is that mean this bitterness this anger and frustration is denial you know sometimes I make it so that I can resentful and angry and bitter I'm in denial talk to Mara she'll tell you my plan this whole little thing and I'm going to say I get angry to nice to know they're just blink if I guess we have a weapon or the hatchet
 not even a hatchet right now it's like a small
so we are stopped here so we're even 156 Mara says one more okay I like it when there is like
 text 21 at the screen personality God had is one my defect is one supreme personality of God had his one unaffected by the conditions of the material world he creates all the conditions Souls by his own personal potency because of being contaminated by the material energy the living entity is put into ignorance and us into different conditions of bondage
 sometimes by knowledge the living entities given Liberation and set the Guna and Rodger Guna he is subjected to happiness and distress
this is again let's go back to the beginning first step is awareness second step is acceptance he's sharing his awareness he's sharing his awareness of how the universe functions
 and with that awareness acceptance has just become easy for he can shoot straight from the circumstance
 bypass all the five stages of grief denial anger bargaining depression
 and shoot straight for acceptance and that's a beautiful soul that's some of this learn the lessons in like that someone is moving through here with grace that someone that can help us kind of get our lives in you know straightened out
 it's interesting it in his previous Life Church of K2 actually went through those processes he was in denial you know he got angry
Bargains please just bring the soul back so I can say goodbye to the soul yeah but now he's at a different level of awareness so when he got tested again
 he was right he went through a lot of stuff in your previous life because you're pretty even minded and steady I think this is the life I'm going through it all this is the life I'm here to learn lessons and you know my next time I'll take birth in a family of devotees and they'll teach me how to offer incense with love
 I think you're doing is miss my cousin said that this was what they call it
 he did say I had a
 Moksha Yoga Yoga Yoga which means I think I got two glasses, because I definitely haven't learned that I still have to go. I've never put away and take out the old milk when I leave it out it like on a regular basis I can't get back to God
that's an issue we're going to
 15 mares there
 I'll do whatever makes lessons that there's all kind of things her own and I haven't become humble I am really intolerant humble than a blade of grass more tolerant than a tree wanting no respect from others offering all respect to others if it helps out cuz I'll stop giving you respect if that helps stomach make you wanted more
 good point I I'll give you more respect then you'll be like that sounds like
all right I wasn't expecting the laugh this much
 I still can't get this vision of me of yesterday running around with a bunch of five-year-olds all the adults what is going to do this with the kids was it like Kramer doing karate with it looks like it's not like I'm a thirty-year-old parent I'm like a 57 year old parent with a white beard I look like Santa Claus on this trampoline freaking the kids out and no one mentioned your Black Flag Christmas shirt that harsh sometimes may I really
please I got some good stuff today awareness and acceptance
 where does that excite God is behind everything and benevolent at every step
 keep that in mind work from spiritual awareness to accept everything
 sheesh material existence is just embarrassing I love that I'll wear that shirt I'll wear that to the trampoline park bypass the first four stages of grief and go straight to acceptance
 a spiritual ambition Rises resentment anger and depression decreases
 yeah are you getting don't be upset love it I mean that could be the whole bag of time
almost one of the cantos one can tell is you get what you get and don't be upset that's finished next see the Divine hand working to uproot the mucoid plaque on the heart like that mucoid plaque of the heart music what kind of flag is it you could you call your Google is the word is it is it is in the colon but how do you spell it m u c o i d mucoid plaque
 look hard stool where is McCoy black
 nucleotide is a pseudo-scientific term I'm a scientist of sorts but he bring it up over here
I'm sorry I don't subscribe to your a big Pharma however and wherever I could serve please let me serve that's so nice something Santa Claus would say your mother I accept my dear Mother my dear Mother I mother I just killed a man
 life has just begun
 if you don't then I will surely die.
doesn't really matter
