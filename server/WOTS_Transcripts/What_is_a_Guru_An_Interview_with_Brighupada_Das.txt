 yes thank you thank you for letting me be on the show this is very exciting letting you be thank you for for accepting the invitation we're so glad to have you here
 when we talk right into it you're here and by the way you're here in New York in 4th and you'll be here at the Rath yatra today yes so anyone wants to look for a
some Dapper man I want to ask him some questions on scholarly vaishnava bhakti yoga related subjects you can find them there but you probably won't be wearing the suit to the snow depending the time it by Snowball to hell and what will be your outfit today will it be a dhoti or more like a white plastic but I'm sure it'll be done with your own special you're just in your own special Dapper way
 now what you see rugged today he can get creative on days like this are you going to go with that white outfit that is wearing there
 hope your your last time you would tell you
 we can't hear you think he's going all right
 okay that's kind of his like oshoala
brother goes alright that's it so sure thing you know all white big white beards you know got to go to Bob and maybe that's something that we need to talk about today to is the group Bob is it like is it totally external is there something real to it we need to know who's going to leave now
 this is yet if you haven't even got it started and already things are falling apart looking forward to seeing you both into the topic Professor I just looked let's let's start in the most fundamental and simple way you know you you you you wrote a doctoral thesis
 what were the guru is in in specifically would have grew is within our lineage
particular branch of Krishna bhakti the Dell device Neverland usually follows the street to Tanya and it's it's such an important topic because this is how the lineage is maintained and it's such an essential part of the practice of bhakti but it's you know it's it's it's it has a history that has a philosophy behind it it has it's it's I guess you could say it's the practical way it's it's is practiced within within the the lineage and maybe it's been practiced in different ways at different time so I think commonly there's a lot of confusion on this subject
 posted in the general public within the yoga world and even within the tradition itself it can be confusing cuz it's so much teasing about it coming from different angles so I thought I would just start with the simplest of questions and just ask you what exactly is a guru
that's a good question the basic meaning of the word guru in in Sanskrit is heavy so so I think the most kind of basic basic translation of the word guru would be an authority
 and the way the word girl is used in many Indian context that you're your parents would be a group so your your your your husband or your wife will be your girl would like that but then many times does a differentiation between grew and sadhguru yeah. I mean there's a person that calls himself sud Guru today but the meaning of surgeries is is a spiritual Guru or or a true group says the person who is not simply an authority
because of being elderly or what a person who go to counseling teacher in general so you could have like your piano Guru on your dance group who is somebody who is
 who is teaching you spiritual topics so so like like power part of them speaks about to go to as the spiritual Master could be a translation video of sadhguru
 Do you have more than you want to share no no no you gone go on the term can can be use it has been used to apply in a casual way to person that's an authority or teacher in a particular subject but then there's this other category where it seems like the subject becomes more grave and maybe more mysterious
when we get into what you call a sud Guru or a guru that's teaching and biting and instructing in the spiritual Realm
 yes because I mean if you want to know if somebody has to go to piano teacher
 listen to find out or if you want to know if somebody would do good teacher
 teaching Asana but when you speak about a spiritual teacher that's more difficult to kind of judge from an outside perspective and and
 we easy also getting to mystification.. Perhaps a spiritual teacher that needs to be somebody who who lives in a cave in the Himalayas or or has the grey beard or Deadlox or something like that yeah that's of course
 that's not necessarily what we're looking for
what you know maybe I'm jumping into this question too soon to bring it up within the tradition when it comes to the sun grew so much is written whether it's like historical kind of narrations of great devotees and their relationships with their gurus
 whether it's just kind of like straight out instruction derived from the ancient texts about how to relate to a guru how to approach your Guru how to serve a there's so much with that sounds on I suppose you could say sounds extreme it sounds like you're relating to this person. Like you're relating to your piano teacher your piano teacher you're supposed to show up and do this generally respectful and they're going to give you some assignments and you know hopefully you're you're taking it serious enough that you'll actually set aside the time to do it and you come back next week and you see where you're at when we talked about this spiritual Guru
we read so much worse we like you're giving your entire life you giving your entire heart to your giving up your Independence you're you're really surrendering everything it whether it's in the devotional songs it's so much as I like that how do you understand that it's too I think to the West remind me to leave there going to say what this appears to be very dangerous potentially dangerous relationship from your own studies looking at what are your thoughts on that as well as being a part of your proof person that that practices that you have your your Guru as well so you're you're you're seeing it in one sense from both ends I suppose from within the traditions and then as a scholar trying to see it through the lens of an outsider I suppose it would you characterize your work yes yes and I think I think we dealing with many different things here and in your question definitely goes to Progressive
this is a very grave topic spirituality so so dealing with your spiritual teacher because of the nature of the topic will be a more
 more serious and and
 an all-encompassing thing than dealing with your piano teacher for example because it is not just about what we feel within us or what we believe and it's also inoculation our spiritual life is something that is supposed to permeate all of our levels of being how we sleep how we eat or we go to work how we deal with our families and so on so so so the nature of the topic means that the relationship with the spiritual teacher is going to be little bit different than to try the teacher stopped in there supposed to be a cultural aspect in many Eastern traditions
deal with all kind of authorities in any way that is kind of boring to too many of us in the western world
 and that we also don't always understand correctly like to see it if you go to 220 Indian Guru that you'll see the disciples bowing down to the guru say yes go to you yes what do you say and so on but much of that this is its culture like to the parents by touching their feet when they see them the first thing in the morning did touching their head their hand to their head and some other types of expression
 like you're not supposed you're not supposed to disagree publicly with for example your your parents but it doesn't mean that you always need to do that exactly what they say around that in different ways
like I have a friend who's who who when he was young and full of shit
 his father said I'm not allowing it all of your brother so I'm already gone I brought I'm not going to allow you to go abroad I want to have somebody here when I grow old how old was he well my friend was maybe twenty or something like that and so he said okay but then he was so kind of obviously sad for a few days that his mom then went and spoke to his father and then
 okay let me know I was not allowing you to go so some lots of this kind of yes yes yes is his cultural and that's important because their relationship with the good ways we learn it
Ingo device my medicine it's not about the the disciple being this kind of starry-eyed a guru groupie who was just kind of said yes to everything looks like he's going to ask questions
 in case not he's going to argue with Krishna he's going to say what you just said this but before you said that how is it actually a two-way relationship
 learning is not something that you simply kind of pour into another person write in the in the meeting between just got to be some tension perhaps it'll make some progress to get the Heat a good lesson disciples
it's not always kind of straightforward how everything goes okay let me ask you this cuz you kind of got us started on defining what agar is as you know a teacher button in this context you know within a very serious or grave subject area
 I think when most people probably even in India definitely in the Western World when they hear the word guru and they their stereotypical idea
 is this kind of popular figures I suppose we could call them that you know they kind of blow up on the scene in different ways in the 60s different gurus came to America you know there are units are typically they were bearded and they seemed to embody an aura of Peace perhaps you know and they're kind of just seen as Wiseman
you know that or just kind of you know where you can throw questions at them and they're going to give you these wise answers a lot times the answers will be a little puzzling perhaps indicating that I'm not that deep and I've got so far to go but it's just like I don't think there's much conception of a lineage being represented necessarily but there's just like maybe then maybe we don't even know like if you listen to sud Guru or are many others like this I don't know if they're so much quoting directly from shastra so much presenting themselves as a representative of the Linea but they're kind of just like I'm a wise man
 what what how would you how would you contrasted with leitao grew in the gallery version of a lineage what's the difference
 Italy's people actually gurus would you say you know or at least from the perspective of this lineage
well I think it's important to realize that all of the the the the Hindu tradition lacks a kind of central Authority that would be able to stop this is a really good but that's really what makes somebody a Google but from our perspective our Traditions perspective
 people like like the ones you mentioned they say they're not gross of a what we are after
 okay we come to our gurus to learn about bhakti to Radha Krishna
 and these people got no teaching that that the teaching something else sent and how well they do that I'm not sure I'm able to stay but a few hints
question of course we're interested in a particular type of bacteria and we're also interested in a particular lineage of teachers that give that kind of Foxy and that's that's something that this is kind of far and too many of these modern gurus they they are Gru's by their own kind of Christmas Merit Dental members of any lineage Shore or anything like that and of course it means that they can kind of make up things us as they go they don't need to think about what station has said they don't need to be burdened by old IDs and so on but from my perspective that I'm any qualms with that this well and and Juanes that such a good ways not really on dirt
 are there any buddies control and there's a possibility for abuse or Miss
the power and so on when there's nobody who's kind of about you or or even perhaps it's no yardstick by which to measure whether they're playing their role is actually I mean there are some some kind of common common definitions of a lot of glue should be like but the one thing that many people forget today is that a girl should always also be a student
 from from our perspective a real Guru will always be a student himself or herself
 that means that the guru has a guru as well
 so so did you eat something that comes already very early not listen in the way that that HR has our teachers speak about spiritual knowledge to do something that needs to be handed down gradually
 okay this is interesting cuz now we're four
we're taking the broad definition that you shared in the beginning and I was looking at the form within that this particular Tradition now the we got more specific going back to that brought her ID and some of these you know kind of quote on quote like popular pop gurus if you if you want it almost feel sometimes like
 their story may just be like you know I was a normal person and then we'll I've had this experience and it opened up my third eye and now I see things that others don't see and I'm ready to share them with people that's almost like that whereas within the tradition is like no no no I studied very carefully and was trained very carefully within a tradition that's been carefully had to down and I'm not
 I'm not presenting myself as I had some kind of
 shaktipat moment where where where there was some mystical thing happened as Surly but I'm
careful representative of a tradition
 maybe there's some of the other there too is black today
 yes that this definitely is some of the other end into I mean we have all kinds of goodies and some of them are more kind of gay
 lineage holders that their main notification for being a good ways being a disciple of the descendant of a previous Guru Guru said that's one of the interesting things with our tradition that we have this kind of blend of various types of groups and and various understandings of of how important the the lineage of the traditionalist but definitely is it's much more important than in the case of these is a kind of modern modern middle-class Urban Hindu Guru
okay so let's talk about these varieties of gurus you know
 it's it it's a fad like if you take the bringing of Bucky to the west by Sheila prophet and then all of the followers so you know that that which are you know within his own institution that established iskcon or those that have branched off to those that are kind of like there before but are kind of intermingling with it at this time
 the
 the challenge of
 of maintaining this aspect of the tradition right did the challenge of this this idea of a person taking on such a grave responsibility of representing it well the role that plays in the lives of the followers when they don't play well you know the fact that that has it creates so you know a lot of questioning you know what particular days with the internet and so on people with a p
and everybody's got their thoughts about it sometimes I hear people say
 like princess when when I began to practice bhakti within the international Society for Krishna consciousness
 there was I don't I don't know exactly how many Brewers were operating with it and that institution at that time it might have been like
 50 or something something like that
 maybe even less maybe Thirty or so I'm not sure and and the ones that had a lot of disciples it might have been like 1000 or 2000 it's at least it seemed to be at the time
 now some of those same groups are or others may have 10,000 disciples or 50,000 sometimes it until you hear you hear different ideas about the sometimes I hear an idea like them well the truth the real tradition is not like that asked
Richard ition is actually the group should even be seen ya see that the traditionally a guru is a request a married person they stay in one place they don't travel around they train you know that you're late they personally trained their disciples so that the meaningful transmission of knowledge and so on you know takes place it's not just like your name on a list and you never talk to your group would you agree with that characterization of tradition or are there other ideas about what it might be
 I think what you describe is it is an idea of a good at this is appealing to many people that to that you have a very very personal relationship to to do the pin in I'll go device in operation most gurus have been householders
 and and I think there's a lot of wisdom in that because most of the students at house
I need species here perhaps too
 code for the girl who knows what it is to to have a have a family but I'm still have a job to do have to kind of deal with all these different aspects of life that most most of us have to deal with that's it easier for such a good Route 22 then guide students with some similar kind of stage of life and of course if you'd have a a good with just a limited number of students that means that that group would actually then then kind of personally trained you say that you need to do this now or you should do less of that always been different types of Deuces Wild this kind of we could call them like Mega glue so I've been big shots Bruce Wayne
take me to go to that's that's the time you started to me by the the follow thousands of disciples works for some people want to have a good like that there are so many disciples were probably part for example
 about a thousand so disciples and get that he met maybe once or twice or sometime I've never met him but still they have so much love for him and if they feel that perhaps that one time when they met him and when he looked at them for a split second or something to be very very important for them
 he'll find himself is an example of that he had very little personal
Haitian sweet a personal company with his he's on Google and when he's hungry and it would be good if you'd pitch in English
 kind of like a vague his kind of life and soul my group ordered me to teach in the Western World which from outside perspective it's kind of well that's not exactly what happened but just see what happened because probably took it in that way so he's an example of a person who didn't have that much kind of personal
 painting from his crew
 but the training that he got was very important but you have a good like this just kind of jagadguru this kind of very kind of you also need to have kind
assistant Girls Aloud tradition tradition says that you should have one group who is the man that I go to the one who initiates you deeksha group is also called the one who kind of connected with the lineage but you might also have them separate and Pops multiple Chic Shugrue's are instructing groups and that's how it's worked hard times for example he would but then they would be local kind they wouldn't be called go to spell local kind of a Pepsi near devotees who didn't clean up the new ones
 and I. So so how would traditionally go device investment has often worked that you might go for example tours in Darwin to get initiated but then in your home Village still be another person who trained you off but each villager
attend some big male has some big festivals in here from a guru and go into some tent and be initiated into the lineage and given the monster by then but when they go back to their own village someone may be another disciple of that Guru who's there and in their locality is going to be giving them more practical instruction exactly like like we're not going to come together at Raphael Tara
 and then after that would be dispersed the game the different directions but they'll be somebody there to kind of nauseous that would be
 I suppose ideally or perhaps necessarily teaching in alignment with their their dick sugar definitely really being kind of disciple of the same diksha group but a teaching the same thing
you know what you're bringing up is. Just bring the Santa really I'll just bring this home offer fruit for people like myself and rug or not to we found that the people that were connecting
 with you know the people that are connecting with us that blue well let me put it this way let me go back a bit when Rogan often I first got involved in practicing bhakti
 we knew our girl and they know us personally we would have time to spend with them we get directions directions from them
 if they had like my guru head I think by the time pass when I don't think he even had a thousand disciples it was it was do you know I think he had maybe $700 800 and that seems like a lot but he was there in my life and but not only that but at that time when you got into Bocce pretty much a move
temples kind of like standard you kind of left the rest of the World Behind so when you moved in that Temple as you were mentioning there were people there to give you instructions
 when to wake up when you go to sleep what books to read books not to read how much the chant what kind of service you should do he was 12 years old you need to memorize here's what you need to know is like so you know are the way that the path is laid out in our in our in the text with in our lineage it says first there's some face and that Faith leads you to seek out the association of the other practitioners of seduce you know people that are inside of songa and then the next day after that is called touching a Korea
 where you actually really begin the practice in Earnest under the instruction you know and I'm assuming that I haven't had the fortune to read your entire book yet but you must speak about Aruba goswami is instructions
 regarding
it's from but you're asking me to send you that the universe is group artist Rye you take shelter the feet of a guru right and then is it after that as is then you get initiated by the guru and then you get instructions from the group yes the right order and so what what we see is that that was kind of provided for us very much like that whereas we worry sometimes because these people that are getting into it now beautiful sincere people
 that they get interested they're there they get their faith to get their salad song of when it comes to judging a create even if they take initiation they may not have instruction they may get the deeksha but not so much the shiksha they don't have some of their say hey you know what are you studying do you have some questions let's talk about your job to practice you know what how's that going and it in sewing to get
I would dig right into their life and in instruct them
 so I suppose that is how how one event because when we got those instructions are we just cut it was kind of like taking off you know it's like your spiritual life would really Skyrocket we want to we're trying to see what we can do so that people spiritual life don't just kind of stagnate once they get to that point so I'm a psycho and now we're done we took initiation and now we're done
 yeah I mean that's that's a very important Point insulation of course it means beginning something seems kind of the it you work yourself up to getting insulation and then you kind of done but that's definitely not not talked in the traditional seen it and I think that you're onto something very important one of the basic meaning some Buck the shedding and bought these two
something that's always done in the company of other bucktussle of the deputies and that's a big challenge for us nowadays we're spread out all over the world
 Amanda having this kind of ashram experiences as you describe them done. I also had in my youth that's not supposed to be most of us especially if we come to the later on our lives kind of an alternative for this it is very important that I think that's one of the things that you're doing what cost that's beautiful
 I swear when modern technology Lily can help us like come together with the help of two men so on like my Guru he he wants to go out the question that's what should I do I live in a place where there are no other devotees what should I do and he said move
but that's good advice but today we might not need to do that either because we we can meet each other through tune to two other kind of distress and it's not the same of course I particularly don't like eating plus adam22. It's better than nothing nothing serious plan you could you can actually we had a question asks like this just on her last question and answer. I think we're someone was in that situation we said you can take out a calendar and map out when you're going to meet with people right okay this that you know this month I'm going to go and spend some time here and I want to go on that Retreat and I'm at 10 that Festival we will have to drive three hours I let let's make sure I build very
 talk to Lee conscientiously build that kind of one-on-one time I'm willing to travel for that and sacrifice and turn my vacation into a
but otherwise there is a lot of opportunity when you're at home to it to tune into things online
 yeah there's so many wonderful things that there's one devotee with us this he has to project to go through all of them songs about cannot talk would one song every day and there's so many different things in different Cody I smell some gas today
 shorts you would let me ask you this cuz this is real important question let's say the what the the kind of model that you just shared with us a moment to go where let's say a Bengali villager would meet this big group write this kind of jug of glue famous figure kind of revered you know throughout Mangal perhaps yourself like that you know sometimes you see their posters when you drink when you're driving the person in that state of Indiana that area of India so they meet that person to have faith
they receive the Mantra from that person and then they're not going to have this ocean did not go there cuz it's going to have very limited contact I may be no direct maybe they got instruction through their lectures or recordings or their books or something like that but they're not going to have that one-on-one dialogue but you know with them they're going to get instructions from from from others that are following in a similar way what is the value
 in your opinion what is the value of even connecting with that more popular figure and what is the two questions in other words what is the value why wouldn't they just get initiated by that local person whose do they have to have faith in if they're receiving instructions from
 and to what is this imparting of the Mantra is it a mystical idea is it a practical idea does it have something to do with
the face of the disciple in the how would you characterize that that giving the Munch of the group gives the muncher to the disciple the disciple received the Mantra from the girl what is that really all about the questions cuz I think for the first one reason for not taking any situation from a local person might be that that person is not authorized to give initiations
 I mean that in our tradition generally don't just decide that you're going to become a group but that's a task that is given to you by your local person doesn't have that that for some reason wants to have that big big crew as they grew and that we have to be in Port we have toys remember.
value is subjective another person might think what's the point in having this this glue that doesn't even kind of know you personally but I feel like I want to be connected with this this person I want to have my connection to Krishna through this person
 other people might not understand it but I do
 this is this is this let's say that the that the disciple
 Leatherface
 that this individual
 is close to God in some way represents God in in in
 I don't know maybe more fully that there's that
bi bi that I want to connect to God through them that I have faith that that will that that's a solid connection and so that when I'm being instructed by this by the by this local Guru
 that it's some part of my being connected to this other girl reset
 yes definitely definitely and I see you said before the boat begins with faith Auto scrub top so if a particular person awakens and nurtured nutty sister faith in me and that's a good thing
 faith is it is a sacred thing and that's why we should be so careful in kind of judging other people's faith in Krishna he is not erased by something that I can't understand perhaps fully but it works for him so I think that's important as you say then the connection between the kind of
annotating Gru and Dru in Stockton group that's also has to work so the the initiating group would have to kind of authorized you are or say that yes that's a good idea to to listen to today's local what is the responsibility of the group to the disciple what when they enter into that and formalize through ceremony that's roll
 what is their responsibility to that disciple
 that's a grave responsibility because the responsibilities to delete that disciple towards Krishna and how do they do that if they're not going to be there instruction them they going to do that in two ways one is is is in directly through that in Stockton group but the other thing that brings back
this question about the imparting demantra magical thing where you asked whether that's a magical thing what it is it could be described as magical Edition describes initiation doctor the group kind of. The Mantra from his or her heart and then in part 2 the mantra
 letter to words to the ear of the disciple and then make sure that the man Christ and kind of transfer down into the heart of the disciple so so that's a powerful and and and kind of magical thing
 that ends our ordinary understanding to some extent someone might feel I'm not going to have the close association with this person but
 I received the muncher from them
 and that much will be infused
the love that they have with Krishna is is that how you would respect you because in our situation we believe this month plus are not really alive unless they are are infused with the particular power of a of a particular sit down or perfected being you just pick up a mountain out of a book that will just be dead letters well of course there's a there's a verse that quoted regarding this although I'm not sure if the the source of it is known
 well that's that's versus is attributed to the Padma purana are cherries have have accepted it as a valid teaching versus like this because many of these texts have I changed form and exactly this but this verse says
is that the Mantra which is not received from a teacher in a traditional teachers will not would not bear fruit Miss Paula
 so so that's why it's so important that that we see the Mantra from a person who has himself or herself be perfected in that month last month. Who has achieved something and who has as you say infused the demuntra with with their own feeling you can't really give something that you don't have yourself so if you don't have love for Krishna you won't be able to give that to the side to the disciples local Guru they might have the face of the disciple but they may say no no I want you to take I want you to receive this much or through this but then I'll have an easier time instructing
a dynamic potential to connect with this Mantra through someone that said that that's infused with the Bucky that were spiral important because Buck 37 a nuances
 like like you can speak about about it today people will speak about back before your concrete for example people interested in it and within that there are also kind of riotous some people love Krishna as a parent loves their child some people are Krishna as a friend loves her friend and that's why I wanted to find out what kind of interested in so so so if that were the case then then a group might even instructor disciple that I see as your spiritual life is unfolding or progressing
I'm seeing where you can get specialized instruction from another and so now I'm asking you to go and and dedicate yourself to him practicing and understanding their teachings let this person also served as you grew yes this is something that we see in the tradition and and this kind of Detachment on the other part of the guru is also an important qualification of being a glue that's not kind of being attached to riches and position and also not being attached to to the disciple in the sense that if you feel that the disciple would be more nourished by by getting specialized teaching from somebody else than the Google say go that direction.

 for a guru enjoying some other facet of the relation
then what is there the true nature of it or what is there was their responsibility but it would seem that in one sense taking on this role as a burden for the girl now I have to be responsible for your spiritual growth not just to you but to God's their heads like how I formally taken that up so if there's someone that can help me and carry part of this weight
 then I'm eager for them to jump in and help yes definitely a bit more into this That Grew if they hold that they bear that responsibility
 they then we could assume that also like there's an element of their own prayer for the benefit of the disciple that would put their orbit whether it's recalled their desire would you know that it becomes the hearts desire of the group for this person to advance or it becomes
part of their prayer that this person would have answered that might be a reason why I would want to be initiated by someone that that I'm hardly ever going to get to talk to because they've purse that person is taking responsibility for my spiritual life sometimes the good results for called like the the the spiritual guide and idea being that that's that's a person who's who's gone farther than us on the parts and then who can who can hold us by the hand we live in a time which is not very good friendliness and since we were small children that we should think for ourselves and we shouldn't have any any any authorities and so on and also the internet and every small little kind of rumor growing and end
about the person whose whose father had being a disciple of Paul Brunton maybe you remember him used to write is kind of spiritual Book Center in the middle of the twentieth century is father and the son was writing about that his his conclusion was that all good news are fake and then you shouldn't have any issues which you can understand from his perspective from the bad experience he had but there's nothing that you can call fake unless there's something that's real as well that's that's very important for us to realize that just because there are cheaters just because there are people who don't live up to the expectations doesn't mean that there are no but who does
 sure and you know as you say I could imagine and I see
you know I've had for some time one foot in the Bugatti version of a world and another foot and the broader kind of Western yoga world and that world there are so many examples of collapses of big charismatic cruise that at a certain point
 almost everybody starts to get the deal with maybe that just maybe that just doesn't work in this day in age or or some similar attitude from my perspective even within my tradition I've seen the failures of it
 but I've seen so much of the success of it too is all around me and I think without that perspective but we're running out of time of the two questions I still wanted to ask you if you don't mind one of them
 is that on the district got one of those
but was it won't let me just ask the other one then and then the other one if I come to me I think I got it
 when someone searching for a guru
 what would be your advice what should they look for both on the positive and the negative like what would be the red flags and what would you instruct them you from your you know from your study into this tradition in depth
 what would we what would be perceived as red flags and what would be what would one actually really look for that they want an authentic experience
 well I think the first thing is is this is important parts of your question this is what should a person looking for a group look for and I think that's an important thing to this is actually an active thing in a huge circle to hear this statement that when the disciples that I need to go to Woodland PA
beginning to my second question which was like totally perfect hoping we could do it in like it yeah yeah you probably heard that that's when they decide that as an authentic same like would you buy a person who called himself you'll get all Metallica William Walker Atkinson an American got a new thoughts all that in the twentieth century and it's kind of dangerous ideas around agency going out and finding our group will contest it passively and wait for the Good Earth appear
 we could but I don't so that's the first thing we need to actively we need to go out and if we're interested in Krishna bhakti we should go and look among Christian about this we should we should find other people are interested interested in Krishna bhakti and
end end and speak with them ask them do they have any any suggestions but us and when we kind of growing out on understanding a back to also see that there are a variety of groups and red flags one of the things is the absence of tradition we spoke about this before the person who may seem to be excellent in other ways but doesn't have a connection and Rio collection that you see that this person has started for another Guru and is still being inspired by other groups I think that's that's a red flag
 another red flag is if the person doesn't kind of fulfill the basic requirements of glue with just having knowledge of the scriptures having Detachment to the world and it doesn't necessarily mean that you are. But who is not kind of car
attached to money to Fame The Possession the sex things like this kind of gross material things
 and then you should have some kind of attachment to back p.m. to Krishna but you can see that that person is Lili kind of living this thing it's not just T it it's not the song that person is not just a professor like me but a person who is it was actually kind of used by this thing would be absence of orbit Edition absence of a Detachment and absence of all the practice of of God Krishna bhakti important thing that the supposed to be a practitioner
 I can't help it take us a little further
we hear about the relationship between the goo and their cycle sometimes we hear about part of that goes rollers
 the kindness that they have to do disciple right could you speak to that a bit important point but it's important to realize that can take different different phone yeah might need like one of the difficult things with having a good we started suffering to bother you go to was going to tell you things that you don't like and that's why it's so much more fun to have like a book as your Guru order about having fun at the festival but it's also about struggle
 and sometimes the Google needs to to to to kind of be heavy with the disciple like Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita he starts his teaching of organized thoughts
teaching with really kind of insulting archana
 don't be such a eunuch can I be a mass murderer part is is being really nasty with him to kind of shaken to wake up from this kind of self-pity that there's going to be good with kindness might also sometimes have to be kind of heavy but sometimes it's not the group is supposed to be this nasty person who's always insulting but we need to be careful about this that we don't fall into this trap of thinking that the girl who needs to be the one who always kind of taxes on the head and and kind of it is always super super kind to us that might be a road to an inauthentic experience if that's what you're looking for or even maybe not
 explicitly or consciously or maybe you're looking for some other kind of relationship that's missing in your life where there's a father figure or or
something similar yes
 you know
 my Guru had a reputation as as as you know one that was quite
 quite ready to challenge the disciple or or or
 correct
 and in a very stirring way
 and my relationship I knew him almost since it entirely as a brahmacharya by myself he passed away just as I was changing off Tron
 Anna in for me being his disciples almost like being a marine or something like that it was you know there was orders and it was you know I would stand at attention you know when I was speaking to him it was it was very much
 I don't want to miss Cara
is it by saying it was like being in the military something but in many ways it was you know I was I would add as a as a lower ranked person in the military has to follow the orders you know I it was it was like that I felt it was incredibly good for me and it did suck so much for my spiritual life but perhaps another for another person that wasn't a Brahma Cherry it would be a different type of relationship and it wouldn't be so demanding but still this transfer could take place in the growth will take place
 that I suppose what I'm what I'm getting at is that how one Guru might relate to different disciples would be
 molded by or tape tape tailored to their circumstances
 yes yes that's that's that's one of the tasks of I suppose any good teacher that's got to be able to see the student
for where he or she is so I'm not know what kind of teaching experience don't go to different places in our lives and and we need different different teaching something's different stages and somebody who might even have to tell us that now you need to do less spiritual exercises but now you need to take care of your family and and so on so it's important I think they realize that even if we get within an institution which kind of rules that are the same for everybody they were always spice for some individual variances well and I suppose he was like an instructor in a student or parent and a child you know which the guru disciple relationship kind of shares elements from both of those after 10 years
disciple starts Earl a tomato a little bit of a different way you know he just saw that is like a common pattern and I suppose the group also maybe it has to recognize that the of this is the way it'll it'll have to deepen in another way now and end and maybe they're seeing a little bit a little bit more a little bit more like I'm treating you a little bit more like an adult or a little bit more like a friend or or if you know maybe not but these subtle
 adjustments are or adjustments may not even be the right word but it just might be a natural kind of development may may arise
