 all right here's our nugget from William
 aslett I don't know who he hits you and he was an English essay drama and literary critic painter social commentator and philosopher he is now considered one of the greatest Chris
an SES in the history of the English language
 I could be a social commentator that could add that to my title like who's not who's not I know he's a naturalist a part-time part-time a horticulturist herbologist pet lover and critic of peanut butter in the late hours nocturnal peanut butter enjoyment
 the only Vice that cannot be forgiven I was going to be what's it going to be is hypocrisy can't forgive apocracy the repentance of a hypocrite is itself apocracy what do you take away from this sir I want to hear you say well you know
it's taught through SRI chaitanya Space X to his release of course you know we in our lineage we accept SRI chaitanya as Krishna as you know Krishna has all these avatars right there's one Supreme Being a manifest in so many different ways appears in many different ways for different purposes it's interpreted powers different people in different way it's a very broad kind of theology like that but it's our faith that he came Krishna came in another form issue Tanya he had a very esoteric reason to appear but he also had this extra no reason which is to teach how to practice potty
 and
 we see through his Lila through his pastimes how this
 I did this idea that he's coming and his mood is very merciful like he's ready to it doesn't matter what you've done doesn't matter how dented a can you are doesn't matter how many bad habits you've got
that he didn't consider that
 but what really turned them off you know what he was just incredibly intolerant of was hypocrisy the pose you know it if if I have bad habits that I have struggled you know it's boy look at me I'm not like a saint or a saado I got all these bad habits my mind. I can't control my senses I'm doing this and that he's like that's okay
 we can work from that platform is no problem you know that I got you covered the way that you're feeling is actually you could do Civ you know like that that that feeling of humility you know that I'm not this great powerful Center of you know of everything that can actually work towards your damage but if your protest if you are pretending that you're not you're something that you're not if you're posing as I don't have any
those problems I'm beyond that I'm above that you don't particularly he because India and end The Vedic tradition had these clear divisions in society with the the responsibilities that each one carries as well as the Privileges that each one scares like say one is a Brahmin a or a sanyasi you know who are kind of like spiritual leaders if you're in those roles but you're not actually
 living them you know if you're not actually truly living them in your posing that way and garnering the respect that concert and then he found that to be intolerable and I don't think just because
 I think it was to teach us something that that's the greatest obstacle to our spiritual life is hypocrisy
 I love this
 are you done with that statement cuz I want to tell you
I had a run-in with a Caroline make you come back I bet you make it back okay I'll take that but what I really loved when I got into bhakti was his concept of the original there's an original there's an essence of what we are there people throw this word you got to find your authentic self and what is your event Excel what does speak of if you've been programmed in a lot of us have been programmed to make bad choices we've had some broken this we've had some trauma you've had some dents going and from those dancing from that trauma and from that Brokenness we make bad choices we develop bad habits I mean if I smoke cigarettes from that time I was twelve and and then I give it up or 10 years when I'm 30 I could feel like you're smoking cigarettes that's my authentic self that's my real self know it's not there is an authentic self
 and it's got nothing to do with with what we even think is our Earth ending so and so sometimes you need a clue to know what to look
four and solar chaitanya Sonata on Dharma viticulture gives a clue what is underneath everything and sometimes in our in our in our in our search for that authenticity we might even take it to a bodily level we might take it to a you know Muhammad Ali and I got to get back to my Italian Roots know there is something even more subtle than flesh there's something more subtle than mind and that spirit so when we won when we when we don't want to be hypocritical and when we don't want to be pretentious and when we don't want to be you know putting on a front
 we have to find out what we really are so we tried it like talk ourselves backwards what am I authenticate and you can't know that unless you know what you actually are you can't you got to talk
ourselves back to the original and what are we we are a tiny part of God part of something bigger we are Eternal we're filled with joy we have inherent wisdom and to get that we have to cultivate in the same way you cultivate a fire from a from having a little match you need to put the proper tender on and the proper then kindling on and then eventually the bigger logs on and that will start to come out so much about this in the terminology you like that thing
 but it so it's our son the bhakti that made makes our inner self come out that is our authentic self and now it seems so far and I'm just having this thing with my son you know I had my 10 year-old I had to give him the whole lecture because he just you know he's born in this age where everyone every things a video
that's just like listen I want you to read for an hour a day we started off slow and then we just put one hour a day he just didn't want to do it so I had to get in the whole lecture on you know they say in India what tastes bitter at first becomes very sweet and what tastes very sweet at first becomes bitter right real life examples how does it feel if you eat too much candy has it feel if you watch cuz he'll be honest you'll say something like I watched I was I was just saying I've been on the screen too long we spend way too much time on the screen like as soon as he got the car I didn't even ask if I think it's important I didn't get that until I was 18 where I realized junk food actually makes me feel horrible you got to put that at connect those dots and so then you can connect the dots the other way putting in your time with his redundant practice or with his arm
cuz I'm reading it makes you feel better in the end it like 2 days ago now he's going to leave his first career Tom on Monday on John Maus to me he's going to do a Mahabharat to class as well
 was that maybe she's with my heart will now he's into Mahabharat trivia with me but my point is he's feeling the payoff
 putting in the time the bitter time and is coming out sweet at the end and we can talk about this I don't know I think you just wanted to talk about
 oh I do just saying how is bhakti to to manifest at authentic self we have to do and I cannot because some people say well that this is not a fit for me this bhakti thing you know why because we have no taste for it so the whole thing tastes bitter sitting in meditation controlling your senses that bitter it's bitter because we have an ill taste we have a taste for that which is not
good for us and we think that is sweet but in the long run it really punishes our health or punishes our mind it punishes and punishes our destination
 punished to come not part of the team being able to achieve the destination it doesn't want to speak of the Supreme destination
 mosquito right there and Skeeter for you I think another thing about this apocracy is it it's a face Destroyer you know
 this there's nothing that kind of it not only interferes with once I mean it's just a total blockage for one's own advancement because you're not actually dealing with the reality of where you're at but it also blocks other people's face when when they see hypocrisy so it's always revealed one way or the other and and and when it is revealed
people think all there's no truth to this you know that the people that I invested faith in all that they weren't really what I thought they were no need a stove so then take is not only a service for ourselves and our own spiritual life our own salvation or our own connection or own body but also the other people that sort of look up to us when there's people in your community that look up to you whether you believe that or not there's people that look up to you so if we're not really
 trying to be authentic as the mirror he didn't say that but I said he's more qualified you said something sweet
 the senior my son's want to serve do the humble service that's part of being a senior Vice Nova they wanted they see though
the joy of service and they said that example is so beautiful
 anyway
 that's a nice yellow dancer today yeah
 it kind of worked out what's going on with your looking or is it just can you hear me now is this couldn't just like the volume of you in the microphone or bring you the volume turned up coming out
 speaker fetty WAP so what time do the shoot my bow go in town what do you say before you said that she might buy what time which is every means of Conquest when should I be respectful of base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Rishi the super most human being and some other saraswoti the goddess of learning initial velocity of the author must appreciate
vibration h m MB say bye to you too much locate back to your property nice to keep a regular tennis in classes in the Bog of Tom and my rendering Services a devotees all that is troublesome to the 11 service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the tragical songs will be established as in a revocable fact revocable fact only got someone on this year I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their load of speed-reading from the srimad bhagavatam
 chapter can 215 r70 15 early devotees would profit started hate cancel 7 done they said they were just waiting for that stuff you need to come out
early days even chapters are coming out like the publishing the the chapters in some way in there getting spread around if I so excited yeah yeah this is Canto 7 chapter 15 text 37
 we're talking about Sydney Aziz yeah it's been talking about Gino going out leaving home find a peaceful place doing the pranayama doing the Asana leaving everything behind right as soon as he's leaving everything behind but what if you leaving things behind externally sort of but also not really living up to it can be an issue okay text 37 Sydney Aziz who first consider that the body is subject to death when it will be transport then when it will be transformed into stool worms or ashes
you again give importance to the body and glorify it as the self are to be considered the greatest
 rascals rascals room at the beginning of the senior officers would do right they're not see this body I normally were trying to make it look good and if it's starting to look good with feeling real good about it and if it's not or a little worried about it but the senior citizen this machine that I'm in right now
 it's not me and in a short time is you know animals are going to eat it and it's going to be passed through here but I'd hate her I had worms are going to devour it or it'll be burned it all just become ashes it's in here for just just a moment so we get deep into that and you live that life
 and then you begin to forget it you know you kind of already put on the clothes
and you've made that Steve shifted into that stage of life
 and a People kind of respect you for it they're going to kind of bow down a little bit when they see you okay serious serious spiritual person here who's renounce the world but then you start to turn around
 839
 Prestige is tricky it is abominable for a person living in the greenhouse. Shrum okay get ready get ready householders to give up the regular principles for a bra it's abominable for a person who go through all that for him to give up the regular principles for brahmacharya not to follow the brahmacharya vows while living under the care of the guru Pravana prostitute to live in the village and engage in so-called social activities with playing cards I don't know
kind of social roles he may just be doing business or you know whatever
 or Fresenius it to be addicted to sense gratification want to ask him this way is to be considered the lowest Renegade such a pretender is bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme personality of godhead and one should either reject him from any position or taking compassion upon Him teach him if possible to resume his original position already
 the human text 40 the human form of body
 best way to look at it the human form a body
 is meant for understanding the self and the Supreme self the Supreme personality of godhead both of whom are transcendentalist situated
 if both of them can be understood when one is purified by Advanced knowledge for what reason and for whom does a foolish greedy purse
maintain the body for son's credit vacation
 so so now it is coming on strong we're talkin about it sometimes yes you were told about it sometimes that coach has to tell you something that you don't want to hear but it's really you know to get you to rise to that to your Highest Potential and sonar to saying you know once you come to truth to turn back and walk right back into the illusion why you know why would you do that you got to try to help the person that's doing that you know Rachel this is what I got to be careful about this I can say for my own example is when I was really into my hardcore Vinyasa yoga practice it could be so driven by ego and not even in the super arrogant way but just like instead of seeing myself as a spiritual that has a body and I'm keeping this body clean and healthy so that I can serve better
 it's you get at a
text your body being able to do a certain post I can hold a handstand in the center of the room I can do a lotus in my handstand and bring it down to cook at Asana and jump back to chaturanga or I can do this with my body or that with my body and when my body is very when I don't have extra weight on I can do even more poses that I can do if I'm heavier and if I can do this and it just becomes wound up body body body body body we live in a whole society based on bodies and we're not bodies and if you hear back with him on a regular basis
 it forces you to get out of your bodily Consciousness because there is a benefit of Integrity that you get when you take care of your body when your body is healthy to eat healthy or exercise your body is stretched your body Etc but then you could cross the line where the ego is really triggered and you're like yeah look at check out my beautiful body
that is when in the name of yoga or anything for that matter we might have started out in a spiritual way doing yoga but all of a sudden we are absorbed more in the body that we were for not doing yoga so we have to be careful that yoga is actually bring us to I'm a spirit Soul I'm not a body that's the goal of yoga that is one that's the highest goal you could get to a practicing the yoga system so don't let it a trip you up cuz there's many a little there's many little potholes if not sinkholes on the path of you know you can get into like you know superhealth super helpful and get to the point where I can live wherever I can counteract disease and death and there's so many good things you can do but if you lose that Consciousness up I'm going to take care of this body but it's not even mine my it's been a gift to me so I'm going to take care of it so I can use this body to
give back that's the Perfection of yoga
 thank you baby.
 And you know I am. There's
 you know there's all these different schools of yoga you know coming out of India people that are taking this these Vedic literature as in interpreting them in different ways and drawing from them different practices and how to find those practices into different systems and then presenting those systems as you don't hear the way to practice yoga and and then you have you know what the kind of the internal debates and dialogues about what makes the most sense and why
 and
 you know like Jabba goswami is the great you know one of the six goswami Sandra David and you know the person that articulates what are lineages in in in
 most clearly you know
in that Marketplace I suppose you would call it whatever yeah and when he writes about like a stronger yoga
 you know this meditative Mystic yoga where you going deep deep State of Trance through you know yama-yama Asana pranayama excetera
 he warns against it
 but the reason that he wants it is very interesting and he says because what happens when you follow that path as you're advancing on it you developed these Mystic Powers cities
 the ability to read someone's mind the ability to control another's mind they're going to give Billy to make things just pop into your hand or a property City and just like make things appear that you took to the teacher that so much in the yoga schools nowadays to the Western that's like mythology but to the east of my Cigna know we saw
we've seen people do this we know that this can be done and if you follow that path and you begin to develop has powers from most people they're going to get lost in those powers and they're not going to follow that path to the Deep place where you find God in your own heart still get diverted just like a person's going on their spiritual path hit huge amounts of material success it can be a big diversion for you I was going to tighten to what you were saying it's just like we're kind of cruder than that we were right we don't have the ability to develop those Mists we never get that far on the pad right but we do get it's like oh we got a nicer body tracked him it's a little too sexy yeah yeah yeah and then we just lost right there a city where things are at yoga that can make Shiva lingam is kind of come out of his mouth magically I was pretty sure they're even nowadays there's people like posing that kind of
it's it's honestly kind of depressed when I'm actually I'm a little impressed but it's not the goal now it is a fake that is like you know they don't even do that for real
 I like a Christian I could fake it yeah yeah we're not impressed I saw a video of someone with a person's heart of bhakti I saw a video of someone doing a recently and you know they do this thing with a cycle why do you have the towel look like why did you receive a Legos how to listen to Magic Tricks my ten-year-old will tell you you know Lori Lori shaking her head you'll blow everybody's mind with their magic tricks he's not a Mystic it's just magic so that and let's face it if someone is faking a Mystic City this is the ultimate purport
these verses were reading right now it's like the receipts yeah Pro patch Mystic power was that he could make hippies give up sense gratification intoxication and transform them to Orthodox vaishnav us that was his Mystic powers to say what's your Mystic Powers what can you do that's what I do ya can you let a represent these teachings of them in their lives change and they realize the deeper purpose of life and experienced it cuz it transformed us it's in the process of transforming us that's how you can tell this is a mystical process
 really works you might not levitate you might not you might but you might not if that's okay your Consciousness will be transformed and it happens
 okay so so we're hearing
someone who's become hypocritical even the Judgment of it seems to be a little bit stronger here it's not even like he's kind of condemning reaching a certain plateau and turning backing and backtracking on it now he's going to give the knowledge by which one more deeply realizes the self and he's going to go to he's going to go to the zoo punish out of teachings they're going to come
 they're going to the examples of metaphors that we here in the Punisher he's going to pull them up here in elaborate on them and there's a big famous one that's coming up next is Trenton dentist who advanced in knowledge compare the body which is made by the order of the Supreme personality of godhead to acharya senses are like the horses the Mayans the master of the senses is like the reins the object of the senses are the destinations the intelligence is the chair
driver
 and Consciousness which spreads throughout the body is the cause of bondage in the material world to the Consciousness would be the actual the self and the person is sitting on the Chariot to keep the knowledge and going and they want to take this chair and drive it to these the destination of the senses so they're becoming bound
 I mean it's a beautiful way to look at it and once we do start looking at our body and our senses and our mind like a chariot we see how
 the ears want something the nose want something the eyes want something and we're all and it in what week what we call excitement
 is really just the senses being overwhelmed and we are just getting pulled around I just remember being a teenager going to New York City I was looking around and excited it seems like exciting because there is a hope to enjoy
material world is that actually tangible enjoyment it's all concocted in the mind of how you will enjoy I remember when you and me were teenagers hanging out in New York City Board we are bored hanging out but we'd have like we like living a romance of enjoying New York City number what I remember I was happy I was really happy I do have a very different way of looking at New York City now as then I get that you know imagine you're 15 years old kind of the age where you start to make your own decisions so you know yeah and then you just pop out into the middle of Manhattan and poor I fell free you know it's like now I'm pursuing what I want to pursue now I'm making my own decisions and I'm sure this before looking back at it I realized
 no I was just following the dictations of my senses in the programming of my mind's like hopelessly I wasn't free
because previously your parents at 13 your parents were your mind they said no you're not doing that that they controlled the reins of the horses you're going to school now you're getting out of school here you're going to eat at this time then you got Boy Scouts after that and then
 and now it was just the census were making those decisions yeah I was getting pulled around but I felt like freedom because my sensors are finally getting what they wanted and identified with the senses very interesting but this is like this is this classic analogy you know this is where
 the Eastern Traditions really give us so much practical
 teachings so that we don't have to accept the regulations just at face value like you do live this way or you go to hell it's more like hey let's analyze our situation in the world use your head here think about yourself right think about this analogy that the the body
take the vehicle where's the Chariot and it has these horses which represent the senses they're pulling it different directions you know the mind is like the center of all those senses where they will bind together that's the ropes that you know what they were the rain so the horses
 and do you have this aspect within your thinking capacity within your mind to reason to to to analyze you know your circumstance and what you're doing and where you're going and we called that the intellect of the intelligence and you are not even that you are the passenger on that Chariot who's either going to have to develop the intelligence to become strong enough to pull in the ropes that the intelligence is the driver
 you're either going to have to develop a strong intelligence that can control the mind and senses and then you'll be able to choose your direction very that the highest destiny
very clearly you'll be able to direct it that way if you don't if you don't develop that kind of clear reasoning you are destined to be pulled Amos Lee. That's what will happen think about that and when you so when we talk about these regulations is yogic regulations controlling the mind and senses and regulating your diet regulating at your sexuality regulating all these other things to think of it like this don't you think simple bad thank you am I free or am I being controlled do a my directing my life or am I getting pulled aimlessly by wild horses that's the context that you understand and it becomes a very powerful
 contemplation of the good results come from the discipline
 then we start to realize our real best interest are real authentic self wants the best for us wants us to be joyful wants us to be not want to be beat up by
she's like almost like our senses beat us up to them people like after vacation they're like oh man I got to get back to some yoga practice but I went ahead and cruise I ate I overate I know I partied a little bit too much I didn't do any yoga it's like you need a vacation from your vacation at Club Bogota go so yeah let me start to realize that all these parameters or guard rails were putting up there not too they're not to harm us at all there to give us more freedom connect with the how to self actually enjoys and then there's a very very deep connection with self when we realized this is actually the now I can actually connect with South with sourcenow meditation makes more sense people all the time want to do whatever they want
 and therefore let them I say all you do and I'm going to throw in some meditation in there too it's not going to be it'll be good it's not going to be as effective
because when we're in involving Scott's gratification on a regular basis we're living in the mind we're hoping to enjoy this hope it's creating mental concoctions of enjoyment in the mind most of it's not tangible enjoyment it's a hope to enjoy I'm going to get this I'm going to go here I'm going to do this and it just living in the mind to win them sit for meditation or a holy name it's very difficult to be here now you just been all the time stirring up your mind
 and I are going to try to sit down to have a settled mind in and now the whole thing still spinning you know what I love the 50s I'm in the office right now, because I thought you might like the fifties like you know the 50s Elvis rock and roll 50s because a lot of it
a lot of the Pursuits $0.04 credit vacation you're either not interested in them or you just been like you know there's a huge been there done that tattoo running across your minds and your intelligence and yeah it's like it's this this knowledge can save you from the the midlife crisis
 at the midlife crisis is kind of like I never enjoyed as much as I fantasize that are joyas much in life I think I need to you know turn around and get a new car and get a new wife and get into this otherwise I'm going to miss out and it's everybody's looking at you like this guy's pitiful he should be kind of maturing in a beautiful way he should be kind of realizing deeper things about life at the station he's turning back to try to do some of those even less capable of enjoying now you know to enjoy some of those less cable
 you don't think all these like the guys being the guy don't you
this girls are interested in you should know I could pull it off this this this idea is Bogota that you brought it up you know like if you if you feel yourself caught up in certain Loops that look like this like all I'm going to join maybe it's food or maybe it's something else right and then you walk away from it with a feeling of sickness or dissatisfaction you makes you feel worse somehow oh I watched a binged on television all night I was kind of enjoying it for a while and then I wasn't even enjoying it but I'm still doing it and now I feel like crap right now I'm going to give it up I'm not going to do that anymore I've had enough of that that's Thiago that's called amazing Joy mattagami is to renounce it it's so then you pronounce it
 but then you could you find yourself back there again and then you just enjoyment or announced a enjoyment or now so that that's going through life without knowledge
the fact is is that yeah these things will make you sick and the bodies design that would like you're saying you had your 50 your body can't even do it anymore you can't eat what you used to eat this actually you don't have the power that used to have you do it in all your different you know it in terms of Athletics aren't as whatever it is that you're trying to dry out there you don't have the body to enjoy you more quickly you're going to become sick of it or it's going to be disappointing but but unless you renounce that desire unless you've analyzed that desire thought about it really looked at it and with knowledge clearly made a clear decision to let it go then you could have bounced back and forth the house cuz you don't have an alternate if you don't have a spiritual alternative you know so so the real child or the real letting go of everything is done with deep knowledge in one that knowledge is
 is it when there's something deeper behind it which we've called devotion when there's that positive spiritual beautiful devotion
an action arising in one's mind and in one's heart then actually says that that that Yaga becomes you don't even have to try you just naturally like all of these things it's not like it's not so much a struggle it's just like why would I want that when I have this talk to you
 we're practicing at bhakti yoga practice now this analogy was going to go still further we've got the Chariot which is the body we got the horses which of the senses the reins of the horses is the mind or the Manas you know that that deciding the part of the intellect that makes decisions and has its attractions in repulsion and there's the intellect the reasoning part of the minds which is the Chariot driver and then there's the self sitting on that Chariot now it's going to go still further let's keep the algae out
kinds of are acting within the body or compared to the spokes of the Chariots Wheels I'm going to
 you're riding on those hairs and right we don't look at the areas within the body but that's how do you say they live airs in the body is the errors that make you burp the air is that make you evacuate the air is that make you laugh that also allow you to open and close your eyes or to move your arms its air that's making all that happened is it interesting that there was different scientific paradigms of how the body works this one is sort of a forgotten one but it's not forgotten by Vedic teachers in teaching made it teachers and health and well-being and I are rated doctors so there's errors in the body, is a regulating SE llaman restricting of a certain are so they don't go on autopilot the 10 kinds of are acting within the body compared to the spokes
