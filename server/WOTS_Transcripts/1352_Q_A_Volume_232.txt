 it's still all right we're not going to get into this picture I sent a prayer and a shout-out to Lou from sick of it all who's got cancer from sick of it all old hardcore friend of ours
 yeah well in a prayer for a Louis from antidote is well
long-time OG with messages are going to say just people have been visiting him for people that want to know he went into a coma we we hear now that he was it was a hit-and-run accident on his bicycle he went into a coma he's been in the hot it was in a coma for very long time no longer the, but he's still I don't know exactly how you would
 classify the state that is in but it's not fully responsive you know so we're praying for him and but Dolores have been visiting him
 going to be pretty Kelly Becker thank you very pretty sure of that
 you want to hear about these sicknesses or accidents are tragedies that happen to people we love are genuinely a soft brings people together but the devotee actually looks a little deeper and says you know what
 this is me also this is it's only a matter of time
the tragedy happens to me that we are also eggshells our life is not that solid it's not iron Cast Iron and Steel we're also very delicate and this is like the stuff that keeps us fired up in our spiritual life is to understand life is opened I don't want to waste any time when I get focused on the goal of life don't want to get diverted so many ways to get diverted from our spiritual path and we only hear about these we do say prayers and we pray for connection for them but also we want to see it as I see it as it's happening to us as well this is me and in a moment not like either one of them were expecting that
 they were thinking like I'm thinking now I have forever
 anyway all right we're ready to love going out there so I'm going to read you the first question recognize okay we can
thank you sir this is coming from Ave Maria daily Zoomer so this is what you were this serious question you got some serious questions she says I recently had a reading with Ready Cash ready crave case as a friend and astrologer I want to preface this by saying this is going to sound like it's in astrology question it's really not okay when we get to the end we'll see you had a reading with ready cash one of my main reasons for the reading was for guidance regarding two of my brothers my question today is about my brother Joe Joe lives in Tennessee two years ago he called me from the ER for the emergency room very scared
 they were admitting him he's he's never married he has no kids he needed me so I went down there turned out that Joe had stage 4 colon cancer
he was totally freaked out due to some complications he stayed in the hospital for 5 months that's all I was there advocating for him the whole time since then I go down in Memphis for a few days every couple of months to lay eyes on him go to the oncologist appointments check out his food situation Etc and spend time with him thank you for doing that great sister Reddy case told me that Joe is going to need to be careful mid-july that some health issues would arise and he would need me last week you had a routine CAT scan it showed a new cancer spot on his liver
 he's scheduled for an MRI next week and an oncologist appointment in mid-july just as writing case predicted
 I'll be heading down to Memphis so that I can be at the appointment when the doctor goes over the MRI readings ready case said if that's what happens in July that's going to be something that happens in a
older and he's really going to need me at that time already case said that he thinks Joe will be open to hearing this is the this is where the kind of question opens up he says that he thinks Joe will be open to hearing about spirituality and that I should slowly start talking to Joe about Krishna Joe also has some sort of undiagnosed developmental disability he was always in the quote unquote special class in school and he has a lot of anxiety he's not always easy to talk to because of the anxiety
 this is where my question lies you ready right now can you give me some guidance on how to talk to him about Krishna I'm a little afraid it seems like a big responsibility and I don't want to do it wrong I want to help my brother without scaring him he's very afraid of death thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for the morning program and thus age groups through this you've helped me to have a deeper
ship with God and I'm truly grateful with love first of all thank you for sharing that I've been worried I love you second of all three amazing that you can be predicted stuff with astrology
 okay right that's pretty amazing I mean what would we heard their skeptic wouldn't get too excited about but never tried a case
 but next lie I was going to say you know you and I we're pretty much parkour guys became hairy krishnas we have no formal education and anyting that's jar I tried disclaimer but I said if we have a PhD in anything cuz scuba it's about explaining Krishna Consciousness to people turning right lyrics to explain it to the hardcore people that in your everyday
everyday we both explain to yoga Community you know so this is right up your alley here we're trying to create a bridge from one Island to another basically okay so so she was very honest and vulnerable so you know what I don't know how to do it and I don't want to do it wrong because there's times that we'd explain Baka to someone and it backfires it it doesn't land right and they get more turned away and you know what I was thinking would be that don't
 don't you do it but you could recommend an easy captivating read and no I'm not plugging Punk to month I don't think that. But I do think I think you should go book or you read him a journey home because they're you have
you say you know what I would love to read to you and I know because it's a tough situation for you right now I was thinking something spiritual because they say that spiritual book lower the fever of anxiety and a lot of times it's our fear and anxiety that making us suffer more than the sickness itself
 I'd even use those exact words so let's read something spiritual were together instead of just talking about how you doing how's Mom remember this let's put some time aside for every visit and it can be our personal connection and then you could read it to him or you give him an audio books reading sometimes I think me and Mara I think our strong is connection is when we say you know what let's stop and read together what do you think you think that's our strongest connection I think it's very powerful reading with someone you care about your little pet is that you do every morning where you read some do our project together and we each and do your other on this trip we've been reading a lot together
so I think that could be a valuable thing and create a real deep bond in a time of great in a time or anxieties understandable fear is understandable perhaps person loses hope living in their mind going through all the regrets what they could have done differently you know how perhaps they got themselves here and didn't take advice this is the time when she really needs you and don't just and I don't think you are because that's why you're asking this question we don't want someone to just show up for their body and well-being over that's necessary now is the time to insert a spiritual reality for them and I think that that's how I would do it because I don't find that journey home isn't sort of like now I'm going to redo the bible to read the Bhagavad Gita it's not just so we're like lucky you're a mess I'm going to take care of you with this spiritual book it's more like let's read a story together and it's filled with a lot of spiritual cues and insights
that's what I would do everything with that cuz I think that's a nice way to go of course she knows her brother better than we do and she don't don't
 you know don't be afraid to use your own intuition and your own understanding of who he is you know in and how you choose to approach him that we get it that you want some advice will share some advice but you're going to be the person that's going to know best what to do but I thought I wrote down three bullet points that I thought might be helpful a ways to explain talk to you waste explain the space that he might be open to
 and it said is that what it what they are and they're kind of basic but first one is just this idea just this life-changing idea we're not the body we're not even the mind right the mind is something that we can sit here and watch and see change we can we can watch
thoughts of fear enter the mind and then exit the mind and that's not me right that's just something that's happening inside this computer of my mind it comes in a goes we're not the body without the mind we are the Eternal spark of spiritual energy
 that's witnessing the body in mind experiencing life to the body mind but passing through different bodies that's what we are just see if that's something that that that idea interest him at this point in his experience and if it's something that he wants to explore
 so that's the first one the second one is that just speaking about life in general that
 the idea you know you can say in my own life in my own studies in my own you know in her life you know I'm really developing the space that we're here in life to learn lessons right that doesn't mean to it that that that there's something that were meant to learn and then how you explain that to him
you you have the best December. I put 22 points under that that the lessons that we learn in this life to have a lot to do with
 that there's certain things that we need to let go of
 and that there's certain things that we need to turn back to ride like we we need to let go in his case maybe you sent you know what you need to let go of fear you know you need to let go of resentment or anger or you know that things like this you know there's certain things that the way life is moving in the way that it it comes to us it can be scary but it's trying to help us let go of things and the sooner that we let go
 then then the fever goes away to you know cuz we're little cuz we're responding to the lesson this meant to be there this morning to let go ever meant to turn back you know turn back to God he returned back to our own true nature which is lying
Bernice which you know has a lot to do with
 qualities like kindness and care and love and so on that we were meant to turn back to that nature but in order to do we need to let go in a certain things we need to let go let these very difficult experiences try to understand them in the context that is nature it's God trying to help you receive the message to let go I think that's that might be helpful
 and the third one is said decide your God is in your heart and in the heart of every living being and that you can connect to God right here right like don't is it's not like it's in this book or God is very far away but the idea God is right there in your own heart
 and you can open up that conversation right now and and the more that you do the more you might actually be able to feel that in a profound way so I thought you know these are three ideas or not the body with this
spiritual energy we're here to learn lessons letting go and turning back and God is in the heart and you can connect with him right there maybe maybe you have to you have to decide of a memory if you think those are the kind of messages that would resonate with him if those might be the way to open up conversations that would be really valuable for him now. Just some ideas and advice helped found
 advise probably look a
 and when the best of luck having rain if we can help in any other way don't hesitate to reach out again she's sincere
 okay next question was a questions
 I'm going to read this to you are you going to be the next question media go ahead. This is from your friend of mine Yvette Miss Yvette from upstate New York
 over the years I have watch
people leave the path of Krishna Consciousness happens
 the prophet said don't be surprised who comes be surprised who stays don't be surprised who goes with goes oh yeah people that presented people that presented as so sincere and devoted some of which I admired for the practices they stepped away wanted to dance a little with my nice way to put it and we're not talking about are my in the mosh pit yeah when I talk about our listeners Zoomer Maya and Maya she's a ruthless dancer to not that. Both my eyes are actually difficult to tolerate and I'm working on being as tolerant as a tree but I left work to do
 is when some people choose to step away
they blame the past for being too strict or controlling and as if they were forced to do things they did not want to do
 yeah that's called blaming
 I don't see this from my perspective how ever seen this happen time and time again to people that seem to have been deeply rooted in their spiritual practice has me questioning certain things here. They have me questioning one could this happen to me like seeing this happened so often I've seen this happen so often has me fearful of losing my connection to Krishna and the devotees it has me realize that this connection like sobriety is so precious and should not be taken for granted that we can take Krishna Consciousness for granted so my gift
 to how do I remain open loving a support of the people that did step away
and are in essence attacking me now or how I'm doing it
 I didn't have reversed it
 I feel we should remain open and hope that they come back she's trying to answer herself here but I feel like we should remain open in the hopes that they come back or because regardless they are spirits holes but by Nature when someone is attacked they automatically the automatic reaction is to close off defend and protect how do we stay open when it seems counterintuitive to the question is yes
 how do we be more present and supportive than allow the space for people to share the difficult is they're having on the path before they step away like if they're really struggling how do we help them in the struggle instead of having them like shut the door on sweet baby Krishna
 I know we offer box recovery groups that is a good way save groups
another good Way Corona care that's a good way which are all wonderful resources and platforms but is there more we could all be doing on the individual level to make people feel safe thank you for your service was stupid and rub it up and Mara and much love and gratitude the three of you well sweet is that thank you for that very sincere and sometimes it's not just like confronting about wait a second that you know that it can make it it's just not confronting like these people are attacking my spiritual practice it's like it makes you think we'll be doing something wrong do they have some insight maybe I am too fanatical you know what I mean is maybe you and me been in this role playing this game for a while and we see so many since your people we've seen you know people in different ways to
drone Maya doesn't it I can feel your own if you can't do it or what makes me think I should even be doing this and we want to lower your looking for a good excuse to lower the bar okay what will let's let's let's start I don't know I'm not even sure where to start but before we get into questions 1 2 and 3
 Let's just
 I think
 I once heard a fascinating series of lectures we are Avengers for approval who it was called The Cure of Souls
 and it was based on I believe it's largely based if I remember correctly on the writings of this person named I believe his name was Anton Boyson
 yeah I remember that I do remember those lectures it had a lot to do with
people going to the Dark Night of the Soul yeah and the and the various ways that people can respond to that one way
 is that the person kind of faces their own shortcomings and confronts them and passes through them and comes out stronger and then another way was that one has fear of passing through that
 and it becomes a place where their spiritual life comes to an a roadblock or even that their sanity comes like a roadblock and
 hearing the hearing that those talks has for myself it it helped give me Allen's in which to view a lot of
 a lot of what we go to because it's basically our spiritual life doesn't mean that like you know it might be exciting and romantic in the beginning but if it's going to be real
you're going to have to confront your own dark side like any relationship right relationships yeah that happens there's he was kind of like just kind of illustrating case studies you know like common patterns and pattern that they spoke about is that if one feels I can't continue on this path
 that one way people calmly respond is that they feel like I need to tear down my judge
 right in other words it the person may not eat there may even be nobody judging them right but they make themselves they're judging themselves so there's a sense of self-loathing going on and then but they feel the need to tear down the judge and that means they need to get all vocal about the people that they were receiving instruction from
or they feel like I've got to discredit them if I'm going to otherwise I'm the problem here on found guilty I'm guilty yeah and it's so I see that happen a lot I see you know now having said that I'm not saying that the
 what's what event is speaking about your doesn't happen like I do believe I've certainly seen in but the communities that can get judgmental that can make people feel like less of a person because they're not growling a strictly and so on that is an issue it and and I like that her questions we're asking you know is there more that we can do that I think that's always important consideration we need to find that place where is it see the flip side of that and we can go back and forth on this this world is a complicated place so there's no easy answers is paresh my foot but the flip side of that is is that we live in this morning now than ever
before in like you and I've been practicing this for you nearly four decades so I think we can see Trends in society in general but like the like again with the rise of these terms like gaslighting at you do or or what's the other one spiritual bypassing but but like with gaslighting the idea in any genuine spiritual practices
 that the guide is going to instruct the student to look within themselves
 and confront their own shortcomings
 and in our world of gaslighting if we sell it all of the gas and the say I've got the problem in the first place cuz we have problems but but but
has had to be taken so that people don't feel like there is no no you are pure spark of spiritual energy and we all have these issues that we're trying to work through it and so is it's always challenging but all that being said he was a real important Point we've also been able to witness very sincere Souls pass through test like crazy
 and your he'll continue price tweet I'm convinced I believe you're convinced that when someone is determined they won't let
 and they'll kind of see these Trends in into the ups and downs you're going to face them and I'm part of that will be seeing people that you had faith in
 no longer living up to that face and that one one account is that they had to say I feel for that person I am not judge judgmental of that person but I'm not going to let it slow me down you know that doesn't change the
validity of these ancient teachings that have been handed down for centuries and centuries and centuries there's always going to be people that are following it and then going to give it up and then they're going to respond summer to respond with great humility I just couldn't live up to it you know I tried hopefully I'll try again you know can I still hang out or or or people that are going to stay like the whole thing is just a scam and it's the internet social media age you know they'll find their commiseration online
 and and then it appears oh my God this is so widespread and it's not it's just like a few people commissioning on the internet and another pattern that I commonly see is that the deeply sincere spiritual people
 is there a verse to entering into the arguments on this side it'll just seem like everyone's like saying you
hit it on the head now you're actually enlightens and end in the other and the people don't respond by saying hold it no you're accusing me of being like this look at your life is it you're the one with the serious problem here you know like it let me list all of the things that you all of you don't let me throw all your dirt out into the public Arena to discredit you like to think about the prices are going to go over there so they went with them self yeah and it's so it's one thing if people say I really had to think about my spiritual practice in and on and I'm wondering if it was actually healthy that's one thing but but and it's another thing to just like the mudslinging and it and when you see that that's a good a pretty good indicator that you may be dealing with someone that's just has their own problems and they're in there they're just mirroring that out to the world
will you act feel like you hit it on the head of the very beginning when you were talking about you got to take down the judge but there was a reason why they were attracted to it because they were struggling and they felt like they weren't living up to their Highest Potential so now they have to tear everything else or else they suffer with their so self-loathing of not being able to live up to it but the interesting thing is they actually brought that self-loathing in with them it's something they were going to carry in with them and their new set of fabricated values they don't realize that the self-loathing is is holding on tight it's sitting on their shoulders that that's not how to make sure he's going spiritual bypassing letting go of your disciplines will never give you feelings of self-worth and make self-loving go self-loathing go away just the it's Indulgence that makes self-loathing rise right and unn end in a
same vein a lot of times that kind of person comes with unrealistic expectations of the guru figure or whoever it's going to be right and in there expecting that that person is going to be there to solve all their problems and that person may not be able to solve all their problems and I can give you good spirits and structure but I can't solve all the issues that you got in your life and I'm not here to die I don't have unlimited time to spend with you and you're like no you're supposed to let you know cuz they've invested their heart in a particular way and now they didn't get their unrealistic expectation for filled and now they're lashing out that's not an uncommon happened to anyone interesting K interesting thought here Special K is
 Ian 30 years ago or 20 years ago you know to be Harry Krishna there's so many Hoops you have to jump through that people have to jump through any more you don't have to live in ashram you don't have to wear it. You don't have to like quit your job you don't these are things like it was expected when we went to Temple here's what you got
you got to stand and squat down on a toilet what does that have to do with loving God
 you just have to squat down like a like it's a toilet from you know the year of 1880 but there are there so many things like Harry Krishna 2.0 is not like that anyway so what do you want to lash out at like an institution don't think we are here waving institutional Flags or follow us or maybe places where that's what that's really happened you know when I get it but we also say God said your heart gods in your home if you don't have any part of any institution don't make your home a temple invite people over read the bhagavad-gita with them big deal if you don't have to join some church to get God
I too cuz I like Community right
 that's all okay so it's so let's get to the questions 1 2 and 3 first one is could this happen to me seeing this happened so often has me fearful of losing my connection to Christian devotees and it has me
 realize that it helps me realize that this connection like sobriety so precious and should not be taken for men
 is that because I know you personally I actually don't
 I actually don't see this happening to you and in part of the reason why is because you know part of it the whole 12-step thing is is I own my own
 you know shortcomings their program did not blame the people that come through successfully through 12 step programs you know that they've really had to confront their own shortcomings in and then they really had to let go of the idea of let me blame everyone else for my shortcomings their program to love parameters
yeah okay and so so I don't see this happening to you that but it's a healthy way to think you know that yeah I could see the world in a very different way I can lose touch this particular if I send emojis that you have is his teachings number to how do I remain open loving and supportive to people that step away and are in essence attacking my practice she goes on to say you know you you want to kind of withdraw
 if they're being critical
 well this is a this is something you have to consider very carefully if we look into the buck the teachings and even the general yoga teachings like when we look at the way that a more advanced practitioner bhakti operates is that they they've seek the shelter very Advanced devotees and they seek friendship of devotees that are kind of where they're at and the boys that are kind of coming up behind them they they're very
take me to and people that are very critical they respect them and become a bit of a distance because hearing a lot of negative talk is one thing constructive criticism is a whole nother thing but it right if it's if it's ranting and going on and on so that person feels better about tearing someone else down that's not going to help anyone so you do want to be there if you want to remain open a loving and supportive for people that are sincerely wrestling with with their faith in their issues and you can do that by you know demonstrating by speaking you know by beat being an open person and letting them feel like oh I can open up to two people
 but you do want it it could be wise to respectfully withdraw the B you do or at least or at least lay out the parameters with people like you know what you're my friend in and I'm I'm here for you and I always have been wishing you the best
enjoy your company I love your spirit but I think you're being condescending not you think you're saving me cuz scuba I don't need you to save me I'm saved and I'm embracing my Nubian but but I'm just saying I'm just saying because here's what's going on they are falling they have ripped down the court system you know what I mean they've ripped up the law books you understand I don't want I don't want you to be here for me I'm here I'm present I fully embraced myself you put yourself in a cage while she was out here for you guys. I mean I'm just saying what I'm saying their response will be they've ripped down the law books and they say you put yourself in some cage don't don't condescend me to maybe save my soul
 maybe or maybe maybe not maybe
these are the things these are the questions I always wanted an answer to these are things I always needed to talk about or something I don't know but in any case I'm saying be open be friendly communicate that be supportive but also
 Joy your own boundaries of what you're willing to hearing at you what you're willing to commiserate with her engage with and what you're not and don't don't you know say you know hey if you got constructive criticism ready to hear it but I'm not ready just here ranting going on with no purpose and that's just negative so that's I think that's important yeah I mean truth like the stupid if I was your student if you were my student like you sometimes our Master tell me if you were if anyone has come to me say rocking out to here's a deal I like this process I like a script to process a little bit formal there's a little bit too many inhibition
what do you like about it what do you like about it I like Channing but I want you to cease your answers like Shannon whenever okay and you know what I am attached to eating meat I think it's okay to eat meat I think I can drink wine with my my dinner if you were to say that to me what would I say you can't join our club and I said I think I'll have this All or Nothing mentality and then press the self-loathing button when they can't raise the bar the highest and guess what that tension will never go away and bhakti you could be following all the principals to give you this year did second initiate Vedic marriage having a temple in your home and you still feel like I'm not doing enough don't hate yourself for that it'll always be there it's their inherent in the soul to climb higher and higher and higher because we bring this lack I have no worth I'm worthless as self-loathing into a spiritual community
 then then then we go from
I Want It All is this pendulum I'm the best and I am the worst and we live like that back and forth you're my girl you're my enemy you hang up all these boundaries and I hate you yeah these kind of crazy but it's like I just think another day young one where Natalie you know you had even on on the show you had bunke just kind of opening up and say I'm a drag queen it's a very sexualize you know kind of atmosphere that I work in it's also got a lot of other kind of negative things going on there I do mushrooms or psychedelics I do them to help other people you know is that it would like okay if that's what you know it's not like we're saying stop now or you know how could you do this it was like nobody's saying you're less of a person or anything like that you know it it's kind of like
I got a 2.0 kind of community going out here so it's so there's there's many answers for the same question you can say well get walk away from that you up see how you feel if it really feel like no I've got to do a b c and d
 okay then third question was how do we be more present in support of to allow the space for people to share the difficulties they are having on the path before they step away I know we have bought to recovery groups age was Corona care what you're all wonderful resources and platforms but is there more that you could be part of this if you like we need help with this you don't need to Bella everything started with was in the stage with the podcast and then we started
this age groups in the Box recovery so we don't want to say here's here's a bunch of spiritual teachings now you're on your own we want to create a network of care so that the debauchery recovery groups are you know especially for people that have addictive behavior in this place where they can fully open up and share and and hear and feel support and those have been really effective in that and so we thank you Giovanni Martinez in all the different people that have played an important role in that age groups are specially for Sangha especially that you can meet some friends and have a space we could open up share your thoughts share your doubts ask your questions you know connect with people that's a really important part of things since age groups make that possible for people even if you're in some isolated area or something like that
 next we're trying to develop the sage Academy right we're trying to build up a like a place we can do all this
you need to learn everything you need that that's where in the works in work talk talk so getting hot on that ended things may get launched within a couple months on that and so that's exciting with my maybe get started on that we're getting a lot of help from Bonnie. No wonder we're getting house from Sue Davey and Alaska who's one of our Sage group leaders we're getting help from Thomas Hardball dog around a lot of different toys coming together to try to help build something for that so there's hopefully it'll be exciting news before the end of the summer on that
 but another thing I always wanted to go up in it and then I started to put this together the time wasn't quite right but I think now that we're getting another we have Linda Linda Linda and we're getting more organized people like she group on Easter Sunday sunny or really really stepping in and helping so there's there's this idea of sage care that there could be a team a team that includes professional counselors that are
different ways you know we have these counselors that that you know just relationship counselors end-of-life counselors you know Hospital chaplains Mental Health Care Experts so that's part of it but also just devotees that have different fields of experience in your expert at communicating and then taking a pull a safe from all the sage group members if we heard like what are the issues that you're struggling most within your own practice what are the roadblocks what are you hitting up against
 that's making it difficult for you to to to stay on this to take two tabs strong faith in to feel connected and do you know and then that team would have the kind of bomb the creativity to address that need
 in whatever way they felt would be most effective let's say a lot of our listeners are like we're parents were nude
lucky we don't know what a responsibility is to the kids let's let's create a seminar for that you know we had like amongst all these people that there's a number then they're like victims of sexual abuse is it my own fault is in my car my feel-good should I feel guilty I feel hatred I can't get it off my mind okay maybe they need to meet once a month like in a separate group with the professional counselor it than anybody in that you know maybe it's psychological I struggle with depression and I've been practicing this for a year it doesn't seem like it works for me maybe they need someone to help them out I understand in the right context and in like this you know this about 25 things that like kind of break people's practice you know like I went down a list one time you know and so 22 kind of like especially through the stage groups kind of pull these people right in and find out what are the most pressing issues in a dress him so maybe we could really develop that Sage care and ends at the resources that are that grow through that
could could help not just Our Own Canoe but can spread to wider communities to so that's one thought I've had and then I'm sure there's a lot of other good thoughts and that's great is going to develop this is this stuff's rooting down right now and I tell you it's important you know it's not easy working with groups of people but they just break off on your sleeve that Association and just say you know what I had some issues with it I feel sad and I'd like to bring this question of a bats right back to their that
 in our heart of hearts if I have any resistance and I've had in the past of people feeling like you know I've given these people everything and not not only if they stepped away is a Viper resent them and they resent me or they blaming me and so and sometimes I'll be like what I do how could I have done it different etcetera but it if if I do have some
 pain in the heart that's coming from
how dare they have done so much for them which is it almost seems like a natural response it means I'm not actually being like the Bodhi maybe they've struck a chord of my ego and I've done so much for them how dare they I have to be like hard. Stuck or hard. Praying for the people who is beating him in the streets Jesus Christ is praying for the people that are trying to kill him that's what devotees do you're not even if people hate them
 yeah rocking out he's a biggest jerk ever can't believe I fell for his stupid amongst bologna I guess what I shouldn't give resistance my mood should be like I pray for their spiritual connection if it if I've got some resistance is could have struck my ego and and people who don't endorse my ego their become my enemy they live in there they're living in a world of friends and enemies we have to be above
or else I am that I'm the thing I actually hate this is actually what we're trying to create here we're actually trying to create a club of we have no friends and enemies and there's a process to do it it's not random it's not a random I see God and everybody it's not random there's a process to develop that vision and that's what we're working at so nice I think event also there has to be some internal
 love and maybe it's love at a distance but it's a deep prayer for people spiritual connection and I like that and therefore she asked how can we be more present in more supportive what what more can we do yeah sometimes it's you can do nothing for example if somebody hates your guts you know it well that's nothing you can say no but did you can also even think of that the next person down down the app for sure but I'm just saying sometimes just people who leave bhakthi and they want to leave bhakti and they want to blame
but those people there's nothing you can say there's nothing you can offer there's no man of you can't dump a load of cash on their lap they will be like yeah you can be a million you should I give you 2 million that like when there's person who hates you nothing you do even in a kind way will actually make them happy because Envy is the big diseases of the material world that's something that not even Krishna can take away eight needs credit we meet me in tomorrow under having this talk today it needs Krishna and the help of the person to take it away it's two things from Krishna and the help of the devoted to God he has to say I want to get rid of ND in my heart
 so anyway these are like great questions but sometimes it has to be done at a distance and really just pray for people and and the real work is I find is
 how am I going to react to the way they're behaving
 when you giving a person a lot you're blah
and your life in your joint you know and you're open to thinking okay how can I do it any other way and then after while you get a little angry and you get a little resentful why why what how dare they feel that way that's when your heart has to change and say you know what I want to be Petty I really want them and I've always wanted them to be to connect on the spiritual path and I pray that they can do that and that relieves you and I find like whenever I have any resentment in the heart it's my work it's not their work it's my work
 all right brother knocked out at work had mentioned she had that resentment that hard but I'm going to put it out there cuz it may exist that's part of it she's very pure hearted good heart
 right that's it right now I guess what
I'm off tomorrow Monday all right I'll see you tomorrow I miss you guys already I Miss Mara
