okay let me know cuz I got to make my official Bob Marley Apollo yet this was serious about myself never fan don't take it personally I just never listen to Bob Marley that's just wrong well it's not wrong it just didn't happen if some people skip things I went for Bob Dylan The Sex Pistols never look back and then
 after research I realized he was a spiritual inspiration to many people claim me including Mr kosubek could be a reason why you're here I talked about it on the show
 talking about her brother very spiritual song was it called No Woman No Cry that's one of many songs you know what does that mean it means he's saying goodbye to his wife and I thought it was a woman in your life and you cry no no he's saying No Woman No Cry
SAR I don't know it's like saying no woman please don't cry that's what it takes to Ziggy to the entire family I judged harshly cuz he smokes a lot of reefer okay and are you going to make an apology to Mr with another George Harrison shaking hands with Bob Marley and I don't have the
I thought I know we appreciate the apology right as far as I'm concerned you're clean socks kids with cycling with practice like a David the guy in that sense like he was world-famous he was he was like you know he was he had a spiritual conception you know something amazing what people do anything maybe 20 kids from many different women just saying that's a false problem perhaps give me the shovel
hahaha a person for their music or you love them cuz they're a great football star and charismatic are you 11 because you're a great comedian and they were they Love Bob Marley because it was hard cuz he was a good-hearted person and express it to his music
 cuz I'm a little angry that we're going to leave it there for today. Glad gangster rap Gangster Rap God conscious and it came through his music station I was listening to this song and when I got proposed books like
 like
the science of self-realization in different books at that was speaking in a in a way that way in a manner that was very similar to Bob Marley or vice versa you know it the way that he expressed himself in many ways to remind me about Marley and I bet if I read you some of those quotes at this point it's Bob Marley Bob Marley. Ok
 I hope you feel better. A lot of good naggatz I could find some Bob Marley I want you guys throw some up on the board for us or put it in chat Chevy Chase

 yeah the return Messiah of the Bible okay I don't believe that but do you have to soak a nugget
 yeah there's another mrs. from Earl Nightingale
it was like yeah American radio speaker and author self-help positive I'll tell you about it so you got the whole 8:39 1889 listen to Earl Nightingale on YouTube still will they let it go I didn't even know how well he was an American radio speaker not there dealing mostly with subject of human character development motivation and meaningful existence and he was the voice during the early 1950s of Sky King the hero of a radio Adventurer series and was a w g n radio program hosts
 okay WGN in Chicago Chicago Pride here Nightingale was the author of The Strangest Secret
 which kind of Terry Savage has turned one of the great motivational books
The Strangest Secret Earl Nightingale Fishel website is from his website when he was 29 Earl's Enlightenment had come to him as a bolt out of the blue while reading Think and Grow Rich I've been okay with it and it came it's not really about getting rich although that is a rich life yeah it came when he realized that the six words he read where the answer to the question I have been looking for those six words are we become what we think about think about it right out of the bag of the Gator people and then this is was his idea he realized that he had been reading the same truth over and over again from the New Testament to the works that I've ever sent in as you're saying in the biography
okay so that's why you're so why don't you wear that similar to the quote pretty much that's what we think about most of the time that's The Strangest Secret strange this is where they got the idea of that movie that's Secret
 I maybe it was one of the witch to me and I don't know much about the movie does the secret thing but from what I watch it together just you and me but from what I understand the secret is about like you think about things in the new manifest yeah and I don't know if that's exactly what I'm going to give us a and Stephanie know what the bug of agita say not but the blood of Jesus saying is that which we think about that's what we what we meditate upon in a sense that's what our world becomes too that's what we've become even to the point of we take a birth based on those thoughts are your thoughts on this and I think we got to be clear we become what we think about most
the time and in other words to me isn't it can be a little ambiguous right it happens most of the time that we would come over things I know he's just saying what we're thinking about most of the time we become their mind goes yeah I mean there's different things people focus on some people really an unhealthy way they're focused on they have perhaps an enemy in their life centered my they're always bringing it up some people are focused on you know well scanning where were they look they're seeing a hawk I turned on too well how could I turned out as well, you know if I want to date a person what is she worth you know what's her net worth some people thinking about just friendship now and some people are thinking about God and so I think or whatever finger whatever the focus is or a particular sort of musical instrument or a rock and roll whatever it is you end up that just becomes part of your life and you could see it sorted by what the picture
it but the weather pictures you have on your wall are so it starts to consume you in any either wonderful way or degrading way your world to your world gets transformed in that way in that meditation it's an actual meditation you can meditate on an enemy meditate on God you can meditate on Sports and I think even that idea that rather than just let my mind go wherever it goes I could consciously try to direct it in a to a place or in a direction that will have consequences positive or negative I could choose to direct my mind somewhere even though that's challenging right even though it's not easy even though the mind is abstinence that I could make a stance and choose that I'm going to consciously begin to direct my mind I'm going to carefully choose what I listen to what I read and what speed what I'm going to do meditation
it's a daily meditational. Cuz I'm going to do rituals in order to direct my mind is someplace that's basically it's called yoga right there okay I'm going to choose I'm I'm I'm I'm going to choose what I what I think about rather than just that the world determine what I think about now we're talkin about yoga and when it comes to text like The Bob & Tom of the bug of agita it's saying you can choose to place to to to bring your thoughts to God you think you can choose to bring your thoughts to that the highest level and that's what largely I mean that's really the essence of Akitas about is Christmas saying arjunan not only should you do your duty here but you do your duty because it just keeps your mind from wandering wherever it goes but eat so do you do but then do it thinking of me you know and if you bring your thoughts to me then you come to me and yeah and I transformed your life so you were saying that that's in the Deets and you were quoted verse 8
six and there's there's three versus there in a few that I can read them so text 527 Krishna says whoever at the end of their life quits their body remembering me alone
 and that British but your body but the body remember me alone at once change my nature of this there's no doubt whatever state of being one remembers when they quit the body that state they will attain without fail and then I always loved this first this next one there for Arjuna you should always think of me in the form of Krishna and the same time carry out what you prescribed Duty fighting with your activities dedicated to me and your mind intelligence fixed on me you will attain it without doubt he who meditates on me as a supreme personality got his mind constantly engage in remembering me on deviated from the path of Arjuna there if they are sure to reach me
I know I did a little research Runner you have I want to just some of the commentaries from the great acharya's the great mother said mud roses tell the tell people to Sunbury for their mudroom 800 years ago years ago okay it's got a big he's got a big place in Udupi Karnataka India
 is it was interesting thing about it was one of those like child's child gurus at age 12 and 14 or something like that was also it was also very very strong yeah they say he was sound like soup they said it was like they have a big deity that they worship called Udupi Krishna
is a sugar cane juice thank you they found it they found they found him in a a block of T lock it sounded like a tilak Gambia was one of these is one of the coming from one of the four of Pentacles lineages of India and he brought a lot of commentaries which I know probably used in his writings
 sugarcane juice break right when you get an Indy it's always like this guy side of the road with a grinding wheel thousands of flies all over it and I'm still I'm still thinking like I should just get it it's like rolling the dice streaking sugarcane in India
water as I can know what I'm going to get some sugar cane juice and I've been getting it every day
 did your time to find a girl says add ginger lemon tea bad for digestion
 and one of the miracle liquid are you Veda
 so they said okay so I used his commentaries when writing his commentary and that's what he says in regards to those verses we just read from Bhagavad Gita he says it is not it is not that the Supreme Lord should be meditated on only at the moment of death because the verse of saying whatever you remember the time of death retain their listen to the contrary he should be remembered recollected and contemplated upon at every moment
 okay every moment it's like the shoe Paul you seen a picture of all the time that he was thinking it would like this hatred yet
but this should be loved meditation Andy meditation Revenge meditation love
 the spirituality of the spiritual the spirituality developed
 have the spiritually developed by the spirits who developed have no such confusion as the remembrance of the Supreme Lord is the focal point of their lives and constant right to think that such remembrances to be utilized only as a one-time proposition at the moment death is an unwise consideration the scanda piranha states that there is no doubt that at the time of death is not easy to remember the Supreme Lord due to the difficulties of dying I've ever witnessed someone dying and difficulty in struggling with him and I've seen a few people that little people
stepped on the world at the time of the parts from the body one must be attuned to the Internet Internet to the word Baba means the internal conscience cuz the diversitech Bobby Bobby to her right meditation on the nature the word Papa means Eternal Consciousness the internal Consciousness is that which abides internally that's it is said that it is the nature which abides within only one contemplates something continuously does it become fixed as internal Consciousness this is what we're looking for right now we don't want to just be practicing about the in the outside we wanted to come deep deep deep within and that comes when you
play something continuously
 so only one condom play something continuously does it become fixes internal Consciousness and manifest as a part of one's nature otherwise what one would think at the moment of death will be mere Eagle related ideas from one Sone mundane empirical experiences so me and Mike using my money and I'm still a people sometimes die angry at somebody I never got him back interesting you know this is about like a focused life and you see it sometimes with people who want to become great at something a focus piano player focused we're done the player you do a focused person who's into math or engineering stuff like that often times
 the people's lives equal to their whole life
your mind is just unfocused and we're not great at anything per said we've never like a polished our cell to be something great or in fact it's getting pulled by all different influences everywhere it's a what's a speaker by turning it in not just towards being great in the material world or being evil in the material world are some great evil minds to its
 focusing just on Divinity and making that. Are you going to become like an Olympic gold medalist in God Consciousness means you have to you have to give your entire life around yeah yeah and it says like one of those things like
 you don't even go to school anymore you can like skiing school when you take the kids out of skiing
what you do with your course and then the Summer where do you go you go to the mountain where it's snowing and you're like following the snow around so you could skiing is everything and that's what it is and God Consciousness now when you say that to American they're like boring God is the only thing we know about an hour and a half on Sunday eat the waiver dipped in wine if you were lucky they dipped in the Wind on the road she got the driveway for I don't know how to use do it but that's how we did it and you know it took a lot of coaxing a lot of jelly donuts to get me go to church when I was little but I would say box he's one of the more fun things you can do. I was just thinking if I had more lives and I'm a little old and it's hard to teach Old Dogs new tricks tricks but I'm like she's supposed to drop the other night and that's what I said and I hear this
a great dancer photo focused a little and there's so many other Arts I just like dropped the ball with due to an unfocused punk rock mine of mine anyway it's not boring not in the least you know what I mean then there's like these beautiful arts like Shilpa never see generation or a dress she'll be no signs in temples and stuff like that in ancient deity how do you draw deities and sometimes these are some ways to absorb the mind but they're always some sort of mine and Krishna you playing your things to do when you're all the time whatever he at working it out
 I'm just a bad student truthfully I'm bad students it's not too late to become a good suit
Sanchez was interviewed on forgetting her name. Is this a girl
 she disciples me to Dumas swamy lives in Mondawmin
 and they're home they worship the DD of indigenous, so I think that she does Barney that she does Odysseus dance Eastern European so I interviewed her once that for the uniform I have had this website back in the day but to collect
 and she was like a super high-level odisha dancer right and I asked and she sometimes dances in the router mon Temple which is like a real honor to be asked to dance there on behalf of Krishna
so where should we were she invited but I brought a remote a while. And so I asked you what is it like to dance baradharam on
 you know ancient deity of Krishna in this very important Temple
 and she's saying it's you know such an honor and I said and then she described what it is you know dancing as Radha Rani and I said what's it like to dance and how do you prepare yourself to dance as rotten and she said to dances as krishna's not so hard you know cuz he's dances tell stories to tell the stories of Broughton Christians Lee list and she said the dance has Christians not so hard you know he's not he's doing this season that but she said what's a dance as Radha was like I was clueless as what to do you know to express her mood to Devotion to to understand it to express it she felt like a blank slate you know it's just too subtle it's just too deep and she said I had to pray for
very long time to just get to get some hints of what it is that I'm supposed to express how to express it in the stands what happened she she got that hinted she just became our inspiration but I think it's not just a dance it made her go deep deep deep into trying to understand the nature of Rod is love to understand bhakti but is but see that that art brought that it brought her to that level of meditation it brought your my goal of culture exactly. That she goes deep in her mind and then when others watch the dance that it brings their minds into Tazewell right so that's the beauty of the body called shirts if it has you it's one of the you know probably you say thank of Christian 24 hours a day it's not like you're some zombie it's actually like you're like this really looks like it does it
no but it's like you had it's a life full of Art in a life full of philosophy in a life full of culture like the beauty you like you know a life full of Dharma you know do do you like you know but it's all tied in that's the part I do they should have the soul rebels because we are counterculture kids who are rebelling against culture popular culture concept of culture sort of like why why do we have to do this cuz everybody does it mean to be some sucker them but I'm going to make my own culture it out which is the basis of culture but it's real messy culturally diverse
 it's right there is no why behind it Krishna and Foxy and emancipation of the Soul there's a y now behind culture is Hawaii behind ritual by behind
morality and ethics to bring so so that you become something most beautiful and special and that that's what it's in a couple different but there's it filled there was a film about your prompt I got his whole life in this one scene towards the end of the film where he's lying on his deathbed and he's emaciated picture of him it's not a pictures of feeling like it's a real film yeah there's a Cypress Hill Crowder up crowd around him he's at the very end
 and you know he used to always translation Bob time into a Dictaphone right and so our friend whose you had on the show for doing a boom he was the Sanskrit scholar so he's reading probably is sanskrit in the versus improper
is translating it and giving commentary on Isaiah he can barely even move his mouth and those commentaries that he gives in that final chapter just absolutely that is available on YouTube yeah I'm sure it's called what's it called that you ever will wish her the final lesson but there they show all that stuff but I don't think you hear him I think the final lesson just is just footage is just footage with music behind and if I remember correctly it's others in that scene this is a clip in that in that film you ever wish your we're
 add weight to Swami's holding the microphone and Prophets mouth is reading from the book and proper at is translating one should understand that no one is independent for everything is part and parcel of Krishna
and is acting and moving by the Supreme desire Krishna this understanding this Consciousness is Krishna Consciousness and it's so it's so it's so the idea that you had like you're saying all the culture that all the literature all the Poetry all the dance all the architecture all the cuisine or all of it is tying into this in and when you bring your Consciousness to this level you begin to see Christian is behind a bit you know we say Krishna that there's a Divine hand that's moving everything and you begin to see what you couldn't see before it all begins to make sense it all begins to click and now you're moving right in it and now you're you're seeing it everywhere you seem Christian behind everything now you're Krishna conscious all the time so he says this Consciousness this is Christian, that was beautiful yesterday you know
 the stupid was going to get the program yesterday as tired and I forgot my bead bag and I had some around such an so as all the class went to the program
nature walk back and grab my beads and then we walk down to the program and then I ran into Hari Priya and I decide to get sugar cane juice I got in there. She said what are you doing here brought us was coming at 5 minutes wait here you can walk him inside and then she'll drop us when we got off the carts everyone's have this incredible out-of-control I was dancing that Johnny B Gora and probably a quiche they had it was it was like next level he's been singing together with each other for years and years and years and then he saw me and Brace me and then you showed up out of nowhere else I called my mom I was like Maharaj
but anyway then he walked around and showed us the outside of the temple want to hear Toys R Us to plan for the other spanning it cuz there's so many people beautiful old man that was in st. Vincent's East garage and then embraced Mirage and then embrace me to you and was a great Embrace to is that you could tell the guy probably had nothing yeah simple person who presented is that interesting everybody's well presented meaning even if they are a lot of money or no money to show up in here just zipped up
great
 I look nice but he but the real thing was he didn't speak English so there is no verbal communication to communicate like he just loved by Schnepf is that how you felt and it was there The Shining vibrating you know kind of like you know by Senova and he got that erasing any I guess you just said at least you guys are with him then they're worth the bracelet just like a formality and Brace it was like a like let me embrace this person and feel everything inside them kind of knew it was very beautiful it was really touching
 all right I love India you ready to get into our versus for today
when should I expect the base and see if the Supreme Lord and Ryan on 29 Ryan Reese super most human being of the author I'll give it to you tomorrow okay talk to you about tonight sticky my regular tenants in classes in the baggage and room service to the pier devoting all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and let me service to the Supreme Lord who has praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact
 oh my God you're opening my eyes with torch light of knowledge I offer my own
agencies at their Lotus feet reading from the srimad bhagavatam Canto 7 chapter 1 x 16
 that sugar canes used was wonderful
 impatient and I was wondering if that was going to be so I was this pillar yesterday but when I see that sugar cane juice near electrical equipment I was okay text 16 bars you Dusty required it is very wonderful that the demon ship all merged into the body of the Supreme personality even though extremely envious so she wasn't a devotee of Krishna. He wasn't even like a yogi he hated Krishna by to is core but what's going to be revealed here
 Krishna
 is so off-the-charts Transit Dental
that if you're meditating on him your purified even if you're meditating on with hatred it's kind of like even if you hate water if you jump in a lake you're going to get wet and even if your focus with hate for Christian he's such a he's such a purifying
 horse horse thank you is such a fine for us that you were purified and he merged into the body of Christian which is the goal of many types of the oldies is to kind of like merge into God and he got that and everybody saw it everybody again we're stalking yesterday about like up until that point everybody had different conceptions out who this person is you know is he seems like a day but is he got himself is you Lord Vishnu is he a common Cowboy that somehow they got into the mix of this whole thing who is this person you know he's definitely doing some far-out things but we need to look at our lives it's not like we dropped out of the heavens we were degraded kids doing it
things are friends were degraded and defiled yeah we heard the Holy Name we heard about Krishna we talked about Krishna Krishna Prasad sewing read the Bhagavad Gita in Tamil to eat there's a Temple go to the kirtan next thing you know they're kind of merging into the body question whether it's a favorable way either to Filthy conditions Krishna is like the cleansing agent he's the vinegar that vinegar cleans things I could have said Lysol Scrubbing Bubbles for hamsters
 shampoo
 what's the birthstone of the Republic trova this one that's a fine whether you're pure n pure any state in between I think I'm slightly between Eileen
but either way whichever one it is if you're meditating on Krishna who in this verse is called Edna lochan right corner of the lotus I'd Krishna then your purified by reverse over here and got captured by Master Chief you become pure by meditating on that beautiful or with the Lotus eyes not population
 all right so that happened with with sushi probably hated to think like there are nuances way nuanced ways of becoming liberated it's not just like you going to have in your going to hell that's all those are the only options
 Ashley has many options here's the option ready this so Yu-Gi-Oh T is impossible to attain
for the great Transit Angeles how did the enemy of the Lord at a knit people work hard they sacrifice so much they renounce the world that go to meditate to try to achieve what Shish apology from criticizing
 oh great Sage we are all eager to know the cause for this mercy of the Lord I have heard that formerly a king named Vena blaspheme the Supreme personality of godhead that's a story we read earlier asking the person out of godhead and that all the brahmins consequently obliged him to go to hell Dykes go to hell Dana and we mean it how then
 did he merge every this yet she should call should also have been sent to hell how then did he merge into the Lord's existence and which might be a good time to talk about hell
because we are you doing yeah I mean you do but you can't see because you now know is there many house and many many Health millions of different house there are planets which paint there's a painful existence the only difference would that have the Christian speak it is how was it temporary place when I go in there eternally to suffer that would make God sadist not loving right so you go there you do some time to learn some lessons hopefully and then you go somewhere else that's the wheel has that wheel of samsara up and down to his many many different house according to your
 according to your desires right we desire to be interactions your actions and we can choose actions
and their temporary places where we do sometimes like a prison sometimes you get sent to Rikers Island you know what Breakers island is under a spell on Earth
 okay now so
 how did the enemy of the conversation reading right now is arjuna's elder brother the emperor Maharaj yudhistira and he's a seat he just right now just in front of everybody he just witnessed since your Palmer genders body Krishna should your pulse head is rolling around on the floor right now
 and and Christmas is peacefully sitting there and you just yours turns to Narda Mooney who's what greater Authority could we have than him and said what just happened how did he know we were all we were all just itching to cut his head off
ourselves and Christian is kind of like everybody just going to be good at taking care of and then and then Christian senses disc and then with the end they all saw that spark of spiritual energy leave the body of should fall and entering to Krishna and they know it would be too brilliant it's like you have a bright light perhaps yeah and they all saw it and so then he asked Nardo how did this happen and that's the conversation read about it he doesn't seem like he deserve that he didn't seem like he was qualified for that can you explain why he got that Marcy would be obsessed with a head
 I know if you saw the glow where the heck I'm listen beautiful instructions
thank you Mara from the very beginning of a childhood when you cannot even speak properly write like a little baby Lord Krishna and he continued to be envious of his brother the same habits so dumb to Vaca was the other one number that you gave Keepers giant Vijay birthday take birth as hiranyakashipu and
 you're sure
 yes and then if we Brothers robbana
makarna then she should apologize about this or we just told the story about ensuring that every other day that's why
 the Giant Peach eyes fall to Earth Nia buttons are on our listening I just realized that now so you guys didn't know that so quickly and Gatekeepers of a Quinta the spiritual realm you know the bouncer try to let the exclusive in to see Lord Vishnu now there's four young boys are not actually boys at all they're all old men are the first signs of Rama the four Kumar has come our means like a child at five year old and they didn't want it I get it I appreciate
they can understand what they wanted to stay five and because they just found the deal with the world's and so they stay the same they're very powerful sages and they're very connected with Lord Vishnu so they went right into my condo like it's no big deal and The Gatekeepers like where you could come and we going to see what are additional where's your parents where's your parents at next season I set up my Casey somebody's know because what happens is you go on and I'll take it anyway I just made up the story I made up the conversation I think I do completely off but it's sort of sounds good cuz I cuz I heard in the class that I was giving the students of the one you were telling us Dreamed a story that poor lad was coming back to speak to him on
Miss in Easter break so ridiculous as I can get away with my embellishments in any case that the four Kumar's were refused entry to buy contact and then Lord Vishnu came and it was the first time this song and they had this Revelation that's what took them from the impersonal realization of the absolute to the person because smell that I smelled that they all see they smell my feet of the year and that's one of my favorite paintings that one where all for Kumar's I can check them out looking at an examining my God is the creature we never seen anything like this before this bishnu they're all excited, but he's right yeah like that so so so eventually they got cursed The Gatekeepers got curse and they had to take an additional said I have to take responsibility for the behavior of these Gatekeepers they should have allowed you to win and end your curse you know will be effective
you know Mikey they have to pay and so they had to take like nine births as devotees but on our planet called Earth you might have heard of it it's like this planet is not 9 verse on Earth that place that plays them gain and loss in betrayal and romance and you know fortune and destitution please not there I said listen Okay I'm going to make a in a cut you a deal
 free verse that has demons and each time you get liberated by Lord Vishnu ever will take it will take it this is their final birth on Earth but actually
 so did so that's that's what's happening to bakra and they're actually becoming a also they weren't ordinary Kings there
the bodies from Lorde Team is happening to them
 let's get back into it I love how this back stories with everything on the Mantis
 OK Google
 19 all though although these two men shishupal is brother duntov Rucker
 a master he was by going after that
 repeatedly repeat although these two men she probably knows about her repeatedly blasphemed the Supreme personality of godhead Lord Vishnu the Supreme Ramon they are quite healthy
 in other words how would they not like lepers how would they not there wanting to get tons of Bad Karma yeah they were quite healthy good-looking L is Kings you know what's up
hours even though they were sometimes you meet people who are just so evil you're evil but you're too good-looking and handsome
 indeed their tongues were not attacked by White leprosy nor do they enter the dark as region of hellish life we are certainly most surprised by this Krishna is described by Arjuna the bug of agita 10-12 as hard on him Blah Blah by Supreme purifier here in this is confirmed via Ramon is not the cause of Krishna Krishna is the cause of
therefore Krishna is the hot tub Ramon
 people must have blown away but I like these two they are like and what is it MLK Lakshmi suprabhatam Ms Ms how was it possible for the back right in the presence of many exalted persons to enter very easily into the body of Krishna nature is difficult to attain
 the matter is undoubtedly very wonderful indeed my intelligence has become Disturbed just as the flame of a candle is disturbed by blowing winds like you know everything kind of let me know the cause of this wonderful event question cuz we're talkin to see partial it seems to be always against it
the demons seem to begin a better deal then
 Miss Mara give me a good evening
 we become what we think about
 simple straight for meditation
 our world is transformed by our meditation watch what you meditate on it
 remember God continuously with love at all times internally and externally
