frosted Pop-Tarts even worse it was like a piece of rubber sitting on top of a very gross not even whipped cream it was just some type of oily cream in the those Hostess Hostess CupCakes I thought they were the best to my mom never bought me goodies to get one of those at the trade my entire lunch to get that for one cupcake from one kid for me was a s'more you know that was considered such a delicacy and then as an adult I had was like this thing is like toasted marshmallow cotton candy
 app for Galaxy what about dots with some poisonous coloring put into up glued if it's two piece of paper
I just going to eat a bridle
 nothing good that lasted
 it's okay hun.
 I got to start it when I said pop. I shouldn't have said that you did what they have gelatin in them also be a Pop-Tarts is it from this is for Marcus Aurelius he never ate a popcorn Pop-Tart on Hast never had any product or a Little Debbie's he had like figs budget goodies at my mom would buy his like they're 99 Cents for 40
 oatmeal cream pies
you know what else was bad enough to know I don't even know which I thought was so good it was it was just like it just had like
 the feeling was so gross it was like boiled cherries in a syrupy gel
 did Marcus Aurelius had to say Marcus Aurelius hated those
 okay be right there's things that fate binds us to accept it accept them what a freedom once I accept it instead of fighting what Fate has given me accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people
 brings you together with whom people with whom Fate by
see you together fate brings you together with all types of people don't they some and some people are really great and some people are slightly painful abdomen anyway got to love them
 but do so
 with all your heart so don't have heart it just don't accept it with all your heart yep that's what I got and this is what I got to do with it you know
 there you go you know what I had I had a two-legged cat once named you shouda nicest cat in the world and it only had two front legs and this cat lived this statement by Marcus Aurelius the only had two legs was like you know what I'm going to make the best at least two likes this guy did everything you could climb atop my bed you can climb up the stairs down the stairs maybe the twolegs were a blessing you know Alexis blessing because a lot of cats are very uppity
 you know that they're the first standoffish they seem to be a consi annoyed
and it sounds like this cat was love to people whom fate brought us together with yes yes
 maybe I appreciated the help I didn't know what that we had a very sacred burial for her what did you get the wheels for it no you know what I said you know what you got no legs you're going to have to accept this in the cat was like yes except meow she accepted it but yeah. The pillow but I have to feed and clean up after
 was that after I felt like a k it's safe here if you decide to sort of scoot around the house not what we've been reading recognize we're here for the python man week we've been calling of the Python me yes and he's just yesterday we got to part where he's comparing to animal
we learn from one was the bee
 and one was a python it seems like he took the python route but but you know there's something that's being teased out you know a description we're going to hear about the python today but you know there's two ideas are being contrasted in one is you work hard for material gain that's the Bia and any he shared with us what he recognized in that was that if you work so hard beekeeper comes and takes all the money anyway so so much of what we're working for struggling for we may not even truly benefit from that's right we're talking about people thieves Rogues near Holiday Inn we members from family members with a python who the ideas are there just accepting what material gain comes
 ocean Runner
is accepting whatever material gain comes
 and why because it allows you to keep your focus on your spiritual goal and so you know Marcus Aurelius talking about the bait and I think in our culture like if you go to if you go to like all the movies we watch in the kind of stories that we get generally the hero is portrayed as the one that's changing fate right that's like actively you know fate throws them some circumstances and they're going to fight against it and try and fell for it yeah we're as in a minute there's a there's a there's a place for that in life for sure but I think from the Eastern stories
 you got another kind you also get another kind of hero and that's the one that has the power to accept their fate
 and there's a power in that you know like that there's a heroism in the
that's some that's very special and ends I guess we're hearing about that in the form of the city that is what were meant to get from this python stories not that we're just supposed to lie around but there's something and accepting one's face I'm sorry accept one's fate that's very powerful and for particular for the person that wants to practice deep spirituality it's going to save you energy how much energy can can be saved by accepting Our Fate rather than always fighting as are even complaining about it which doesn't do anything but he were kept doing it so I can live with it anyway but I may as well stop at directed towards the spiritual goals to acceptance I was trying to think of like a heroic story about that and you know what came to mine
 epic epic rock story except accepting fate grandfather be
well I was thinking I'd like to interested in modern Western culture like that but you know you know the story about these three heroic priests that were on the Titanic
 no Another Love Story there three priests I heard this before but I could have looked it up this morning there three priests their names were Joseph Benedict parachutes
 father I can't pronounce her name is Josie montavilla and father Thomas byles and I'm looking at the photos it looks like young man you know like 10 or 20 semen or maybe 30s yeah and you know there are they all chose rather than be given a seat on one of the boats they chose to go down with the ship
 and when everyone was like all running around like crazy they were like
peaceful and calming to everyone
 and their stories about them they sound like really special. These are some of the what the witnesses said
 ready yeah he said when the crash came we were thrown from our births slightly slightly dressed we prepared to find out what had happened we saw before it's coming down the passageway with his hand uplifted father biles we knew him because he had visited us several times on boarding and celebrated mass for us that very morning he is what everybody said what's going on and he's walking down that the middle Lee out any saying he's got and everything be calm my good people he said and then he went about the steerage giving Absolution and blessing you have a mass on a cruise ship that a few of us around became very excited
and I think by excited I meant like you know panicking right and then it was and then it was that the priest again raised his hand and instantly they were calm once more the passengers were immediately impressed by the absolute self-control the priest he began the recitation of the Rosary the prayers of all regardless of creed were mingled and all the responses Holy Mary were loud and strong
 there are other stories about just like how, they were how they come to others and
 and in that how heroic they were when they were offered those seats they said no no you know who they accepted the Fate they didn't try to change it even and change it like are we going to get out of this are there enough boats for everybody but buddy and then wants to let you know that the whole something freeze in the freezer
he's like a real do something it it's the things going to let you know that do you know you saw the movie that the thing starts to tell Dad
 but you know I have this crazy thing coming out here where the flight that I was on got delayed for like 18 hours
 yeah I'm going to tell you something I'm going to tell me I don't know if you remember but like like 2 years back or something I was taking a bus to go and visit you and like the bus got like a little delayed in and then it stops you know they kind of have to stop for people to take a break and go to the bathroom and whatever and I was sitting next to this guy that was just a complaining complaining complaining and he was trying to get me to kind of commiserate with him and and I was going to end
 I was expecting cuz this was a comedy of errors this flight thing was that they kept delaying it again and again and it each time was for a different reason and you know we did they didn't find another flight was supposed to be
5:30 in the afternoon and finally like 1:30 in the morning they said okay we're going tomorrow like that and end it was it was on the get on the plane get off the plane get back on the plane get back off the plane I was so impressed with the people they actually were very accepting of their fate and there were the passengers or the paperwork on the plane passengers they were actually I was very surprised how they just kind of accepted to every now and then there is like one or two people that just act it up got a little snarky year and the rest of people just kind of looked at them and then they just kind of
 all my friends become good people that they just kind of like they saw nobody else was joining in and then they just shut up
 and there was something that I was I was actually very impressed but there's something and you know what what are we going to complain about now there's where we are faded seal
in a certain sense you know like
 where will we be just have to accept what's happening and it's safe so much energy and so much negative Vibes and so much just you and how your head gets all messed up you know it did it's exhausting sure that such a spiritual person is learning how to kind of accept fate there's a balance I suppose right when other people that you have kids you know little harder and still it's the it's the fate and they got accepted you know but yes it's amazing I don't think I have hang I don't think I can handle the Titanic that well personally is just to be in here for a moment George Costanza fire II iodide identify identify as a woman or a child
yeah I mean it's hard to believe but those acts of bravery and you don't know how you're going to act you know that they say you never know how he's going to react in such a position but I can I can give some react well
 Halloween and we know that you have these mental loose about boats going down I think about it all the time so any case it will hear about this but you know let's keep this in mind let's when we hear this story let's not think so it's giving us two options one is to be industrious in life and others just to lie around now it's but the idea there's you know there's a theme how much mental energy
 could be redirected towards our spiritual or how much is wasted you know preventing us from achieving our spiritual goal that we could Preserve
through acceptance truthfully I think this whole thing complaining was a good thing to be a birthday out of this whole story to cuz I can't complain I mean you see it in the lives of people who complain on a regular basis and you have to deal with them it's like it's so exhausting if anyone's got a relative that just complain about the same thing every time you see them a situation you know their relationship with your sibling or with your you know their son-in-law's something like that it's exhausting it's like it's just stop already been planning this for forty years since his exhausting if it's his waste energy and end on that flight
 there was one person in particular
 that was it was like a young lady 20-something ish and you could just see she was in the full entitled like I can't accept
my fate mode yeah and she was like a little hyper about it and on the phone and complaining on a phone and complained everybody else and nobody was really joining in and it was kind of like everyone could kind of you could you could kind of see it in the eyes and you know in the minds of everyone it was almost like they felt sorry for her you know it was almost like this person is so
 without an unevolved I don't know what the right word is but you know like they're they're they're kind of in your sayings to become a children's right they're kind of like a child even the children are like accepting this better than this. So how much are we like that is how much of that is still in ourselves that we need to carefully observe and root out it's a big one about anything going to try that Mara except you're nothing but walk out your
door and just accept what I try to do that Cactus I never complain she's easy her she's not
 I talked about not complaining but I I complain right metallic check that with you sometimes
 rain in the musketeer 47 / what time would use every means of Conquest when should I expect to pay since he's the Supreme Lord but you're not even trying to reach you this ship knows human being until the show I was watching the goddess of learning and she'll be off today the author messed up radiation about racial Nature Republic in a sticky but regular tents in class in the Bog, and by rendering service a few devotees

I do not Endeavor to get anything but I'm satisfied with whatever is achieved in its own way if I do not get anything and patient and uneducated like a python and I lie down in this in this way for many days and okay so the python the whole thing about the python is it may go days without eating and it's not out on the hunt like like so many other creatures right like hat

summer Sidewinders Subs
 but let's not break into our part time
 you don't even know what it's called to this person studies amphibians
 education sometimes I eat very small quantity and sometimes a great quantity right up in a small birds coming by the fu versus on eating and I think people are coming and giving him food. OK Google is that are going to speak to his acceptance right I accept what food comes my way except the weather I accept you know he accepts the circumstances that come his way yeah it's like living in ashram be sure to like we're getting this today we're getting that today
I can't run to the fridge and change your your face yeah
 alright sometimes sometimes that you took a very small quantity and sometimes a great quality sometimes the food is very palatable and sometimes it's stale sometimes prashad is offered with great respect and sometimes food is given neglectfully sometimes I eat during the day and sometimes at night. We eat what is easily available he's not endeavouring sis accepting
 everybody and I'll write that was his food now we're going to get this close to cover my body I use whatever is available weather in Weatherby linen silk cotton bark or deerskin according to my destiny and I am fully satisfied and uneducated and we figured out the boxing
yeah we never to be confused about that again yeah picture of big wide coconut tree trunk and they just peel layers of it the skin right and Brennan the dry that and comes leathery and then it just aware that that
 sometimes I lie on the stand eating then we heard about is closed now we're hearing about is sleeping that's how I sleep here on the surface of the Earth sometimes sometimes I do water bad sometimes on grass or stone I just made up water bed and you said nothing sometimes and a pile of Ashes or
 might be comfortable or sometimes by the will of others and they Place us run a first-class bed with pillows
 cosentyx people giving luxury still accept that but he's not going to be attached to it the next day he may be back on it
Stone
 air hammer on us when we stay over your house sits on the floor seats right on the floor I was like my height I got to bed right here. Change of seats no thank you no thank you suck made some Val
 now hear about his I guess we've called these the what do you call it like I see gene or or you know products hygiene products hygiene products okay. I slay
 I swear Sandalwood pulp all over my body I put on the flower garlands and I dress in fine garments are ornaments to those are all good things I like flower Garland Road and it's and it's expensive. It's not easy to get I mean this is a bit of a specialty item it's considered high end especially next
then I traveled like a king on the back of an elephant on a chariot or a horse and sometimes whoever I travel naked like a person haunted by post Malon listen people like Linda Linda Linda hearing this this isn't for you just to try to absorb the essence here and I want to see you driving in on an elephant this weekend I dropped the out your or naked I don't want to see either one of those Linda just take the essence of what we're talking about here it's a long time ago she accepts six different people are are of different mentalities therefore it is not my business if I don't like this isn't what did he say again
 and he said except things to which fate bind you in any because I talk about people because like people is a whole nother category right because the other things don't have feelings but the people have feeling
so did the python has been saying I accept this external situation except that external situation but now he's talking about
 the same the same principle of acceptance or Simplicity apply to how one feels or react to other people because that's like a it's a really important world of interaction right with with
 it's how you deal with the spiritual energy first he was talking about how he deals with the material fate and now he's talking about his fate in terms of dealing with other Spirits other Souls the spiritual energy 4042 different people are of different mentalities therefore it is not my business either to praise them or to blaspheme them I only desire their welfare that's nice yeah hoping that they will agree to become one with the Super Soul the Supreme personality of godhead interesting
this what you wish then we wish them and action we wanted profile down sign his his letters you signed as he signs his letters
 mechanical sure do you know yeah you're ever well-wisher never loved with your ever well-wisher I wonder if I was in my ear Sanskrit and we're practicing not having enemies even people who don't like it when people to drive us crazy people people with different political views of us actually hurt harmed me we actually are training ourselves to be there well Wisher we're not seeing even what they're doing we're seeing that there's a soul underneath all that chaos and we wish them well we want them we want them to have spiritual connection so he's so he is saying a different people have different mentalities right I'm going to expected I'm going to bump into some people they're going to be sweet and kind
they're going to you know if we would have read more about those who wrote Grease
 those those are testimony some of them are saying like they were kind of Performing the rosary with people they were all standing around and other people were mocking them
 as if you're doing that mocking them yeah ship is going down I wouldn't have time to mock anybody it was they were mocking them even it even said they were like dancing around in a circle Mockingbird
 write a message in I can't imagine the scene and in in the priests were just like they even accepted that right like they didn't fight back and say how dare you act like that you're going to go to hell and they said that they just stayed focused on where they're at it and now it now we're hearing about this python minisink was just thinking of people that accepted their fate in a roll
and so how'd you hear about these guys I heard about it a long time while ago yeah they weren't in the movie where they the priests I don't remember I said it's been a lot of time with the musicians in that movie they just kept playing music for people like there's something in that those like what was the most beautiful life let's to spend our last moments that way you know what you think about what you think about you think about what you think about so I've been so he resent I accept that I want to meet people with different Aldi's accept that is and then he says this and is going to expand on this a bit too therefore it is not my business either to praise them or to blaspheme them
 I only desire their welfare hoping that they will agree to become and now we get to like what is freed up mental space has allowed in right like you're so much
rental space so much mental storage containers taken up with people you got issues with flick through your feed I can't believe you're supposed to stay in this especially since Pamela Harris has gone its the hate in America is Riven risen to new levels from last week have you noticed that I said I can't even look at my phone selections do that for sure. It's just so hateful and it's like when you could just let go of the hand so you know what their Spirits all their there's chaos hovering about them
 I wish them well I wish their mom is such a nice place to be you could actually become a sod of you can actually give spiritual information to people when you get the main thing the main thing so it's Obama times showing us that right that this is a person who is very consciously extremes even in terms of I'm going to free up my my mental space for deep spear
contemplation by accepting my fate and what it's worth brought him is that he feels a kind of
 a very pure kind of feelings towards other people where he's wishing he's got no enemies inside he's wishing everyone well in a genuine way in his heart and he's hoping
 that they will agree
 to become one with the super Celtic tattoo to unite with the super so right but it's okay I just hope that they will find God within themselves that's all I wish for them I don't wish that. Stop acting this way or that they would be nicer to me or that they would you know be like this for like that accept them the way they are
 and I'm wishing them do this highest spiritual connection that I feel Within Myself and therefore I wish it for others he's gone very deep for that is like wood for a lot was looking for someone that has something deep to share any found them in this is this is what this person has to share
 now he
is this song Do You Remember back a couple chapters Argonauts we were hearing about
 where's your instructions
 I forget who is giving them now
 but we're hearing instructions about how to merge your body into the elements and merge your mind into the office
 who is Hannah it was must have been it had to happen to have to do with prolonged right
 camera I forget I think it was just a two chapters back or some of that and and we're hearing how you know that you take your senses that you merge your eyes and you make them an offering to the Sun and and probably so dumb I think I have a quote here this is what it is
 is it okay if one must merge the false ego
 into the total material energy
 and then
merge the total material energy into the Supreme energetic this is the process of becoming free from Material attraction that may have been from this purport remember she'll probably had a way of explaining that
 explain that.
 The way that we're hearing this can be understood
 metaphorically
 in other which we did hear about Yogi's that actually physically like just let their body up through meditation and all the elements returned into the elements the property was saying that these instructions like let me offer
 you know all the elements within my body back into the future where they came from it and we we hear something very similar in this first bunch of rated R 43
 mental concoction of use the word discrimination
discernment write the mental condition of discernment between gold good good good and bad should be accepted as one unit very invested in the mind
 would you send be invested in the false ego interesting the false ego should be invested in the total material energy this is the process of fighting boss discrimination or false discernment this is very good in this is bad he is good he is bad they are good they are bad and we're living with that hate for the others can I read that again just to let that sink in a hate they write concoction of discrimination between good and bad should be accepted as one unit and then invested in the mind
which should then be invested in the false ego
 the false ego should be invested a total material energy this is the process of fighting boss discrimination Foster sermon okay so he sent another all that we just read about food about how he dresses about where he sleeps right other than you know the soft mattress with the pillows that's good the Hard Rock or the cold ground that's bad you know these clothes are good those clothes are bad these people that speak nice to me or good those people that are a little bit more rough with me they're bad he said you take all of that
 can you make it one unit that's just because you know another words I'm going to take all my judgment and call it judgment right Indians it's not good to have opinions
 it's not a question of not having opinions but he's saying I'm not wasting my energy on this you know you were chasing
deal with it you like out there
 what would I would say to my kids when they were little I would say make a bridge and get over it make a bridge and get over here on the bridge and get over it like you get what you get and don't be upset
 little brother
 the whole thing boils down to this deep deep acceptance of what is in God's plan and I'm just going to I'm going to tolerate it I'm going to move forward and I'm not going to I'm not going to let it show me up we have to kind of cracker or conditioning you know it's not quite so it doesn't of opinion it's the whole point is that he's he's he's been able to I'm just see what he was able to do he says okay I'm going to take all these
is about these things that are constantly changing anyway because that's the nature of the world is always going to be pleasant followed by an unpleasant that's a nature how the material energy work I'm going to shrink it down into one unit and I'm going to merge that into my mind already said the mental concoction of discrimination between good and bad should be accepted as one unit and then invested in the mind the Mind hear the Manas right this is what he says actually have the Sanskrit e r v call Pom juhu Yachats how you did that we called them the Discrimination between good and bad
 juhu yacht one should offer it settle into the into the fire of the mind I'm just going to burn it there in the mind and then come Monsieur David Byrne and the Tom that that consciousness
 Mercy in the mind then you offer that into the ego right so so another words
 all of that
good bad complaining I want this I want that I'm just going to burn it in the mind and then not mind I'm going to take it I'm going to offer to the ego and other witch who I think I am is so much related to what I like and I don't like
 right like let you know otherwise like I say this and you know they can take some how we identify what do we mean by false ego who I think I am the identity that I bought into like some people there false ego
 dictates to them
 what they've accepted as it sounds like I'm a sophisticated person
 and if someone says it like do you like it if we were to stop you once you can say like you can see yourself sophisticated or like simple down-to-earth predict things about you your likes and your dislikes like the food that you like it while I shop at The Gourmet Grocery Store I'd like to eat at the French restaurant you know other music
Black Diamond the Jazz and I'm into the classical music at Opera you know but as soon as I know I'm not supposed to give her I'm just like a down-to-earth guy you know what car you driving I drive the pickup truck you know just the fish tank I'm official kind of like a little bit avant-garde I suppose right I would say you know what you are listen to John Cougar Mellencamp I listen to you know what whatever rock and roll you know and the food there like you know I'm just happy with you know like a burger and fries you know I'm not as you send this kind of French restaurant is like what's going on here is like so expensive in this hardly anything on the plane and they try to make a little design here you know I say that to design a came here for food so the point is what we like and what we don't like is very connected to who we think we are and who we think we aren't in the but we're neither of these things these are
shifting and constant shifting from one body to another as we as we go through different bodies in life none of them have any lasting truth I'm going to take all of that I want a vested and I'm going to go for the mind to the ego and then imma take that conception myself
 and then he's I'm invested in the total material energy that's not me either it is like the 1980 kind of thing you know I'm not my life's and dislikes which is the Manas I'm not my I'm not this false conception of who I am not the sophisticated person of his down-to-earth person I'm going to burn it all I'm going to take all that's it that's all matter and I am spirit standing separate from that and he's doing this to type of meditation and he's actually cheating self-realization you know Prophet said it was a couple on couple purports to go as it was a purple to text 33 but he said the real business of life is to ask who am I and to understand one's self and through this acceptance he's been able to go into these deeper Stacy meditation and
released and separate from the Mind from the ego and then realize who he is I realize his self so it all has a purpose right all these his is his behaviour which appears kind of crazy
 when you get to know him you see wow that guy achieve the goal of life like he really understood who he is and he cheated much deeper level of Happiness sins and wisdom then then all of us that are running around
 to know the python man still of the Python man
 who do you think you are cuz Diva who you think you are what is your false ego thinking you are who do you think you are other than that that's a great one just say the people think you are usually that
I'm at you know I don't know who I am but what I do know is that a not this but I know what I'm not you know that's what is good about shaving your head I will say shaving your head is hurting like okay because you're so my identity within my hair isn't there I don't argue in the weird and the year and everything everything in life crisis
 SS interesting how much is do we invest in hair as identity is our worth as our it's a huge thing that that's why I'm pissed at yourself like
Maxwell and David Charles Wilson you're like I'm over it I'm over it people like me and the Viking and you know who else is on my side Timothy Tucker he's got good hair crochet Tanya we're living in our life it's neither good or bad it's not a good or bad it is all bad. Now let's hear a little bit more about these priests much we wrap up with that okay. We were over showing what this because you can you can imagine that these priests were living austere simple I've accepted what they got you know open them up till like this powerful kind of
