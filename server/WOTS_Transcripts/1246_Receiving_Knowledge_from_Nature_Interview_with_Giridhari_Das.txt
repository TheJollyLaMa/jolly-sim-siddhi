 it was very good and
 there's a secret I'm not allowed to announce it yet but can't say it but everybody on the message or knows all about having was released on Audible and it wasn't supposed to be released yet so nice but I got to wait to hear from the publisher if I can announce it yet it was supposed to be really something after

 I've been a big fan of his for a while come on down here and how are you how are you. Harry is bossy bossy means garage now they say that there's different types of bridge bossy summer born there and some
this is tricky microphone it's made to not pick up any other sound but the voice it's right in his we got to sit right on top of this so what's it what's the difference between a bridged bossy and a brunch of judge judge so as long as you are residing there you are actually technically considered a bridge about see if you are born there they're called the bridge on the residencia actual person so you're a bridge because I'm taking residence there's but it's from Long Island and is lifted very very interesting life and on more than one occasion he's invited me to his home and is an inborn Donovan person burn David on the banks of the yamuna and then now in rodica Limbs and now he's living here in my poor beautiful family and
 I was especially fond of him because I say 20 years ago I got really into the concept of building my own house
with natural building I've never done it now since then I've been connected with a lot of people who have done it I'm building but but this isn't conventional building its building with especially Cobb which is a combination of straw and Earth and then play sand and clay and so he's built a beautiful cob house incredibly beautiful permaculture Garden incredible a composting toilet on the banks of the yamuna everything was going great and I under was still alive at that time you and maybe 2008 or 2009 or something but we went there and you hosted us we have lunch there but then a few years later there was a big flood and it devastated your house and in your garden it was probably was a little heartbreaking
you're home I saw you become homeless and of course something that we spend so much time building designing decorating you know so much attention when you build your own house by your own hand so and then they were staggered know so everything was just under water like you note 7 ft of water was standing there even the boundary walls around though it were underwater we took a boat and crossbow under one of the rules for building cob house has Mud House is don't build it so you moved on and therefore they did it again matter fact you up cycled the windows that everything just rebuilt the same house you know like a like a child you know he's like I'm tired of this you know clay model and you soak it in the rebuild it in a different style is what we did know there's many types of natural
the building with this cop type is a specialist I find especially attracted first of all there is a cave like feeling when you're inside at the walls can be up till I can assure you can make it any size but sometimes I feel like a split or 2 ft usually 2224 in like that so it's almost as if you're in a
 how do you say it's like the one we always we always avoided it like the womb of Uma Devi the Earth goddess but also because we're in Bridge so they were like I'm but it does give you the actually that the real thing is that you have just know we had a dirt floor or third floor so you're still in contact with the earth and the walls are made of Earth so basically it's just a shelter which protects you from the excess elements you know how much rain too much heat and cold but it doesn't separate you from them you're in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and everything so you're totally intended with that way you're actually really and indoors or Outdoors you're still
spending time in nature and it's so funny how we're like the only species to say we need to get outdoors more it's like we've created this thing where they're we we we possibly live in an artificial environment we walk Barefoot if we do walk Barefoot we're walking barefoot on a rug and walking barefoot on fabricated what are they call those you miss
 call call Paul Wall in my hands called in my hands but that our connection with nature is we have a plant inside her apartment a plant a plant a tropical plant where we live and there's such a disc
we have to say things like let's go let's spend some more time Outdoors this year and we as if we become a week
 pathetic domesticated animal with where you need to go for a walk that needs to take it for a walk on a concrete pavement right like a New York City. And with that domestication comes almost like a little bit of a loss of yourself you lose a little bit of your Intuition or animal Instinct of your of your Sixth Sense is sort of gone definitely something that I even even thought about if it came up I would speak about but it is something that the time when I said this morning I sat out in the goshala so I go and sit with the cows because also this is an area like we have thousands of devotees living in the community here we have the huge Temple of men even go to the temple every day but in the goshala it's empty every single day that means a place where the cows
yeah if you don't know that they have grazing grounds for the cows and they have cows have like kind of pens but they're not tied up in a short visit like acreages of pain. Areas so the cows are wandering freely people don't go there it is the most beautiful place. It's just you just hear birds and so when I'm there you know I take off my shoes and in any way am I ever did go to the Garden afternoon anyway I'm always Outdoors at least 56 hours every day but just to Chan there it's in or getting out of my apartment that I'm renting and just go there then and there I was also feeling that to know that it really helps you to connect you know you see the clouds you can actually I'm starting to actually really feel the one that how the weather is changing I can notice it in the plants and so I actually do feel way more connected with the environment and I feel like I'm getting actually Knowledge from nature itself like actually lessons you know even about whether about health and all kinds of intuitions different things are coming to me and I really believe it's actually because like a yogi you know who's connected to
you're like you know the prom and all these things that are actually the Sun the Rays electromagnetic energy said we're in contact with them but being in our little boxes we are totally blocked off disconnected like the Omens we do we're missing on almonds or signals from nature signals from the verge of a dealer that sounds of the Wind
 so so right now you're temporarily living in an apartment apartment on the banks of the Columbia River river and from every window you look out there just Greenery there's like it's really green the last four is any way like tropical or subtropical I'm so there's a lot of plants everywhere which is one of the reasons we chose that apartment in the window facing the kitchen as you can see the river and across the river in boxing note a course house is exactly directly across so it's we still feel in was very sacred beautiful lots of birds and wildlife in a we even seen snakes go in on the wall Mongoose there
and their snake eaters they are the
 where you're working right now you're doing like a renovation for persons land and that's your lunch there and again it would it's breathtaking it's made of Earth is so it's not made up of dumb isn't as a plaster on the walls because it also it would basically need to use Earth if we wanted to Earth faster if you use pure clay tracks so we use the cow dung it also it has fiber and some insulation it is definitely nice feeling to it really nicer and nicer the feeling to it so please just call and tell them Jeremy 50/50 mix if you're new to the podcast and new to this whole
The Experience on the wall like we're talkin about this is podcasting you're hearing this for the first time that you might be taking a bath you want to share a little bit about something about cow dung because I would say civilians have no idea what you're talking about but what a channel a cow dung we're stepping most people are stepping around at not searching it out collecting it taken care of Patty's going to share a little bit about the benefits of cow dung India Indian culture always depended on the couch you know like they did consider one of the mothers you know besides the Earth and you know that the actual mother the nurse there's the seven mothers and India the cow is included as one because my mother is nourishing right she gives nourishment to the children protection and nourishment so besides milk because
as we spoke about this the other day when people saw my cow when they used to visit in the in the first question always is how much milk can a much milk are you going to get in the way and he said oh beautiful if I might just bought a second he was just like the way he was speaking stuck oh I get it the milk is actually secondary to to the cow please go on because they actually even has a farmer like you know as a person who likes to grow my own vegetables which I did when I was a vegan also before I join in so it for me vegetables were the main thing so you need money where I need to in a fertilizer so that's the first thing you know the cows to eat a lot but they turned in a grass and food fiber you know into something that's like manageable in the garden for the for the plants fertilization and you can't have you can't ever have excess of that and the cows they produce so much that it's just is so beneficial for the garden so for me the we we need a lot of vegetables but no milk
later without It ultimately I could live without and I did but the vegetables we need veggies the fruits everything depends on the cowdog so for me that was number one and I heard this that the end in Sanskrit the term butter the bottom and go over cuz governments and Goldman Scout environments actually of the first most important aspect from the cow Gober means the most important thing first thing that the cow gives is actually the milk and number two is actually you're in because they also use that in all kinds of medicine also didn't also a shocker for most people wait a second I didn't understand what you said urine or hair and you're way off track going to get out there right now
don't get milk that's another question we had we had a cow in her Bowl and Pitcher by the way squirreling back to these calls squirrel as we take a detour to squirreling back to how we're so disconnected just even the connection with the moon and the celestial bodies went because we live Upstate the first thing that people come up they say it might have to show me stars are we have no connection with the moon and the planets and we've lost we've lost that we need a moon app on our phone to tell us when I'm going on when to harvest when the changes when hybrid I've noticed in my property that there's a certain Moon maybe marizona system
that all the animals come out of hibernation like you'll be like a dead raccoon here to Dead Skunk cuz they're going to hit by a car or something cuz they're all coming out at a certain day or two days porcupines that balance and continue to do so and you have them ordered that we're catch the screens and all this depending on these machines the more that we depend on artificial intelligence we lose our own intelligence we've outsourced our intelligence without Source our intuition and it is like using crutches if you don't need them in on your legs are going to ask her if he eventually in a muscles are at your me you will become weak I like that so obviously these things you know about using artificial and it has its application but not excessively and as I said really just being in it in touch with nature and watching the animals I learned so much to learn even even this thing in the garden when I hear the squirrels and the birds are going haywire
can you can hear it that means is a predator the right so then you have to either think there's either at Mongoose or the snake say in their behavior you can see you in a mating Seasons all these things you can tell you know why it's affecting why things are affecting our Consciousness just by watching how the animals are affected bringing this on a spiritual twist cuz you're something very beautiful and very spiritual even about just working with the land and being in the land and walking barefoot in the land but as a devotee of Lord Krishna what you been for
 few decades now many decades now do you find there's a deeper pleasure any growing your own food growing your own fruits and then when I came over last time you offered me these dehydrated bananas which were quite Wonderful by the way it was him yesterday but offering your own food that you grow in your own hands
basically it's like working with other devotees to accomplish you know that asking or like let's say it's making the building so I'm the same way when I work with the plants can I plant the seed I take care of the plants I making you know help it to grow I nourish it and I can see you can see all the planets reciprocates you know they actually almost going to send to do Depends a little bit on that human judgments and nurturing but then when the thing actually bears fruit it's kind of like we did this together you know I don't think I drew this that you know it's the plant the Sun that the gods whoever's in charge of all you know all of the universal Affairs everyone took part in this and now I get to offer it so it's not just me in a feeling that I know it's like this the whole everything and it went into it until you actually feel not only happy to offer the best quality thing that you grew but you feel grateful to all the other energies everyone who else put into the plant you know to the to the rain to the
the water in the Earth and the Earth herself so the cow will help fertilize there's so many and and you actually become consciously aware that I'm not the most important person here in this equation he know she was the seat came from elsewhere and I did the job of planting with the countdown you know that was that was her job in the earth held it and then the rains so there's so much going in this like it really you know it's like teamwork Hinata please Krishna and then you're also engaging the calendar engaging all of these other entities in the service of Krishna there was a place where I heard was questions never said good morning walk so nobody asked if a flower gets offered to Krishna is that the flowers Karma like to see a divorce lawyer and he said no that is the grace of a saintly person then whatever he gets he knows how to engage in the service of Krishna and sort it feels like that also to be the one who actually goes through the process would actually takes it and on to the altar
 being able to offer so everyone who participated gets the benefit
I would say even the rain God himself is pleased that will know I did my part but you are the one who actually gave me the benefit in all innocence and official not just to the humans we reach to what is it beneficial for everyone who's involved the plant that cow that gave us the gods everyone gets benefits benefit and overall feeling of gratitude and you can't help but feel like oh I get it I'm part of something much bigger and something more subtle of the solution that I'm a controller and I look at other controllers and who built that building that's beautiful new-build disc that's beautiful and it basically boils down to this other man but then you realize when you're planting and harvesting like there is other forces here
 you know that's it as a water we can even artificially bring it there but you know I I can see now that it's warm
some of the plants just exploded sees I planted like you know three weeks ago I thought they're bad know she's your bed or dead just as soon as it rained once it warmed up now everything is snow coming to life so we you know that since you don't feel like I am to do or are you really I am dependent highly dependent on anyone on so many environmental factors which are not in my control but when they win the result is there you'll actual fruit you feel like wow it looks like it was so worth it to be able to offer this and then offer to my my friends are family because we have excess when you have a little bit of land even you can actually produce excess I have access it's not my nature to just go and sell off everything and I did I like the distributor give it a Latino share and like this dehydrate you know the excess of bananas and shared with friends that accept more excess whatever you got to do and everything going back to the cob houses there's a beauty and
 that this is a community project
and you don't have to be some it does take some like the intelligence and I'm sure you've learned how to do it better and trial and error but there's like a Simplicity of like we're building this thing with mud and get all the kids involved and get the family involved and everyone's got a seat at the table almost you know when you watch the kids they like to jump and mix them and they get bored and tired quickly but once you actually in a start digging out the little balls of the clay that we're going to start me to placing as the wall that's when they know the kids are really into it they're participating they always climb up you know I received it and start packing it down and so it's it's literally Community project and it's like Blood Sweat and Tears with a lot of blood and sweat into that little mixing and literally were sweating it's answering and so the whole thing every single square inch per millimeter of that building has been touched and Mina moved by humans who actually even worked hard
this thing put together so you can literally feel that you know the energy and it's not the same as buying the materials that are you know industrially harvested in on the Earth being mean or blowing up to get the grand night out and then sliced and then transported this is all stuff with basically doing right on the site in also sure there's no big dumpsters of waste there's no fabricated floor is no formaldehyde and which is basically we're creating a toxic world you're allowed to live in these rules about throwing out we can throw out those light bulbs you need a special permit to throw out those light bulbs you can throw out those are these things within surrounded by the elements of the earth and you can't help but now that being said it's you have electricity run electric electric
the thick walls does it keep it cool in the summer again that's that's one of the main effects of it keeps it cool and also you know I've been in this house we built it was mainly for the cool because we don't have in my poor we don't have any heavy Gold season so I didn't really don't consider to build it from warm keeping it warm in winter but if the building is made properly it's warm and in warmer in winter and cool in the summer always and they say you can maintain a temperature inside that you want and like our house in Ruther Glen we we open the windows so you know in the in the winter time you do you keep them closed in the night time you open them in the daytime get the warm air and then ramp it inside an opposite in the summer in all night you have the you know the windows open and a time we close them so we keep that in a cooler inside, and that's kind of like it's you know it really really makes a huge difference like where I've seen this I've watched you know when the temples and different concrete buildings when they switch on the fan lamp to the winter I know you can see that and I was like almost a month later when we actually start to use the fans in the warehouse
this is like it's clearing all did the temperature difference actually in such a mud building and I just want to point out the fact that I'm not nearly impressed by your building I know and I know if I could double myself I'd be doing what you're doing if I could clone myself I'm also impressed with the fact that you're one of these guys think out of the box and you said you know what
 my material way of living is over and I'm moving to India and I'm not coming back you sort of look into it when I first met you at I thought you were Indian and then if they were like that and I listen to shelter for a while I live in Long Island so you are Long Island from a Jewish Family you're not like from the 90 you're not from India or awesome or not I'll and you're like from Long Island from a in a well-to-do Jewish Family and you probably could have inherited your father's business and you just walked away from it all college Cena which is what every kid ass
do you like it's no choice like that which college you going to and then the college fairs in light in your kind of like force like go and find one quickly know cuz that's what you're going to do the rest of your life was like wow okay I'm like 18 and 17 going to do for the rest of my life moment ago you were playing with toys just a dumb kid I knew nothing and how are you going to tell him to choose choose your life no way so I am not then I thought about it my father you know we have this is a multimillion-dollar business which was started by my grandfather like started by him turn into a million dollar business my father and my uncles turned into multi-million we had cars boats everything so I thought well then why I need to go to college right now I should just join the family business sure and my father told me this when I asked him he said I wouldn't give this business to my enemy
 he said you'll get a good education and do something else with your life so really he wasn't encouraging you know I'll take it over now
he was disappointed so like someone headache and so much hard work and I'll just to maintain that so yeah wow from you is like what is he saying you know like I thought we were enjoying this is a good thing that you had a lot of money in and it's like you know already I had doubts in the American dream but that was proof that that was it that's a pretty powerful statement to get from your father because you're enjoying all the accoutrements of material success and he took care of you and we love you but it was and it wasn't even actually satisfy just that exactly that's why I thought I was like what I want to do with my life and I'm so that's when I decided not to continue with college and look around you know see what I'm going to do with my life and then after a short time of course I learned about reincarnation and Karma I heard from different people
what real-world experiences I meant Elders you know actually there was a thing when I left College I was always in my own age group not even where I grew up here not even the older kids you know one year older and 1 year younger we hardly ever makes dinner we're always with their own age groups or if it was just a bunch of immature and idiots we didn't do much we knew what we all knew what all seventeen-year-old 80 nineteen-year-olds new and finally when I left and started the Travel USA I started meeting elderly people and you don't like people who went through the sixties people who are Vietnam Vets who became hippies and but they had knowledge then they had wisdom actually his life was and it was two people are some types of people but some of them were actually wise some of them actually Seekers Mendham it is the same everywhere you go in any religion in the you know any church you'll find people who are sincerely praying to God with tears in her eyes and people are like you know I hope you going to give me that large screen TV
I've been sending quite a bit so you better just wash it off there's all types of people and then they are but it was there I learned you know that there is something higher higher Powers there's energies and they know people worshipped Davis and gods and so I kind of like you know got a mixed bag of you know how do you say really just kick tree trail mix of religions you can see where your parents you know your parents are practicing Jews thing like conservative update the file that Pappy I'm done with my smile has 13 and then I left college and is 19 okay and I travel and then and then two years two years later I was in the temple when I was 21 is
I joined because I had taken that money I did travel I met all these people I ended up in the mountains North California totally secluded place no electricity just living in a cabin there and watching the sunrise watching the sun learning about nature and and you know Solstice is better than a big step from Long Island like this is what I wanted to do my whole life you know what seems like I had when I was there I was having remembrances of dreams and and places I visited when I was young like a ranch or farm and I was like actually this is what I always wanted to be on the earth disconnected air feels more real than living in o n i a building with a c we had in our house the AC and we have the heat in the winter and now there's a hotel you can't open the windows everything is temperature climate controlled
really had some in a significant change I became way more peaceful of a healthier I mean I think for the whole one year I lived in the mountains I don't remember getting sick even once ever and before that it was have allergy season sings this that so I was really really really healthy living off of the lands and mostly organic and then my Consciousness started to when I studied yoga in that environment yoga process my mind I really started to be affected by the process of yoga and then when I read party about bhakti yoga through the bug of agita. Then I was convinced that this is the highest process for actually evolving to the Mac human can evolve to actually understand what is God and see him in every entity and every being and every particle of the creation and we will so it it was a little being in that environment obviously the song Fix You no motive goodness really helps to understand what is God's name were your parents supported or were they like what the hell are you doing professional
business from his father he's working on it with his brother he has a Jewish Family background would probably has a lot of customs and a lot of connections to how we are supposed to do things what was the pushback you got for mom or dad or brother is not really when I decided to leave College my father was against it and then I was kind of like what I'm going to do it cuz I just felt convinced that I have to actually inner inner force that was pushing me you you are right you should drop out you should search for what you want to do in your life and so my father originally was obviously against it but then I guess it was like well I'm doing this so either I can meet you like like I'm going to visit you sometime or that's it like we cut connection that I was just so convinced and I was like I'm 19 now I'm standing up for what I want to do I'm not following your path anymore I was a little rude but I felt that this is true this is real this is what I'm doing I said that in a few years later I was already convinced about
Yoga Yoga tasks I was having realizations which were I was having realizations by process and following the processes and the same things were written in books like I wasn't reading the book and then like oh yeah I know I I was having realizations and later finding this thing that I realized in that in that meditative trance is also written about hear well and sometimes some of the things came even ten years later and read about them you know so then I understood this your process actually changes the consciousness of a human being and which is the goal of human life and then which is something we have Advantage we have over plants and animals development of human consciousness is almost unlimited actually how deep and how many things we can not only learn but actually began & Beyond right there's a gal which is knowledge and Vicky on which is practical realization of the knowledge and the day you'll get a 40 of that section 8 so you can memorize in or any other religion you can memorize the scripture but it's different when you follow the process that your Consciousness actually starts these things become as we shall search up shoes
you're not you're looking through the eyes of szuster you actually see the world according to the in the description you really that is truth that is reality how powerful is Bach.
 I mean I understand the benefits of living connected with nature
 but what if I'm living in New York City and I just can't live in the Earth and Hut can't can bhakti transcend there's lots of benefits and there's lots of benefits for the environment there's a lot of benefits for my psyche there's lots of benefits for my intuition
 what if I can't do it and we were talking privately we're just hanging out some people just can't live simply people can to live in nature and I'm in many many people they want to actually you can see many City people and then they visit their Countryside is not uncommon that they love it it's beautiful but you know what I'm supposed to do here Farm the nature just said
there's no facility I haven't been raised in such a way or they just don't know how to sew I'm not I'm not saying everyone should do it but it is my life still actually I'm doing it because I liked you I didn't do it for you no teaching other people I'm not doing it to know to profess that this is the way you can save the Earth that's not my thing I'm doing it because I liked you it's soon as my heart and my mind and that's where most peaceful and most effective me and your wife were joking my Lifesaver me and your wife were joking about your son cuz your son grew up beautiful child your son grew up in for nobbin and he never went to a restaurant for came to my apartment and he couldn't understand he's 14 it right never went to a restaurant and like 9 or 10 or like why are they taking our plates
you know some people on them when they're done eating probably one of the most children children I've ever met in Western westernized in a portion of India Arie westernized the influence actually does more wisdom than even Bengali like over nothing to it sooner than the sense a little bit between the worlds become a little more International internationally since he's been here he's been he learns Bengali way better so a lot of the western kids don't learn Bengali properly he learned a lot a lot and a lot and it's quite fluent in Bengali know so Hindi
13 years old but the main thing is to the Quality he's a really nice kind-hearted person that we just first and foremost in a very straightforward honest person who are they giving for according to the Greeks it was the goal of education is to develop character okay it's the last thing if the absolute last thing I developed in junior high school character if anything I learned how to be a dirt bag and I'm still working on the characters. Just heard about Athena recently sign Chivas in the background laughing I think but it is true
 gentle if I say like nowadays that my son is gentle people be like, I'm so sorry what happened you got your
we don't have that we have another it's not a virtue is not considered a virtue and you said gentlemen's club in Apache Monical's strip joint that's what I said about the point of performing bhakti in the city or whatever so yeah I'm sorry I just wanted to say that an internal process and I know that Carl Jung he he said this he said that who looks outward sees a dream who looks in word awakens
 yeah so a T-shirt and even though if you live you learn a little bit about physics it basically said the same thing that that molecules basically you know Ben's according
what we think they're going to do that are influenced by the Consciousness by Human by invite consciousness of an animal's whatever is what countries has actually been in the material realm so it's not actually what we're seeing is actually a Dream It's kind of false in a sense when you look in where do you actually awake and when you look anywhere that's where you actually find the soul that Consciousness you know that the one who is experiencing the external World actually experienced so that's where that's where any person who lives in any any situation that's where they have to look you know for the truth is internally so it's not just a few do nature nature is an inexpensive Suffolk its mode of goodness we facilitates introspection Lucilla taste the internal a peaceful mind if it makes it easier and easier there's less but it's not good but it's not an essential ingredient in in attaining devotional service Rock the is not a new Ameri went to high school in Upstate New York
surrounded by the Catskills with the forests in the Land Conservancy used and I'm sure you could say Mara there is it's not like everyone in high school is a sage arishi Aura right there's like a bunch of good old boys going to get drunk every weekend and ride around pickup trucks with American flags hanging around the back and it's not necessarily the environment but the knowledge that we study when applied to natural living
 because quite wonderful energy actually Just Energy your body and and the international living they they join together and they just in trade create a for sexually for the body becomes more powerful more deep actually more deep and then of course all of the things that utilizing and Krishna was at the the God we worship is a country boy is Barefoot in his mother is trying to tell me how you should wear shoes you know it will the cows know where she was how can I see the undersized just goes running Barefoot through the four
he enjoys that you know eating the fruit from the trees and then there was one of the things that really attracted me to the personality of Krishna like you know I was studying yoga so I was more into him personal ID yeah you know that God is everywhere when and we are all conscious beings Eternal beings but when I heard that and you know that the actual Supreme person instead of being the god in the controller who punishes and and rewards guess you decided to like leave that to Vishnu I'm not going to do the hard work and I shall Outsource that to India
 so he decided that thing I'm just going to play I want to play I want to hang out with my friends you know my boyfriend's girlfriend's my mother and I don't know what have fun have fun and it'll be like an ordinary in this sense another my friends can climb on my shoulders in the oven reverence thing didn't even appeal to Krishna it is it is at the very least we were very interesting cool conception of higher power that are higher Powers adorable
country boy is always on vacation country toddlers always eating a sneaky he's not like this he's a liar he's a thief he breaks his promises he likes to have fun so whatever it takes
 where do I want to go next to little wing with the questions and unfortunately it always goes back to composting toilets and maybe it shouldn't be no don't go there I'm just saying it's important you gotta understand it's got to go somewhere people flush the toilet think it's going somewhere composting toilets how you doing
 talk about it okay yeah well I never this system we use always is when it was developed in India or leave because Indian people used to just go in the fields and that was their system right I mean most most people like
the world on the train you watch them as you go by and they watch you you know another train you know hundreds of passengers watching the guy passed away that was a normal thing in the disease is not clean it's obviously not that's something you do when you have 1 billion + population right or so and there was a guy who decided to think of a assistant with chicken and in the initiates in any Village and you don't need any special technique or any special materials so just make it like a honeycomb to Honeycomb tanks underground honeycomb means they have basically a tank with it everywhere every so often they have brakes that leave a gap so that the water and all that stuff escapes and gas also escapes into the Earth and we have two tanks one is a noose in the other one is laying dormant and my one tank is filled in we just switch with his wife he's going to just direct sewage to the other side and that's it and then years later you go and you can take that human who her up which is just totally devoid of bhakti
are any semblance of human human waste it says if the humans are the only ones that can't be the only species that cannot figure this out everybody out every other animal is defecating and it's working with nature somehow we're trying to chemically treat everything put it in holding tanks septic tanks septic tank they're living their septic actually completely like in a full written with bacteria and dangerous bacteria that the volume down there right right now in the Cities of Gold tanks and sewage treatment with dr. Bronner's it's done with like different chemicals that somehow we'll end up back in the water
it doesn't go away or to the ocean
 that is such a broken system do you ever feel like okay
 when this up but a feel like okay I'm doing my part I build my house out of nature have a permaculture Garden there is partner plants growing I'm taking the leaves from the trees and acting as the compost I've got worms growing and fertilizing this I'm doing everything right God will be happy but right next door
 their fracking right next door their building up an ugly apartment building or they're going to spray they're going to spray it with us and is going to come by you ever feel like what's the use of this
 do it I would never feel like what say you could at least I'm still in and majority providing my family with organic produce and also and also and an example in the sense you know but like I said I'm not I'm not going and seeing it out there I'm having Instagram account and I don't make use of these things to show what I'm doing
I'm sorry you're really missing out on a lot I thought he was going to his wife and son okay sorry go on so you're saying that I preached to them or whatever you know that they should not use chemical of course the Neighbors on the sides I do tell them I hate spray your herbicide to close to our because we have plans Heroes all right sure but it's looks kind of just out of control never goes out of control and so it again instead of like you know trying to convince everyone else to do what I'm doing and I do it so I just do it and then I'm just hoping eventually people will realize you know the actually these fruits and vegetables do taste better and actually you can just throw it out down there and it was since it is cheaper at what I've seen is in the land that we've been working which was before the owner bought it
it was obviously commercially in a commercial crops and the cash crops so that just means monocropping one particular crop that they grow in the soil is anything you plant there doesn't roll everything is just like the soil is actually dead and has no microorganisms as know that comes from them and just drink it up I previously you know what the god system is that there's like nematodes and fungal in this matter and different from the networks that actually digest the matter and they connect with the roots and they feed their nutrients from the from the decaying matter into the plants in the plants feed sugar back to the fungus A symbiosis which you know somebody had to think of your UPS are they thought about it like how do you just like to put a whole bunch of entities that can maintain each other living in harmony with each other
balance wherever we can because we can make money on it some of us and are these okay is producing great apples and put all these heavy metals on the on the Orchards and producing a great beautiful shiny apples and there's no worms and there's no pests do they have the same nutritional content these NPK nitrogen phosphorus potassium so they're just things you need to grow a plan to but I said the other day it's like in a feeding a kid white flower so is belly's full and then giving him vitamin C not supplements Lakeshore Willie growhealthy like give him a nice multivitamins you know the Flintstone of Gotham like paper and I don't think that's going to work so it's kind of the same what they're doing with the plants see not just his new three nutrients that a plant needs to look good in healthy and make it to the table but it doesn't have anal selenium is in candy
folic acid and all the things the body actually needs so that's why it runs and multivitamins right now we're eating superfoods you notice to supplement our Fascination is half of it everywhere I just harvest the leaves and dehydrate them in the powder it's so I'm getting my family in organic for my own source and that sense we use super foods are from other places or something but I think if you have to live in a city where all your produce produce is chemically fertilize chemically grown in many plays India and probably in the west so so they will grow less a mango and banana still grow them with chemical fertilizer do spray pesticide so nothing attacks it they harvest them unripe and then they take him to the distance to ship them when they're green and then hard still haven't
to the markets they spray them I think is carbonic acid which ripens in an artificially ripened and then we are children not to speak of new nutrition is so much chemicals then it's so unnatural and then waiting to talk about disease and diabetes I don't think most of them I don't think we need to have these huge huge amounts of people dying every year from all these kinds of weird diseases Guru you said such a good example you say don't quote preach to anybody but your your your example is the preaching you know Thomas said live and sometimes speak meaning your lifestyle is such a loud statement I've been inspired and I'm sure you inspired everybody today I want to thank you for coming on thanks for having me keep on doing what you're doing everybody also want to thank silver Chelsea my leg and there's a giveaway Pete bag giveaways beautiful hand-painted Krishna
