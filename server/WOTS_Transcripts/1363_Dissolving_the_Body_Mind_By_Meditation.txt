Org and you find Community picnic is on the homepage and that there it does ask you to register I don't know how much the counting of people doing that maybe just trying to get a general headcount but okay that makes sense and also only two weeks more while that discount code wods 25 is valid going to be expires July 25th to do a quick because the one you got a discount to there's only so many spaces left
 already you want to hear nugget oyster I'm down who's this from
I don't know you don't know now you know I had to do I I found this like Lion I found this cold just kind of like lying somewhere in the files in my computer and and I googled it to try to find out who said it and I came up with nothing but it sounds other take credit for it then okay it sounds to me like it was in quotation marks or somebody said but it reminds me of something wrong. I would say it reminds me of something that effort all would say that's very much
 sounds like they're kind of the way they express things but I thought both of them I think they're all so talented at expressing
 Optima Guiana or you know the discount if you punish a lot of truth about the self in your kind of clear Western modern language so this kind of caught that while I thought so let's go
 the only quotes lot in the universe
is consciousness trapped in ego-based is consciousness trapped in ego-based self-interest gradually becoming free to read that again the only planet in the universe is consciousness trapped in ego-based self-interest gradually becoming free
 it's a big one huh yeah it's big and kind of Narrows a big thing down into one sentence yeah yeah yeah the pure self the three self the spiritual self the real identity is trapped in the illusion of I me in mind is trapped in there and everything that happened to that pure self is a gift or to become liberated be bored to become free to escape the jail cell of self-interest
which ultimately caused suffering even self-interest here could have been put in quotation marks right like yeah ego-based self-interest so-called self-interest is not self-interested self-absorption divorced from the hole that's what it is itself a divorced from seeing myself as part of something much bigger know that down their self-interest divorced from the whole right you going to my car you take out spark plug in your you walk around the spark plug what is the significance of that spark plug separate from the whole what is the significance of a of a harmonium key yanked out of a harmonium has become significant when connected with the whole we are desperately trying to find validation insignificance yet still try to cut God not inviting God to the party it's his party and it's great to be a guest at it
it's great to be part of the party yeah but you isolate ourselves and it desperately search for validation from others of this world that even if you get it it will never satisfy did I watch this thing on 60 Minutes yesterday number 60 Minutes I do they have always thought they were just showing how these people born into its children born into extreme amounts of well and they did like a whole expose on it like like the air or Arris to like the Johnson & Johnson we're at at 1 to hit 21 to become multimillionaires and there's like this it is this
 it's almost like a curse from the get-go because immediately
 it's so easy to develop a arrogance and an entitlement that comes with that and it and almost like a purpose
Les Mis of having so much without ever working for it and so the living entity becomes almost intoxicated and its entitlement like that and without purpose of the universe we just become lost and floating around and we just become almost like a self-indulgent and it features becomes a sad situation and we can do that are in our own little universe as well or we just forget that we are deeply connected and that's actually what we find our joy meaning or significance our connection with our family members are our spouse our home our home actually has significance in a greater picture our family has significance in a greater picture rice ostrich like a it's a sad almost an isolated plot its app
 applauded dab platypod dad
bottom it's not a plot of reply to Destin the glory side whoever spoke this put plot the word plot in quotation marks the only plot is like just like people get caught up I mean a plot of a story
 or applied is also used as to be like a like a some kind of scheme you know to harm another right like they will they plotted this idea
 Venice in internet in a sense it's saying
 take your mind let go of the fear element in your mind you know
 and try to see what's really happening here in this world we're caught up thinking with it an ego-based self interest in other words is self-interest based on illusion itself in
we could say we would probably was always careful to he never really just said he go you know it's a false ego write an idea of a real self in the right yeah and so the false ego that the false conception the false sense of identity
 we have a self-interest based on that fault so if I think
 you know I am a man
 from this country from this family
 I begin to have self interest based on those presumptions we can take it with religion I am a part of this religion Islam is still based on this I don't have an interest based on that your people say that to you like what are you what are you into what is your religion and I always answer it say
I'm spiritual, spiritual trying to get a good point is it remember I'm a spirit and a soul I'm sure it's all I'm so sad. And we're trapped you know this also it's his Consciousness we would generally be a little bit
 to be more specific, we would say Consciousness is a symptom of the Soul
 right yeah it's not just Consciousness is this is coming all the clues are there that this is coming from someone that leans towards the the monastic kind of thinking cuz they'll just a Consciousness cuz their assumption is that Consciousness is there only is consciousness we said no there's a soul which Consciousness is they all individually have their own consciousness
is it you don't need some of it's just semantics but the semantics that we use kind of day implies certain things so we say yes we're all individual Souls with our own individual Consciousness we're all individually trapped and ego-based Confused ego-based ideas of what our self-interest is and the way that the world is coming at us sitting in the karmic reactions that were getting in the circumstances in our life are designed
 to help us become free of that entrapment what a better way to look at what a better way to frame out the world instead of like and then this happened to me the plan does apply to get at me yeah why me that's what I know I'm in Maya when I say why me and we know exactly why it's not fair it's very fair there by this it's a blessing
it's a blessing
 that being said if I see you and it hears a good thing to remember okay if I see you in pain by ship my mood should not be finally getting your car booted dude deal with it no my mood is complete compassion because she was going through it I'm so sorry what could I do to help and then when I'm ready to hear it what am I then don't know I don't have to say anything I can just say that's unfortunate that I'm so sorry you're going through this and I feel your pain but on your side you should be like it is Christmas giving me some blessing how can how can I find God's hand in this I'm when it comes to our self we can we can be like Queen Conte I'll let these let these this pain come again again what this tragedy coming again again it's a blessing and often times we do find a greatest blessing in our greatest tragedy is often made if we're really
introspective but with other people we should be very very concerned about their pain and care for their pain cuz we're trying to develop compassion a question. It's so adorable Mara has the hiccups and she's trying to mask it but she sounds like a little like guinea pig
 a guinea pig hey are you still using that camera where that the kind of sits in the front of your screen or did you stop using that cuz you cuz you're this is this is what it's like right now it's like this the whole thing is like Mary wasn't here I don't do things that's it there tomorrow you can handle that right
 I notice these things right now cuz I'm talking to you and you're like staring off into space you know I'm staying right at your eyes
green up here okay but it's just the connection I want to feel that connection that I hold your hand a little eye to eye contact us if we can move through it like I hope we can we're going to go do some Led of stuff to get some some some sweet stuff we've been going through a lot of this kind of stuff so I think we can move over some set up a little more quickly today has really cool meditation about what time witches are very means of Conquest when should I be expecting obeisance used to the Supreme Lord and Ryan I don't you know I've been trying to reach you to see if she would be until mother starts watching the goddess of learning and Sheila vyasa Dave the author
non-stop racial population in Schaumburg about say bye to you too much low-key back to my regular tenants in class on The Bob & Tom and Jerry service De Pere to go to all this trouble from the heart will become a Raticate it and loving service to the Supreme Lord whose praise with Transit at the songs will be established as a revocable fact Beyond on Genesee street I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes of the torch light of knowledge. Probably since he's out there are you finishing my Bob Tom Canto 7 chapter 12 pack 16
 so we've heard about the codes to ethical codes of codes of living the lifestyle of the brahmacharya the celibate young Monk and we heard a bit about the greatest it to write the householder
 and now we're going to
got the Vana Presta not talked about as much
 I mean it's but this a retirement the forest it's like they're retiring to the forest of kids things get a little complicated you can't like you get stuff you just at your house we have a job when you have kids when you have sex all those things it fills up with stuff and then it's sort of like the Maha garage sale you're getting rid of everything okay I'm not going to need these toys anymore this all that these clothes are nothing and no one fits into these clothes and then you start to have hair down and invaded cultured me and Savannah are down so much you actually wandering through the floor maybe build a cottage in the forest maybe it's your simple life some people have like a Lake cottage it's like you're getting away from all the
the life and now you're going back to the essence which is okay I'm getting old my kids are grown I'm going to sit here and chant you know that's generally how I've heard it spoken about, you know say Okay husband and wife do no longer working on the work cuz the kids are grown up there taking care of the expenses husband or wife can spend more time practicing spirituality they got all day for it now they can go on pilgrimage together so you can do it this description sounds more austere than practical and send you a Sly 5 ever heard of what we're about to read it's like really austere and the next chapter is all about Cynthia's life about the final the fourth stage of life or will you just wander off and it seems to me like the difference
 and I got to go back and read the whole chapter but it seems like the Von oppressor is extremely austere but in one place and the seniority than just wanders just like never stays in the
a place you know just keeps moving always like that but let you know that we hear different descriptions that wasn't even serious we are like this for today just stays in one place the other part of her jacket area who wanders around Bahu DACA, just go like a little bit far away from the home and in in like the kids bring you meals everyday like that send me some see a bowl of cereal and bring it over tonight little cottage but this description why do we read through relatively quickly is like a real austere idea Vaughn arrested by practicing in this weather won't be any brahmacharya a strawberry has 20 a strong bond of pasta and shrimp over spaghetti sauce from one must always realized the all-pervading presence of the Supreme Lord for in this way it is
supposed to understand the absolute and we read about that verse yesterday where it really kind of hit that the whole point all of these extreme austerities and ethical codes and strict codes of living was to facilitate this Vision this idea this inside the site this ability to be able to recognize see God everywhere all the time it had said they weren't just religious rules for the sake of not committing sin they weren't just a purposeless austerities just meant to make my life miserable but they were
 design specific with a very specific purpose designed to facilitate this deeper insight into life is deeper vision of being able to see got it everywhere so this verse is kind of expanding on that sang at all of these different Ostrum it's all these different the four
stages of life we can even go back and say the four different occupations that we spoke about in the previous chapter all of the the the Apparently rigid lifestyle codes in them
 were designed to facilitate this deeper understanding about life okay seems like a good person in Vienna priced life 17 one of those retired from Family Life by rigidly following the rules and regulations for vitaprost one can easily be elevated to the upper planetary systems known as maharlika
 a person invite a project that would you live this lifestyle psych even on the material Level that's going to
Advance a person invited price life should not eat grains grown by The Killing Fields you should not you should also not eat greens that have grown without tilling of the field but are not fully ripe nor should have been processed grains cooked in fire indeed he should eat only fruit ripen by sunshine. Are you going to be a raw foodist ripen by okay so basically really simplifying your lifestyle big time to prepare cakes okay who just know he offered in Sacrifice from fruits
 and Grains grow naturally in the forest like make your own Larabars we obtain some new gray
you should give up his old stock of grains I thought I couldn't eat grains
 well I guess here is saying that you can mix them with a fruits
 Avana price should prepare a fatch cottage this is one of my goals of life that I want to make a fat cottage and live in a thatched cottage I lived in at that college for a month once where am I poor
 in a patch Cottage
 oh really okay yeah it's a special way to live yeah cow dung floor that's got it yeah I've stayed in them but I've never lived for a month and them prepare a thatched cottage shelter of a k I like to do that too in a mountain only to keep the sacred fire but he should personally practice in during snow fall when rain in The Shining of the sun is so so in other words you should have a little space
the shelter but that's only for performing your rituals otherwise you should be in during snow when Fire and Rain and the sun basically we should live a life Outdoors like everything else like everything everything everybody else threw the other end of the other animals out there we do we do things special but I'm grounded now taking off my shoes and socks and walk around Barefoot like every other beasts on this lion does you're not you're not some special guy everybody does this dog is you're doing this every day being very thoughtful 821 Nevada prop should wear matted locks of hair okay on his head and let his boss and let his body hair nails and mustache grow. Maybe I'm starting up about a price right now he's not cleanses body of dirt okay he should keep a water pot a deer skin and A-Rod
where the bark of tree has a covering I like I was thinking more of those really soft t-shirts now I'm talking dirty you know it kills me because it is it always this is always mentioned in so many different places where the bark of tree and in one at one point in my life I knew exactly what it was it's not it's not what we merely picture in her head is it some kind of soft fibrous kind of thing but I forget I forget would bamboo that someone may be worth it to me or something like that yeah I know what you mean it's not like I picture a big hunk chunky bar over it like people wear their sandwich signs to advertise your vacuum 30s that's what I'm picture is not like that it's a little bit more form-fitting
 I wonder if it means like it's actually like a textile or like a like a form of cloth made out of tree bark or something like
probably not I forget I just figured out yet
 big very thoughtful
 if I knew it was going to picture going to mind what these people look like heavy dreadlocks long mustache fingernails long fingernails are covered in dirt
 walking around in a deerskin meditation by art by our standards holding he finally cracked it lost it
 all right
 being very thoughtful be very thoughtfully Monoprice should remain in the force for 12 years 8 years 4 years two years or at least one year I can I take the one-year option I'll probably be up for one year see how it goes
second-year what it would like to join the Marines here see how it goes you should behave in such a way that he will not be disturbed or troubled by Chi much austerity you thought you had a party talking about
 when because of disease or old age one is unable to perform his prescribed duties for advancement and spiritual consciousness or study The Vedas you should practice fasting not taking any food here is going to shift here a little bit right now and again I think what we saw as we're hearing the you know the the earlier
 lifestyle recommend a toss to your lifestyle recommendations and then and then it has some verses that describe this is all there to develop this vision of seeing God everywhere what's going to be described now is like how that super austere life
tell that we just read about how it enables one to sit down
 and
 to this
 almost unimaginable kind of meditation there's as I read this recognize let's go back let's go back in the bag with time let's go back to the first Camp to okay and in the first cancer there was a chapter which described that after the battle of kurukshetra which is the you know the bug of agita precedes that and that whole battle is a day wore a to z j a t a r 18 day war is described their Mahabharata Baba Tom begins to pick up after that in the first Canto and you hear about how the Dora
 the welder is the King dhritarashtra right who he allowed his under Yona to to create that war with Arjuna
eponymous
 live the king dhritarashtra now his side lost
 really he could have been killed for all that he did I mean it are allowed to happen sure and some and he allowed so much Injustice 2 take place to can use during his family are doing as hell their brother now you just use the king
 he Bears no animosity towards to the rostra this is his uncle that really didn't care for him as he should have
 and you're the Russians living in that home
 really by the charity of you to steer the door comes back the doors the brother Judah roster but very wise he comes back from his pilgrimage and he speaks to his elder brother came to the garage and he convinces him you're wasting your time are you getting old you was living here in this pampered by the person that real that that
you treat mistreated so badly your teeth are getting loose your your your begin to the right whenever the whole favorite verses in your eyebrows at your Vineyard bad walking with a limp it was just it goes on and on your Hunchback him yeah your prostrated I met this is a time in life where you leave the luxuries of home you go out into the forest to practice meditation you prepare for death
 and and then we hear about how Geraci becomes is very Advanced to Stronger Yogi and it begins to separate all of the different elements from his body by sitting in one place in through some kind of yogic meditation he was able to separate all the elements of his body and ignited his whole body
being in in the fire that's within the body and in kind of like free himself now we here very similar description here but it sounds to me like if I understand this properly what's been described as this is being done more in the mind
 that in the Mind One releases all the different elements of their both through the tangible body and the subtle body
 and then they take some yachts in the next chapter in other words wants you come not it's like a mental exercise a meditation that one would do were they really deeply very
 when I say deeply I mean like like when you grind something finer and finer and finer and finer it is not just that you have to realize theoretically that you're not your body but internally you have to separate yourself from all the elements that make up your body so that you kind of stand alone
as sore as the spirit with a real sense of
 Detachment a real sense of separateness from your own body and mind you developed that experience through this type of meditation that's what you be described as do all that austerity was leading somewhere to the ability to that on this very deep level
 you realize your your your separateness from the body in the mind to begin to hear about that now
 x24 he should properly place the fire element in his own self and in this way give up bodily Affinity by which one thinks the body to be oneself or one's own that interesting concept this isn't even my boss I don't even own this body it's just it's a it's a combination of elements that have come together just for a moment
stuff we don't own our children we don't even own our face or a arms just let alone to us also like imagine that you went like on a vacation and someone loaned you the the what you stayed in the room that you're staying in a cottage or something and and then and then a whole list of people came forward and also let you know why you're staying here please use my pots and pans are going to leave them here for you while you're staying here you're not my surfboard is here and you can use it to go see you know I'm going to leave that here for you going to need a car while you're here please borrow mine while you're here and then after the the time comes for you to depart you would return all of those things to their rightful owners
 what we're going to hear about here in the next few verses is how all of these elements even the mind the entire
is the ego everything has been given to us by the Dave Us by the gods right or of the body that we move in as a temporary house that we're staying in it's got its got a number of facilities within it that are all provided by different personified elements of nature the Davis and so this is saying that the yogi is kind of not just waiting for the moment where the element of time or death separates him from from those things in a rough way but they're actually a very intentionally turning those things over at least
 in the mind and heart
 very consciously through a process of meditation property rights this in the in the comments or to this text 24
 he writes one shouldn't end in here he kind of this is why I think it is not exactly sure the roster who actually physically did this and let himself on fire in
all the elements were gone
 I think your property equating this kind of yogic dissolution
 and this kind of early and also the Guiana kaidee emerging into Bremen he's kind of equating them with having perfect knowledge with the perfect understanding that I am not this body that I am a woman that I am spirit so probably one should know perfectly well that the material body is nothing but a combination of the five elements earth water fire air ether this knowledge constitutes merging this knowledge just this knowledge just knowing this truly knowing it this knowledge constitutes
 merging of the material body and the five elements in other words if when you really know this it's like practically you've taken the elements of your body and you merge them back into nature you're no longer feeling a sense of identity with them you've given them all back merging into Brahman
 emperor
acknowledge generally when we hear about that we think of like after death one has merged into this spiritual energy property acquainted more with the perfect understanding he says merging into Brahmin imperfect knowledge means understanding perfectly that one is not the body but a spirit soul and that was practiced by the spawn a prostitute through this type of guided meditation
 sober self realize person who is who has full knowledge 24
 when I gradually merger of two year old body into the $5 you just start with 24 again he should properly place the fire element in his own self and in this way give up the bottle give up bodily Affinity by which one thinks the body to be oneself or one's own one should gradually merge the material body into the five elements earth water fire Erin
it's over self-realized person who has full knowledge should merge the various parts of the body in their original sources the holes in the body are caused by the sky the process of breathing is caused by the air the heat of the body is caused by fire
 In the Heat of the body is caused by fire and semen blood and mucus I'm sorry fire semen blood and it's like this mucus are caused by water that you got the hard substances like skin muscle and bone are caused by Earth and in this way all the constituents of the body are caused by various elements and they should be merged again into those elements okay very interesting at end and so text 24 and 25 dealt with the merging of
 what proper cause the gross body I think that we could call it like the tangible body
you're the body that you can touch right out of the earth the earth water fire are you sure they all make up these These are the elements that make up the body through meditation you merge all of those elements back into the original sources Now text 26 to 28 will have to do with the merging of the subtle body that mind the intelligence the ego the the subconscious mind merging them all back into nature and here is said by hand them over to the demigods that are the ones that gave them to you in the first place provided them for you in the first place text 26 to 28 through 28 there after the object of speech along with a sense of speech the tongue should be bestowed upon a bonfire craftsmanship and the two hands should be given to the demigod Indra but I think where it said fire pry the word ugly yeah you should have given you a hug me I could have been translated that way but yeah
the power of movement in the legs should be given to Lord Vishnu sensual pleasure along with a genital should be bestowed upon Joppa T the rectum with the power of evacuation should be bestowed in his proper place until you got a death god of death
 the oral instrument why is the rectum go to death I don't know where I didn't find anything and he's like oh yeah the oral instrument along with sound vibration should be given to the deities presiding over the directions the instrument of touch along with the sense of Jack's of touch should we give me to buy you make sunwind form the power of site should be bestowed upon the Sun the tongue along with the demigod varuna should be bestowed upon the water and the power
smell along along with the two are Speedy Kumar demigods should be bestowed upon the Earth First you living such an austere life and you custom to yourself to it that the distractions in your life or like incredibly minimized right at your at your at your living in a cave you got this patched hot your during the the elements and you're practicing this kind of guided meditation where you're sitting very still and everyday repeatedly you know day after day you're you're calling with in you're looking Within
 you're shutting yourself off to the externals it looking deep within and saying what I came in here it says you know my power of speech is not my power
 you know I offer that to ugly
the power my hands to do things is not my power has been lent to me
 I stand separate from that I grant that back to Indra you don't dump the sensual pleasure you do the sexual pleasure that's been granted to me bestowed by the the the Great Purge APA t.i. offer that back to you that is not mine you know I used it in the past and in the past you know to raise a family and in all that I have nothing to do with it though that was something given to me temporary I separate myself from it and you do that and you do that everyday and what should you know the mind can do incredible things are going to write like like the mind can have you feel things that aren't there like when people sometimes like they have an injury like they lose a leg or something
 yeah and the mind is Anthem the Phantom arm or the Phantom Fantasia yeah so there's you do or like that experiment that I spoke about that spoke about before where they took someone
and a yam
 they gave him glasses whereby when you look through them the world is upside down yeah and after wearing them for a few days the mine just shifted everything so that it's all them right side up through the glasses and and so here's a way where you're like very intentionally
 getting the mind to a place
 where it releases all of its attachment and identification with the body and it and so you call today to this understanding in such a deep way that you really is Hasley feel it and when you got that then you become the senior see then you just like wander and your your ability to to keep your mind focused on spirit and not become distracted by anything on the on the bodily level now is going really strong you know
 trying to figure out how this works practically
 like it may sound like
okay I'm going to retire to perform all these austerities and then I'm going to wander so I can look at my mom I'm thinking she can't wander will jelly the men would do it it's not like men have it develop superpowers in their old age in it it's like once you get to a certain age you wonder when you just look at even Indian people now they're like so many of them are so much tougher than we've lost all our wolfnest you know I mean my mom's pretty good she is 98 and she still got moves around by yourself but you do see these women in India that are like bent over like an upside-down L and walking with the stick and they're climbing up mountain climbing and climbing up that we've been sick.
 That being said you know our process is a little different our process is different in this but
Essence in it that's the same but they're probably has to be certain austerities we have to
 fully embrace
 it's certain ones like from the old traditions of I don't think like me and look at the message board with me Lord pack and Martine we don't have to move to a cave necessarily do it in in one sense you do write a lord hack Martini ready for going to a cave and the chief is the chef okay
 lonely
 go with a posse and tell you that you can move it to a kid with others
 Booker Elite your mother's friends l
 it's good it's good but I just like to eat like crap
super expensive building and it's terrible process food if you want Raisin Bran for breakfast cuz I didn't you guys Raisin Bran unbelievable and then there was another meal she's like yeah I meant at noon we have a little get-together and they let us pet dogs and things like that and and I was like what what do they serve bring me to get some snacks I go down there they're giving out super duper sweet lemonade I mean enough to put my body in shock you know and then or Shasta Cola Cola anymore but that was like they're giving this to the elderly what the hell is going on here do I have to like over see everything
 let me talk to the manager
these old people just sit there and ask them questions and one lady escaped Hungarian communism incredible Story another lady lived in Levittown Long Island what about Lolita
 alita's you know she decided she decided who's mixed with all these Western women it belongs to be just dropped off in you know Rajasthan in India and you're afraid to take her to the over to the bhakti center right now she could she who should be living in a cave right now you you could take her to the doctor said that's called stealing old people that their children are adults children who are like lawyers get involved I just think they do it where you take my mother do you know she's 90 years old yeah we took her to the temple oh I guess that's what we're supposed to be doing
