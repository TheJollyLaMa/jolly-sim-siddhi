yeah characters going to get tested or devotion is going to get tested so I can get tested you have been you know what I was thinking also that before we get into our morning announcements every culture goes to this is often times you see this picture of the Buddha getting tempted by the gods and you read this about this again and again or you hear the stories about as a deliberate it's all goes back to godhead he gets offered you know Heavenly Delights choose this planet you can live on this planet you know and in the in the pier to go to say nope nope nope nope and Jesus also was born brought to the top of the mountain with Satan and Satan said look at my look at my cities you can have any one of them have them all ass not today Satan not today Satan yeah very good

the Zoomers it's me it's me and the others coming together and hanging out most ideal setting in North Carolina flowers and cuts to his face and him returning those flowers in my face at the lovely flat flower festival in Mumbai
 directions
 here's are not going to last year the flower festival I went into thinking this like number 1213 I don't know how many times I've gone and I just think I don't know I'm just going to kind of go through at that right it's like I've been there done that now past year was the best I think I know I walked away
 that's accurate and lots of spiritual life does not get old spiritual bat flower battle
 kind of like what did I say that people do when they take those guns they shoot at each other the paint guns dual now
paint guns Tennessee
 it doesn't get old but it doesn't get a hold it should get all this it seems like there's something mystical about your tongue you know when we live in the temple we did the exact same songs everyday up until just a singer like there would be a little kirtan hog in the temple right and it just like you the same guy the same Melody every morning but never got out cuz we train ourselves to go deep and not go why there's even though your spouse in some Hindi Bhajan Sanskrit duties and stowed thrums Gujarati Bhajan Bengali Bhajan using the same every day the same same like 8 or 10 every day never get old always go deeper question for you rather squirrel
 Hindi bhajans by chance if you had to give up one and only have one which would you go with
Hindi Bhajan. You're trying you're trying to bait me and I'm not going to go for it as long as they're worshiping Lord Krishna the Lord of matura and I will sing No Songs how about that I'm not going to go there you too you just didn't answer the quiz just totally avoided that and I did think they're worshipping Lord Krishna that I will sing that song but if you could only sing either the Bengali This is not on that. That's like saying OK Google, li-ion I guess Greg the gates or Tim Riley which one's going to be how about that same thing just saying whatever songs glorify Krishna in any language
 all right so you would give up Bengali ones
but okay I guess you don't want people to join Zoom go to visitation or Mara here's our nothing for the day
 sometime this morning oh yeah he's great he's great cuz I like these Christians who goes so deep otherwise I tell you a hammock religions they just tend to be so I love them so much they tend to be so damn exclusive like you can't get in unless you follow our they let in our savior exclusively it's not like that they the teachings aren't like that we hear you're following Jesus or like all right follow Jesus you follow Jesus we love Jesus
 you know what I was listening to last night I'm going to scroll you this one after our sweet baby Krishna we just put on kirtan
YouTube and I tell you the model is rock band I got to interview these guys for the podcast cuz they are incredible has rock band they're incredible you just a lot of stuff but a true to go pee
 I'm glad you got to interview her for the podcast cuz
 talk about diversity and Equity everybody singing singing dancing losing their mind coming together in such Joy you could have diverse and smile
 how diverse was that at the tickets like $95 is there is there you know singing together jumping up and down actually bringing p
together you don't have to artificially Institute some way now we're going to make it equal it's a cold world are singing together best you dancing together that's what you'll see that are at the Archer come to the Rochester New York at the Archer New York County Down by Channing on Tuesday because you were chanting the Juggernaut Austin, New York
 I think she may come out very broad-minded you see that was sufis you see that with the Christian Mystics you see that with cabalist is that the word compile lists Kabbalah but anyway here's our Thomas Burton says people may spend their whole lives lives
 climbing the ladder of success
did he make this up
 I didn't know that I've been sick I've been quoting this for ever I think you did did Stephen Covey use this as well cover used it but I don't think you got it from town this morning it's definitely the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People a lot of my material comes from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People you're all your highly effective person and I could start a whole lives climbing the ladder of success only once they reach the top to realize that ladder is leaning against the wrong wall wow this is huge right we put in our time at an educational system and then we stay well now you want to really could become successful then you got to go to the university then you got to go to get your Master's and then he got a lot of times we are just like running down the track we don't even know where the
which line is
 so we think it's well maybe it's just some type of like position than some head hunter comes and grab his from college in which is his and his high-paying job high-paying seems pretty good that must be success and we never actually stop to analyze what is with what is a homerun look like for us and so there's a lot of hustle there's a lot of work there's a lot of resources right there's a lot of debt and then I'm like I don't even know if I want to hear I don't even know if I want to be at the top of this ladder I have all the accoutrements of success I got the latest I got the 2020 or 2025 you know Grand Cherokee or whatever or I got the latest iPhone and all the accoutrements of success but I feel
 empty I just wanted you to know and that's where we have to start to say now
 when it's maybe not doesn't appear to be the time it's baby
that's the most important now I should just look in my heart what do I want to do with the short life and if kids could do that before they get sent off to the workforce
 and it made me start asking this question what do I think a win would be in this world
 otherwise sometimes with bowel career path of her parents and to please our parents or two please sometimes we just feel like I've got to prove to my older brother or to my older sister or we just sort of like miss out on life but the interesting thing is supposed to be G
 I don't know my grandfather I never really met my grandparents I never barely met them on either side of my great-grandparents on both sides yeah my father died when he was five my grandmother I just knew her when she was old to speak a word of English
your father didn't die when he was fine father died when he was so I never met him the grandmother I knew as an old lady who didn't speak English my other my mother's grandparents they didn't speak English and basically I never really knew them what the speak of their parents my point is in only a generation from now or two generations
 our whole history is going to be pretty much forgotten if we live this very tiny in any Turtle time
 cuz I'm still going on even though their death even though they had a very real life time still marching on in this lifetime if we're not really following our hearts dreams
 and I met at the end and of course cuz it's this podcast following our internal hartner our spiritual Hearts dreams were missing out we're missing out on
perhaps this lifetime if we are getting pulled in directions that aren't going to even serve even what we want to be in this world so we always say we've got to figure out what are offering his in this world and then offer it back to God it's sometimes we are just already just out of the gates running and we don't even know where we're running to
 and life is short
 bastila I think we're all given gifts in this life you don't know it's gets may be relatively large or small ultimately they're all small. Even even the biggest people out there that you know relatively you know whether you're Taylor Swift or to some somebody that nobody knows their name practically just few people even know them sure you know gifts are relatively small
but the central question becomes where will they best be invested you know or conversely where will they be wasted you know you didn't and in all the energy that we put it in you kind of mentioned that you know we go out and we we go to school we get a University degree we got you know hours upon hours of training and developing different skills you know we become skilled
 and then there's just countless hours of work you know developing a whole Rolodex of contacts you know business contacts or something like that you know building using building up a business yeah yeah expanding Contracting expanding again meetings hours and hours and hours of meetings you know in tolerating you know the relationships involved in the competition that's involved in all that energy spent we're going to spend up we got his limit amount of energy and when you spend it you know there's a lot of emotional energy
being spent to in this life and that's going to happen we're going to spend either it's going to be well in all of that energy
 you know it's tolerable
 even the difficult parts of it are tolerable if it's being invested well sure and if it's not going to be invested well and we're going to lose you know who ever imagined you work for years and years and years and you put it all down you go to Vegas and put it on the table and and that you already invested in some stock and the next day you know it's it's all lost
 is it Christmas speaks of this in the bug of agita you don't know how to grow nachos deep whatever you wanted me to tell you know he easy says that you don't immaterial endeavor
 you invest so much in it the results of the world disappear
 but Krishna saying to Arjuna with spiritual Endeavors different in this type of endeavor the Endeavor where you give back
you give back without expecting anything in return you give you reconnect yourself to that root of all existence to God in that type of endeavor there's no loss there's no diminution and even the smallest amount of advancement on that path can protect you from all kinds of horrific down the road so that means offering a little flower like he came in this morning a little flower on the altar today that was a huge Endeavor in a spiritual life where I could be toiling for years and never lost the result is some some divorced from connection with source
 and it's just over divorced from connection with Source divorce from source source I don't want to be divorced from source
 I want to be spiritual of course
I want to be on a better course house that I do not like green eggs and ham all right so you know now provides going to speak to this he's saying you know your your is Lord Vishnu speaking to him David speaking to him and he's saying
 take anything you want all right I'm offering a he's testing in one sentence it's a genuine I want to please you right isn't it I love you I want to give you something just from the from the core of my heart but in another sense we're watching collage heart be tested what's in there what do you want he's been offered anything and everything you want he said I'm not interested in taking things from you
 I want to stay connected with you I've watched my father who is like this you know super a level top top notch materialist
I seen how a level material I'm a black belt in materialism degree and any saw how he he he climbed that ladder it was an intense ladder to climb for his father right he perform severe yoga ghosts are these for like
 incalculable amount of time you know he climbed the ladder to look workout him it was at the wrong wall so now we get to hear him kind of give his Exposition on on on on life here you know what it's like what what is it all about he wants to find love he said that's the wall I wanted to be up against right I want to climb the ladder that leads me to place where my heart is entirely pure
 where where it'll be pure enough it's soft enough to experience the esoteric and bhakti the the true love that we're all searching for in this world and never quite exactly
mining dude or a reducer
 prelati clean it out
 I wonder if Mara was tested Miller ensuring a Dave what would you like me or I'll give you anything you like anyting the pure love of God are you home and see electric car you have to take birth again for one of the plants Mara when you're driving around in the car what kind of testing right now. Know we're going to find a victim to that's my issue she's going to fall victim to someone saying hey you want to okay I'll take a maybe.
 And then you see someone driving by
the latest model fancy electric car or something in you is there a little bit let her answer the question and I want an honest answer she wants what she wants I'll tell you her material desires and more plants electric stove for propane one but for your fancy driving around ego and what about that is that they're like we should hate this black and she's like whatever
my materialistic mind goes to
 matte black black rims tinted windows so I can nuts you got those fancy hubcaps for the good of a baby baby moon hubcaps for the Airstream anything Casteel by, I would like you to chanto the opening my trust that smile
 can I see the horns growing out of your head right now I can talk to you either way we never know where I'm at your desires are at until we get offered the world yeah it's happening
 we just talked about that last night
this is common and different kind of spiritual literature I'd like you were talking about in the Bible Jesus gets
 who got tested like that yeah there's all these famous paintings of the boot and all these I think it's gods or demons tempting him he's sitting there in peace and of course we talked about it all the time then for the Geva goes back to the spiritual world all the gods become envious of him of the temp temp him
 stop off on my planet
 I think kasuba we're going to have to get all these tests before we go back to Krishna and right now I said maybe we don't even have the karma to even get for not being tested yet that's why I think these people are very very high-level successful high-level beautiful high-level intellect
 but they say you know what the
nothing
 all I want is Christian the letters P the right wall Paschal I had a interesting conversation with Naranja Nisswa me back when I was in my poor
 it's deep person I respect him enough so now I see about the yogi and many many many decades serving selflessly
 deeply contemplatively and I said to him and I said Mirage I read these books
 by the time she's going to try to read the back of a Time rated different post sometimes it seems like the message it sometimes you feel the message
 I was so close
 you know so close to the recovering our own spiritual nature so close to you know Krishna Prema it's were so close to it you know
 and then sometimes I'm reading
exact same books
 and it seems like a tell me another message we got such a long hard path to walk and if we're going to be tested again and again and again
 and I said I said what you make of Margie says and he said I I wish I could remember exactly how I phrased it but he said I've learned to accept books
 now that accept both it's interesting right kind of gets it gets very grave when you start to think about here you know after years since I'm Decades of practicing bhakti
 and then you have your Quiet Moments alone with God in your heart
 and you begin to say it is kind of gray if you know so I can have my clothes to on my far from you have a good to be tested so much more before you allow me in. I want what am I holding onto why am I so
how can I be so clueless and I'm holding on to things that prevent me from from this helped me.you know what do I have to do what I have to do and we don't always want to do it we with this weakness of heart got to get stronger got to get more convinced got to
 I'm going to be more like a lot of serious Sarah
 okay right in the musketeer that I'm driving around him and give him some smoke before I started she might become witches are very means of Conquest when should I expect the base to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan read you the Super Bowl she would be until it starts watching the goddess of learning and then she'll be off today the author not stopped right in back of a Save-A-Lot by give it to you tomorrow okay talk to you about the teenage the key but regular tennis and classes in the Bog of Tom and by rendering Services a devotee all that is troublesome the Harlequin eradicated loving sister
the Supreme Lord who has praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact Nina tells me she going to be in my heart I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers open my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer My Bae since he's out there Lotus feet reading for the shoe mud bog Tom Canto 7 chapter 10 text eat
 text 80 my Lord this is prologue speaking oh my Lord because of Lusty desires from the very beginning of one's birth where's that means just desires to get you know I looked up the word Lusty actually what did you I did and it's not even like the archaic kind of translation but even like the modern translation of Lusty
 it means
 typing in here
nasty nasty memes healthy and strong full of vigor that's how he's healthy and strong full of bigger and heavier she's ready. Today is a pejorative all these years I don't know if will he say unless he desires and it you got the strong desires I know and it's it's interesting in materialistic side that sounds great I got a strong desire for you strong young Lusty young man that's a good thing because of Lusty desires from the very beginning of one's birth the functions of one's senses mind life body religion patients intelligence shyness opulence strength memory and truthfulness
 vanquished
it's me first when when I'm less T it's me first
 yeah and oh my Lord when I see Toby is I don't know how can I say that in a non condescending way right now you can't
 okay. Don't get upset have a nice slow down
 but stuff in India
 in the concert first he speaks to this initial complication this is profound stuff ready it's a life-changing I want everyone attentive attentive over there
 his preference as soon as one has material desires not desire to write as soon as well as material is our desires to wander this world independently of any kind of God or Source or anything. Nobody's got any rules to impose upon me
as soon as as soon as one has material desires one loses their spiritual identity
 are the whole whole lot right in that one right there I want you to lose your identity so are we have an identity that spiritual spiritual identity means Eternal identity right like that that's what we always are we may be out of touch with it I'm standing in front of a beautiful woman let's say Mara don't know you just sorry but because you see something beautiful think oh how gorgeous I like to enjoy that then that forget your
man you see them as a woman my pleasure they longer they lose their spiritual identity and I forget my spiritual identity right that is great evil and God says fun it's because it's sheets you add your real identity that's not trying to like John God's not trying to rain on your party is trying to give you intelligence sleep how to enjoy the world returning to the big party
 what is that said that you can return to the real party there's a real party the sankertown party okay so this is what it once you have material desire you lose your spiritual identity and other words now you identify
the body with the gender with a nationality with a circumstance all of that you lose your spiritual identity your terminal identity okay that's the initial complication in one sentence as soon as one has material desires one loses their spiritual identity now come all the consequential issues
 then all the paraphernalia of one's life everything that you've built up right everything you've acquired everything you've developed then all the paraphernalia of one's life including one senses
 once body
 their religion right all it's like normal right but all of my practice is all the time all the Hail Marys that I can't hit her I had all of the times I've gone to church are all the different rituals I've done all of that once patients all that have tolerated patiently one's intelligence you know one's ability to reason they're all deviated from Once original Krishna consciousness
 as soon as
material desires one cannot properly use their senses their intelligence the mind and so on it's a ladder
 that's been taking a long time to acquire and then you put up against the wrong wall and it all. It's just all burns out and it's got a climb to the top of it
 and what you what you were thinking you were going to get when you got up there
 if not then text 9 my Lord
 so then so you know then the question over here probably sitting there you know there's a fundamental question how did I lose my spiritual identity property just told us how to do it we've cultivated these material desires and we're talking yesterday about it right by contemplating the object of the senses you get past 12 volts attachment from Attack of lost from laugh at your lunch with Phil Anger from Hangar you get angry you lose your intelligence
lost all down back into the material pull your spiritual beautiful spiritual identity such it on Monday right that Eternal knowledge and Bliss that natural state that they were craving for that were searching for through materialism it's gone how do we get it back we got to get control of these desires the how did this is where the practice about to Yoga Works right it's like it's not enough amount
 I think at the extinguisher desire for the same learn how to redirect that or directed back to Spirit right
 and you got something going on room
 already
 by the way you know Corona did she opened up on the chat board little Corona 10 year old material desires with us she wants a super fast car and she does but of course not a Formula One those she's not interested in okay she wants ice cream
Harley not just like on occasion will then she also wants to go to Disneyland or not going to like it you'll climb that wall Corona why did I spend all this money she doesn't have waiting in lines eating junk food you're not going to like it I'm going to help you puncture that romantic bubble right now
 okay let's go on just when we thought she was a devotee that ten-year-old she got something deep down there it's not that bad evil thoughts young Corona listen all my Lord when a human being is able to give up all material desires Koruna in her mind she becomes eligible to possess wealth and opulence like yours when you sound like kind of thing what you let go you get everything you got everything
it's really true isn't it it's really true
 people are working hard to get everything and when they let go first of all they realized I don't need anything then if you get and you you don't care but you can have it all
 but they don't desire it so they're just happy with whatever they got is sometimes they get so much and they're just still detached
 cuz I spaced it if you get it but you're attached to it you'd suffered tremendously cuz there's always fear of losing it cuz that's how the material work always stuff works more stuff for anxiety more problems
 The Scream
 oh my Lord text him oh my Lord. Six opulence has
 oh Supreme person oh Supreme Soul killer of all the miseries oh Supreme
10 in the form of a wonderful lion and man let me offer my Spector bass in season 2 you
 interesting personality of God had said I was going to say interesting that he referred to his killer of all the miseries because you just song kill it was miserable but even he killed his miseries.
 I mean it was a miserable life is already cuz you feel ya what space could if it's all about me
 people are sad
 miserable okay it's okay ruinous got more material desires coming out on the message board another facet of his formula one
 and love it but I just don't want to go and what does she like to watch them okay all right we'll take you there
 the spring person I've got it said my dear prologue
devotee like you never desires any kind of material opulence is either in this life or the next
 none the less I order you to enjoy the opulence has enjoy the opulence has of the demons in this material world acting as their King until the end of the duration of time occupied by Manu he's got to act in this world like a king live like a king which means you're going to get surrounded by all to opulence is but there's a difference when a spiritualist takes on a position of authority of power of well if they realize I'm just doing this for Krishna once you get attached to it could become envious of those people to do their spiritual they got all this stuff it's very easy to get envious of that
 the interesting thing is if the person is
really insincere
 you don't have that curse them or hate them they're going to feel the pain of it once your task to opulence you will feel pain inside rest rest rest of these that they're going to suffer and you'll be able to enjoy their self yeah yeah it's so interesting how Envy works like that if a person is really insincere and you like are they they think they're so spiritual but they're trying to opulence they're such Baker's hey get it they're going to suffer
 so let the world do its let the universe
 for Revenge at be the cheerleader for people's misery it's going to come it just makes you miserable wanting people to be miserable so I hope they get their karma
 call work it out the material world will work it out grind it all out what do they say about the justice system
it says a grind slowly but very finely or something like that right isn't it the way it was before the wheels of Justice grind slowly but very finely I think that's what it is to the wheels of Japan from there, so we can just let it go they have to deal with that, it's going to come and if you're going through some, right now we just accept that's what we got now what it how can I move forward just getting some, now just burning through some, but the devotees sees it differently than the body sees this, right now is going to bring me to a higher place it's going to Humble me God favors the humble
 and it's humbling me I was so proud of everything I had no I lost the stuff I thought this stuff was me an extension of me it's not me I can't own it I can't possess it just look at me here I'm trying to grow my hair out long it's not growing as a girl
funny look at my hair I calmed it today and I find Beard brush and comb my hair over and nothing's growing I think it's time for you to start to get hair products
 Chelsea got there yet to use any beard products Willmar about me some beer glass Christmas it's all it's all a scam achuta on the chap what he asked cuz it right in that verse for a little St n leaper lad was just ordered to enjoy the opulence has of the Demons I think he was just a dynasty right and you say and that dynasty is a acquired you know it needs a leader
 and it's in a comes and being a leader that comes with all the opulence is of leadership
play saying you take that role now you become the leader of the Demons you know not that you become demonic yourself
 but that you take over the role as the head of the Dynasty live in the palace sit on the throne
 you know you know take on the fame
 excetera excetera
 Meghan McCain
 I didn't ask for it
 but you got it
 Exit 11
 ice cream personality. It said my dear / La devotee light at Detroit history
 it does not matter that you were in this material world that you should always continuously hear the instructions and message is given by me and always be absorbed in thought of me for prime the super-soul existing in the core of everyone's heart therefore give up fruit of activities and worship me this is amazing you could be stormy in the material world but 100%
not of the material world if you just follow the simple process it was a key issue he saying I want you to take on leadership of a demoniac lineage and live like a king
 but you can do it in such a way where you never lose touch with your spiritual identity and was the first thing that he said you know what to do to do that rub
 you live in this world and it's right there tends to continuously hear the instructions and message is given by me
 continuous it doesn't mean every now and then continuously nityam bhagwat to save you what we're doing right now right get together read Bob with time together read Bhagavad Gita together gets Kevin even have a little sweet baby Krishna here is the deal people if you don't like temples if you don't like institutions if you don't like churches make your own house
make your house a whole message invite people I get it so feel right you know I'm not really into temples and monasteries and things like that I'm scared of organized religion great organize your household and invite some friends over say hey let's have spiritual night and read to them you don't have to be part of some big church or institution we're not getting kickbacks from it religious Institution for saying the stuff we're not on payroll
 invite able to your hat we want people to put more spirit in their life
 thank you brother that's great advice for me not to become a spiritual person oh well you know I'm not into organized religion do something yourself just do it yourself well I don't like you know is this other Institution
do it your own way just do it just do it and stop complaining how other people do it says that you're complaining
 am I said that if you're hearing about me regularly continuously you'll never you'll always be absorbing thought of me and then he gives the reason why I for I am the super-soul existing in the core of everyone's heart and other words if I'm understanding this correctly saying that when we if you and I have you broken off and I are sitting around we say hey rather than wasting time at putting our ladder up and climbing a wrong with why don't we take out the truth about what I read it together and discuss once we start doing that Christmas in my heart and he's in your heart is a conscious being in both of our hearts and he internally respond to that message in some way that something he awakens
can you cuz he's in your hearts right once you go there once it's cuz it's also true that by reading the bog what time your heart is becoming clean and then you're going to start to re-examine your ladder immediately that's there to be coming clean and I'm like why am I a lion down this path a 120 mph I might have missed the exit man I might I should have got up right why am I working so we get this all the time I like I don't know why I'm doing what I feel like seeing things more clearly now you know times. Krishna poonia shoving a tune up the Christian is the part of Miami situation everyone's heart
 and the benefactor of the truthful devotee and it cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart to the devotee who has developed the urge to hear his messages that's
in themselves virtuous when probably heard Enchanted say that again
 this is why we time powerful bug is a from the first cantos second chapter text 17 Shri Krishna of the personality of God who is the part of mom on Super Soul and everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear his messages which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard Enchanted lenses the desire for material enjoyment that almost sounds like a Bad Thing from the disaster material enjoyment that's when you actually become happy in the healthy lesser a nurse spiritual desires manifest will you know I got this great message on the gram from Timothy Tucker is one of our regulars rumors
it was like the day before the retreat and he's like it was such a heartfelt message was like oh man all I can do is think I should just read it to you right now but it was something like all I can do is think about how I can have more in my life. All I can think about is like how can I think of Krishna be around devotees war chant Christians to do at home right now get over to this wisdom of the sages Retreat right now is like you know he just like his desire brought him closer and closer and closer so what are we Desiring
 whatever you desire that's what you're going to get be careful what desires are trying to cultivate and try to see where this is going where is the end of this path going you want material success with the goal of that is that ends up
don't you think Krishna has a much better agenda than your agenda when I checked why not make this your focus Krishna what do you want for me Cristiano what would you like me to do with this short life nicer if she has any takeaways for today I'm going to need some stuff today for me yes you said you were going to need some today because we're hearing all about it she's really fast cars today
 sometimes our biggest challenge is how we react
 yeah okay sometimes our biggest okay
 yes okay
 analyze what your win is before you start the hustle okay Do the Hustle
in material Endeavor all your Investments disappear car Mama instructs people in the heart
 okay
 it's immaterial and ever and ever all your Investments disappear in spiritual Endeavor there's no loss climb the ladder to a soft heart climb the ladder to a pure soft heart heart okay
 lost cheats you out of your real identity
Ducks more stuff means more anxiety as soon as one has material is their spiritual identity for you to re-examine your ladder be careful what desires you cultivate plant in the garden The Garden of Your Heart Krishna has a better agenda than yours I don't want to be divorced of source I want to be on a better course of course
