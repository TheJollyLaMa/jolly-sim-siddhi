 hello. Hello.
today by
 why from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your host and co-host in senior educator at the Barclays Center in New York a stupid ass walk in the show everybody Welcome to
 Wednesdays Thursdays Thursday study to Shew my bag with time we are alive a Super Soul farm with Linda Linda Linda and Maya and a bunch of people starting to trickle in and including the stupid ass will be here today for our wisdom of the sages Retreat starting off tomorrow looking forward to that and creative celebration of the appearance of Lord is showing at abs
and yesterday we did a sweep baby Christian in the shrink a Dave
 addition costume it was really nice we read about the appearance of the deity of the string of David Maya pour which the worship initiative in my poor came because the devotees were attacked
 it was quite shocking when I re-read the story I must have read it years ago but it wasn't just like imagine getting attacked by that one guy not to force my two guys coming with weapons midnight in the middle of the night and machetes yeah but they're bombs and guns 35 deck boards came and attacked the temple because you know why the dacoits went to an astrologer and the astrologer said that their Radha Rani Didi was made of solid gold
 it's so the welder had it wrong but she's holding complexion
I see how to write she actually is it was it was meaning it was worth more than gold because it's true much around here the DD of the divine feminine so they want to steal the DVD of Radha Rani and in so doing you know this this this person is a guru in our moving very nice to Billy about the rock of a Swami they threw a bomb at him and blew his leg off course
 anyway so anyway from there on they decided you know what we needed and string to Dave deity to protect this Temple and it was a whole incredible drama we read the whole story about how they got this deity and no they went to South India to these deity Carver's to carve them and no one would carve the deity of okra and a string of the Ferocious manifestation of Miss ringa they were too scared to do it take a seriously very seriously and he said all I can make some money I'll carve you a DD
finally after one guy after the bed Tim and the guy had to get his gurus blessings to do it and even though it was like are you sure they want to do this it's a very very high standard to worship this deity why would they want to bring such chaos we've been reading about how all the de Vis tried to approach the string Dave in this mood and they're just like we can't speak only prolonged can kind of speak to him so you want to worship that the most ferocious shringa and pleading with the the shopping teeth at the Carver they come from families of Carver's you said okay I will complete it in six months for the devotees like when you miss the point I think that when they told him that the deal would be worshipped in my poor and I would we then this iroko they are you going to worship in there that's understanding the special nature of that place
Myrtle naked living at all okay then we'll carve the DD I didn't get them here that part that's why they agreed when they heard that
 then I said oh okay then we'll carve this to you. Patty the Carver also had a dream that his Guru came to and says yes you can carve one for these iskcon devotees and then he went and he went to his Guru in his Guru left him this message when he woke up that said that as well anyway he said to the American the devotees who are on you know American time like how long is going to take we need is Didi by this time he said I will get it to you for in six months comes back like 5 months later with I purchased all the paraphernalia for the worship says okay where's the D
 I haven't even found the stone yet and the Diwali was like what you mean you haven't found this until there's there's Granite all over this place just get a chunk of granite and Carver Diddy
you know and they thought he was just on you know being lazy or lethargic and he said I am not carving a grinding mortar to grind spices this is a deity the stone must be alive and there's ways to test of a Stones alive and it it in seven places and it's got to make a sound and then the second step is there's a little bug that drills through the granite that's the second way you can tell it's a living piece of granite and so they waited they found it and then it took six months from that date date to carve many many stories but we had a great one if you want to listen to that and go back and listen to it on her patreon account
 good morning
 good morning brother looking forward to seeing you today I'm coming
 all right it's right very very beautiful up here right now it's quite breath
I want to take you swimming I know you like to swim
 Tamara G Mara Tamara Stern to talk we have some announcements for today back to your cover you beating are at noon and 1:30 eastern time and tomorrow for Patriot members Cult of Cain Austin to class at 10:30 a.m.
 Loretta
 got Nuggets in a regular tell me tell me about the Nugget I want you to read them know that to me I did a lot of talking already do you want me to read them know that I want you to read it you know a couple weeks ago we had a nugget from Miles Davis remember that
 what's the difference between John Coltrane and Alice Coltrane his daughter
 if you're playing with my flow here are though is there anywhere yet today you may have guessed by now that we're
you know something from John Coltrane
 Jungkook yet his you know John Coltrane he was a person that was deeply exploring spirituality
 and his Masterpiece was a record called a love Supreme by so many musicians were inspired by that and so many you know people looking at the spirituality were inspired by that his daughter his daughter was not only Spirit she was like a devotee she's like a Hari Krishna maha-mantra and and all that and maha-mantra and I believe she was a devoted Christian and Alice is married to John Coltrane I thought Alice was his daughter Mary could you clear that up I got more better find out if she was a devotee I think she hasn't initiated name I'm not sure from where it what that is Isabella June medium salsa
wife a wife okay so I was coaching with the wife I thought you were the gold standard of knowledge about rock and roll here the students is in rock and roll yes there is
 everybody knows that Urban waste okay so this is from you know he made this record that inspired so many people and I was reading up on it a little bit he also wrote a poem that like accompany the record and the Nuggets today comes from that pump
 okay great okay there it is from John Coltrane says God breathes through US interesting that a saxophonist would use that you know kind of yeah
yeah
 God breathes through us so completely
 so gently
 we hardly feel it yet
 it is our everything
 I think about this I'll read it again God Breeze through US think of ourselves as a saxophone or think of the universe is a saxophone
 God breathes through us so completely so gently
 we hardly feel it yet
 it is our everything and I think this speaks to
 you know if if we got an empiricist skeptic
 and we put him next to a spiritualist
 let's say they were both
 experienced in their field
yeah they're going to let that do look very likely going to come to this fundamental disagreement that one is going to see the universe as a random
 interaction of material elements and the other is going to see that no no there's nothing random here this is all very intentional it's all very purposeful there's much more to it than you can see with your eyes
 and
 when you start to approach spirituality you know it may start as kind of like a vague intuition you know that there's more to life than just the physical you might not be able to prove it as a matter of fact this did the experience spirituals may not be able to prove to the empiricist that there's something more right it's it's kind of like that a two says there's no evidence
 and the spiritual says the Everest is every
come on this is like you just not in the evidence you just passing it yeah but it's everywhere but in one sense it so gentle
 that we miss it although it's our everything and so in the beginning that spiritual it's an incident tuition it's a vague intuition that there's more
 and as one goes deeper into it you know it it can progress to like a its feelings right I feel a vague intuition just got to be something more to this has got to be a meaning to this this got to be something Beyond this
 and then there's a feeling of like satisfaction as one goes deeper into spirituality you know like sethra virtue
 at the you know I feel satisfaction rather than satisfaction through sense gratification right through through Detachment I feel satisfaction rather than through sense gratification and where you going deeper and then you do that a conviction kind of grows
 that's
 you know
I'm beyond these temporary identity zombie on this body
 that there's got to be some kind of there's a fee again the situation is growing is getting deeper is developing the I am this Consciousness that's beyond this and that it's connected to the broader Consciousness that there's a kind of Oneness
 and then you can go still deeper and I think that what John Coltrane was speaking about yours is this this growing feeling with his growing conviction that there is a supreme Consciousness right that there's a supreme Consciousness that exists inside and outside of everything
 and it's overseeing everything in his controlling everything and and but that we have a connection a personal connection or loving connection to that Supreme Consciousness that's working through us at every moment that's in our heart that's within us that you just as we're saying yes it write it in the person
within me without me everywhere penetrating all the different layers of existence this constant loving Divine Consciousness is present and I'm beginning to feel that I can feel that intuition that the conviction is growing that did this this all is happening for a purpose and it's all about discovering that love going deeper and deeper into that left so he was expressing that through his music you know he was he was playing his horn and thinking like this
 and I wanted to read you something right now I got a little something here from this was from an NPR All Things Considered
 addition when you have a sewed
 Annie taking a few chunks out of it since John Coltrane recorded a Love Supreme in December 1960
born released at the following year he presented it as a spiritual declaration that his music that has musical devotion was now intertwined with his faith in God
 in many ways the album mirrors coltrane's spiritual Quest that grew out of his personal troubles including a long struggle with drug and alcohol addiction
 now then they quote this job
 this Professor Luis Porter heads the master's program in jazz history and research at Rutgers University in Newark New Jersey
 he is the author of John Coltrane his life and music so this is what Luis Porter says he says coltrane's more or less finished coltrane's more less finished his improvisation
 that seems to be a typo there Coltrane more or less finishes improvisation he's talking about the composition itself that you know
timor-leste finished his improvisation and he just starts playing The Love Supreme Motif right the way that the record starts is the bass player
 lays down to the Steam for no team
 and then John Coltrane improv you know improvises on top of that for some time and then he doesn't seem so he starts playing he finishes his improvisation and then he starts playing that multi that the baseball hats begun with
 he says this is something very unusual it's not the way he usually improvised it's it's not really improvised it's something that he's doing and if you actually follow it through he ends up playing this little loves to Scream theme
 in all 12 possible keys
 to me he's giving you a message here first of all he's introduced the idea he's experimented with it he's improvised with
with great intensity now he's saying it's everywhere it's in all 12 keys anywhere you look you're going to find This Love Supreme he's showing you this in a very conscious way down a saxophone
 interesting huh I like d r i a lot of things to say okay well that's good let's continue with this right now that's not scroll off let's try to try to stay with me you're okay okay just as if there's sommat like you know you read a book
 A Book Like A fascinating book like the Brehob bhagawat I'm ready to write Sonata goswami where he's he's writing about layers Universal
right layers in the planetary system within one Universe layers of beyond the universe into the spiritual realm you know layers all the way up to the glow covering.
 You know we can understand layers of Consciousness from Bremen to part of Mama 22 pahlavan you know that's that's a progression of divine love
 there's there's layers of of of you know there's that there's a different layers of the coverings that cover us you know that the other coaches that can be penetrated so he's trying to say on average is he's playing this this theme
 and he's telling us that this love that one did that there's a loving to my conscience on every layer and he does that musically to playing it through all the 12 keys and it's it has in my mind you know he's on to something you know like he's he's he's expressing something that's like princess Express in the bug of agita
I got to go to the 15 chapter the bug of agita
 and Krishna let me read something for that chapter for you okay
 he sang This Is Christmas peak in 15 chapter
 he says he's talking about seeing Beyond
 just the empiric external what can we proceed with the eyes
 and Christian says the endeavoring transcendentalist who are situated self-realization they can see all this clearly but those whose minds are not developed and are not situated self-realization cannot see what is taking place though they may try
 and then he begins to talk about how he and end at the end of the chapter Christians going to say this is the most he says this is guyoung to Mom Sean this is the greatest secret and all the description and all the babies
 that there's this person there's this Consciousness personal Consciousness that's penetrating all love
existence so Christian said I'm the Splendor of the sun which dissipates the darkness of the whole world it all comes from me I'm the Splendor of the moon in the Splendor of fire are also from me right all light is coming from him a warm is coming from him I enter into each planet and buy my energy they stay in orbit I become the moon and thereby Supply the juice of life to all vegetables need the nourishment that you get in your body I'm on that layer as well right on penetrating it I'm permeating it on the fire digestion Next Level. Only that you do have the food but you need to digest the food I'm there as well right and I join with the air of Life outgoing and incoming to digest the four kinds of food stuff and I'm The Prana that's moving your body and operating your body I'm seated in everyone's heart
 and so not just sitting and now he's been saying not just not just
we maintain you but even your cognitive ability I'm supplying that says I'm seated everyone's hard and from me, remember it's now is your forgetfulness by All The Vedas I am to be known to The Vedas you learn how I penetrate all these different levels they're so like this he's he goes on and on since you know with this I do that
 I'm penetrating everything your your ability to to think your ability to digest your ability to move your the world ended that you're moving through
 on every level on there on every level I'm on permeating it and to know that the end and then Kristen says towards the end of the chapter says whoever knows me as the Supreme
 without doubting
 is it nor everything
 and they therefore engage themselves in full devotional service to me oh son of bar to this is the most confident part of all the Vedic scriptures and it is now.
closed
 buy me to you whoever understands this will become wise and their Endeavors will know Perfection so that you know this is fundamental you know we can talk about spirituality and very vague term
 but here the bhagavad-gita is getting very specific you know saying that that everything that you see and do try to receive it more deeply try to understand and feel what's beyond it
 what's maintaining it and when you feel it you'll love it and you'll feel it's love the Love Supreme and you feel that that love Supreme is permeating all different all the different layers of existence and he was feeling that somehow in expressing it through his music
 John Coltrane
 alright let's Dive In
 the right of the Mesquite Diner Rancho Cucamonga Saraswati before deciding to shoot my bag of how much the very means of Conquest when should have respected obeisance
the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan reach you this ship unless you and being a bunch of other stars spotty the goddess of learning and she'll be asked today if the author not stop are used to bother you so you need some backup at Save-A-Lot bag of Taki and classes in the baggage, and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome bahara become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with Transit Dental songs will be established as in a revocable fact check Chuck Schumer has my history I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are open my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet really finish my bug times can 27 chapter 9 * 32
 so we have provide young provide continuing on with his prayers to
at Lourdes Ringgit Dave this is right after Lord of string a Dave did his did his job of killing the great Demon King around me cuz she poo
 oh my Lord of supreme personality of God had after the annihilation the Creative Energy is kept in you
 because after the annihilation Tire Universe the Creative Energy is kept within you so this is like the seed warm in the same way you get a giant European weeping elm tree at a little seed that we spoke about this seed seed pods There's an actual Tree in there the ability to grow a tree is in that tiny pod so when the universe ends is wrapped up in seed form actually how are the creative energies Captain you will appear to sleep with half-closed eyes actually however you do not sleep like an ordinary human being for you are always in a transcendental stage beyond the creation of them
real world and you always feel Transit Dental Bliss as car in a duck side dish knew you'd us remain in your Transit Dental status not touching material objects I'll let you appear to sleep this sleeping is distinct from sleeping and ignorance and I love how the fact that you know if you just observe nature me and Mary were jumping in the pond yesterday so you have a little was it called the tadpole tadpole has his whole life span where changes his body within a year or less the whole thing's going through this life cycle to full life cycle but it's tiny and then you see something like a human the course or a tree which even lives longer than the human I'll have these life cycles is beginning middle old age you know when the tree is in its old age
 then you see some other in a plants like you know Century plan like a type of agave that live a hundred years before they
their stock up in the sky everything's got to be a sort of life cycle sometimes life cycles are on a day like certain flies live add a certain animals live in a 6-month certain animals live whatever year why not why not the universe also is part of this life cycle as well it's actually a very
 realistic understanding of intuitive creation Theory why not in the plan in the higher beings and yeah they have their life cycles, himself has a life cycle and that's even tiny compared to Vishnu Brahma has a bicycle and he doesn't leave his either because he can see behind him
 has a light Brahma can I change lanes okay
oh my Lord oh Supreme personality of godhead after the annihilation the Creative Energy is kept in you will appear to have a station in the material world is also your body this total lump of matter is agitated by your potent energy known as Kawasaki and the three modes of material nature and manifested you awaken from the bed of Shay Shay Warren unto others The Serpent and from your navel a small transcendental see is generated
 it is from this seed that the lotus flower of the gigantic universe is manifested exactly as a banyan tree grows from a small seed so if you know about Banyan trees are these massive fig trees that can grow up to there's one in Calcutta the size of a city block it just keeps expanding as much bigger actually I think it sounds like a square mile
have scored some Big Lots Big Block big buck you know here he saying everything here is so profound now and everything that he's saying is to help us develop that Vision right to see more than everybody else he's kolaches it right the cosmic manifestation this the material world is also your body that's try to understand how God is everywhere that way right like just like our Consciousness is everywhere in our body cuz we're the soul within the body
 he saying your form is Vishnu is the soul of the universe and it spreads its awareness throughout the entire universe the same way that our awareness is spread out there are Tire body and then you have this Shakti energy of yours called time which makes the whole universe move okay
 if the commentary to the Shriner
 the three different forms of Maha Vishnu namely are in a duck say Vishnu Garbo.
and she reduction additional who are the origin of creation and maintenance are gradually being described for mahavishnu garbage out ship Ramada bishnu garbage Akshay Vishnu is generated in from garbage Akshay Vishnu Vishnu gradually expand so how is garbage extra Vishnu generated from mahavishnu who first one whose mom is Maha Vishnu is
 the Vishnu of all the universes combined sound like the whole material realm and then he how does he generate garbage out
 he generates he generates it by
 by sleeping on the
 the water milk milk a tear duct tape in the cosmic water
 just explain it
cuz I think I got it wrong no no did that. Just the milk was the only thing that that was going to cause all in the causal ocean yeah
 it's a front wedding he's starting to sweat
 and that crazy option
 and then from divorce is coming from his house and then and then you lying in that Waters from through his breathing out of the pores of his body, unlimited universe is so he doesn't generate is one garbage duck show me generate unlimited carbon dioxide emissions
 and then that carbon dioxide Vishnu generates unlimited more cured Akshay vision is he said that that's got in the heart which we normally use the term parmatma 40K
 that's the original cause of everything is Vishnu and consequently the cosmic manifestation is not different from Vishnu this is confirmed in the back of the unit n8108 where Krishna says
cost of a bar to take the source of all spiritual and material world everything emanates for me garbage jiu Vishnu is an expansion of car and a side dish new who is an expansion of Chunk are shown in this way Krishna is ultimately the cause of all causes the conclusion is that both the material world and Krishna is ultimately the cars in this way the spiritual worlds are considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord we could understand that the material body is caused by the spiritual body and therefore an expansion of the spiritual body that's when one takes up to her about timoti's one's entire material body spiritualized simile similarly in this material world when Krishna conscious just moving expands the entire Material World becomes spiritualized
 wow is what it yeah as long as we do not realize this we live in the material world when we are fully Christian
we live in the material world we live not in the material world but in the spiritual world is very very interesting write this stuff is very profound but it's not profound like a diesel day that we can make sense of it it's like it's deeply profound but it just there's a logic to it you know that normally you know that again if you go back to the Pierre sister and the spiritualist a sis is going to say that Consciousness arises out of matter
 and the spiritual says no it's exact opposite actually because Spirit has desire because spirit is personal by Nature has desired of the body forms matter takes form according to the desire of spirit and we understand that so that and that it's all coming from one spiritual Source even ourselves even our own Consciousness even our own bodies even the world that we're moving through that it's all coming from the
then we're beginning to understand this Oneness you know and when we realize that if it's moving in harmony with that one
 then it's spiritual even if it's composed of the temporary material energy it's it's as good as spiritual you could say they really the essence of spirituality is that is moving in harmony with the Divine spirit and soul properties giving us a vision of how we can move how can spiritualize her entire life in a practical way
 I never text 34 from that great lotus flower Brahma was generated
 but Brahma certainly could see nothing but the lotus there for thinking you to be outside Lord remodeled into the water and attempted to find the source of the lotus for 100 years
 he could not find a trace of you however for when AC
fruit defies the Original Seed can cannot be seen now okay so so like it in other words if you want it like if you saw a big tree we're talkin about The Siege at this album seat yesterday right the tiny little delicate of thing right in the center of this
 very delicate light practically light is a little paper each kind of seed Packaging
 and
 that's the source of the huge elm tree in the butt if you see that the huge LG you'll never find the seed
 right but we should be able to
 I understand we should be able to to interpret this evidence that there is a seed that it was generated from read the commentary
call Sorella
 okay this is the description of the cosmic manifestation the development of the cosmic manifestation is like the fruit defecation of a seed when cotton is transformed into thread the cotton is no longer visible and when the thread is welcome to cloth the threat is no longer visible great analogy similarly it is perfectly correct that when we see
 that when the seed that had generated from the navel of carbon dioxide Vishnu became manifested as the cosmic creation one could no longer understand where the cause of the cosmic manifestation is modern scientists have tried to explain the origin of creation by a chunk Theory chunks plain how such a chunk might have burst
The Vedic literature have explains clearly that the total material energy was agitated by the three gunas because of the glance of the Supreme Lord in other words in terms of the chunk Theory or the Big Bang Theory the bursting of the chunk was caused by the Supreme personality of godhead that's one must accept the Supreme cause Lord Vishnu as the cause of all causes
 very very interesting okay
 Lord Vermont who celebrated as Tony
 having been born without a mother was struck with Wonder does he took shelter of the lotus flower and when he had been purified after undergoing severe austerities for many hundreds of years he can see that the cause of all causes the Supreme personality of godhead was spread throughout his own body and senses just as a Roma deliver
battle is perceived in Earth okay good now it seems like this in other words John Coltrane you know right nugget today Billy has millions of years later he's feeling something of this and playing it through his saxophone and people are saying what a record right like that really affected me that touched me that but it's but if we go back to the origin of the universe for mama is going through that same process in that same intuition in that same experience or I will promise like he's sitting alone in the darkness on the top of the lotus flower Shonda and what does he need to understand what's the origin where does it come from that's where the question is begin write what you know what started all this and so he's searching around is climbing down the stand me he can't find it
 but
sitting on that because back up to the top of the flower just like you didn't and probably sitting here just like you can't find the seed once the trees been grown he can't find the origin of it he comes back up there he sits down and here's the word syllable stop her and this is all secondhand to about what time we were this a long time ago Top Pot you practice austerity release me to practice or starting going to meditation you'll find your answers there by going Within
 and so that's what he does and then he begins to perceive what we're hearing here you know he begins to understand he could see that the cause of all causes the Supreme personality got it was spread right that that's what Vishnu means it is spread he's like pervades everything that's what the word volitional mean so he could feel he spread throughout my body right you spread throughout my body my senses just like in a subtle way you know what was that Coltrane said
 so
right so gently that we hardly even feel it yet is are everything
 and so he said I can feel it you know heating for my eyes feeling he's spread throughout my own body and my senses just isn't a wrong all the very subtle
 is perceived in Earth in improper to hear Isis
 fascinating sheriffs this in his commentary this really interesting idea he says this
 is a simile the Supreme Louis as the Supreme Lord buys different energies spread throughout one's Body and Soul although we cannot see him
 an intelligent person however can see the Supreme Lord existing everywhere
 I'm done today now we posted promised me tie this is this is Brahma sprayer right I'm done tourister put them on Orchard and the restaurant the Lord is within the universe and with I'm sorry.
is within the universe and within the atom
 he's inside the smallest thing he's outside the biggest thing right
 the Lord is within the universe and within the atom by his different energies this is the real vision of the Supreme Lord for the intelligent man or mob first created being became the most intelligent person buys the Pasha he wouldn't with anyone at the meditation place to pass your austerity and that she came to this realization we must therefore take all this knowledge from her mama
 who became Perfect by Sasha and others from my winnings for ma performed austerity and meditation on a level that we can't even imagine
 we don't even necessarily have to do that we just need to hear it from him you know what this is all about to get to 13 chapter where Krishna describes her joining other different ways people try to understand the part of Mama some do it through meditation Dianna Sunday
through sound catriona yoga some do it to carmillo and some dude simply by hearing that you can simply here by someone who has that realization there was listen to this right now this is another great example
 I think we actually I want to I want to know how much this is going to be the whole purpose okay he says here the statement of self-realization a Humper Moss me which is interpreted by the my body philosopher to mean I am the Supreme Lord is explained so say some people take these Vedic texts and explain that we are all that all pervasive energy
 and probably say no no you can understand it in the right context by reading was explaining this first the Supreme Lord is the Original Seed of everything and then he quotes they don't Asutra gen-mai Jesse at aha then it goes back to beat the alarm service your probable multi-serve a varsity
 both mean that
there's an origin to have you Christmas saying I am that origin and I penetrate everything
 everything comes from me that's the Supreme Lord extends everywhere even throughout our bodies because our bodies are made of material energy which is the Lord separated energy one should realize it since the Supreme Lord spreads throughout one's body and since the individual soul is a part of the Supreme Lord
 everything is Brahman now he's quoting this very important verse from the punishments are called The Dump, everything is Brahman we understand that is everything is the energy of the powder Brahmin everything is energy efficient or everything is energy of Krishna
 this realization was achieved by Lorde Ramat after he was purified and it's possible for everyone
 we had another clue to existence are right we purify ourselves of all the attachments and misconceptions and then we begin to understand
you won't even if you're the best most advanced materials scientist
 unless you become purified you going to see it when one is completely and knowledge of a Humber Moss me I am Spirit he thinks I am part part of the Supreme Lord my body is made of his material energy and therefore I have no separate existence yet although the Supreme Lord is spread everywhere
 he's different from me still right still I made of his energy One sensor one but still he's different
 he says this isn't this is the philosophy of
 attention beta beta Tampa
 an example now this is I think you're going to like this right now it's ready for another analogy here yep
 an example given in this regard is that of the aroma within the Earth that's what we just heard in the verse in the earth there are a Roma's and colors
the one can I see them
 are you looking do you do you do you dig into the Earth and you just see the brown dark dirt right but there's colors in there
 actually we find that when the flowers grow from the Earth Day. With different colors in a Roma's which they have certainly gathered from the earth although in the earth we cannot see them
 so we're looking and we're just seeing dirt we're just seeing brown but there's yellow and orange and red and pink and lavender and all the different colors are in there with the speak of the promise we don't see them but they're they're you don't receive them right but we can but when we see that the flower of manifesting is cuz we know that's probably where in the earth similarly the Supreme Lord by his different energy spreads throughout one's Body and Soul although we cannot see him
 and a tenth and what I read before Anna Todd
Asian person however can see the Supreme Lord existing everywhere the Lord is within the universe and within the atom buys different energies this is the real vision of the Supreme Lord for the intelligent person from all the first created being became the most intelligent person buys the Pasha austerity and thus he came to this realization we must therefore take all knowledge from Vermont who became Perfect by his depression secrets of the universe
 dropped into our laps just dropped and now spoken by Pearl are at the little boy standing for all the Davis and and giving the whole world you know thousands and thousands and thousands years later and understanding of its a manual for How the Universe functions what is its purpose how best to engage with it like like a knee apparatus like any well-designed complex apparatus comes with Emmanuel he's speaking that
the next verse Lord Rama could then see you possessing thousands and thousands of faces feet heads hands buys noses ears and eyes you are very nicely dressed being decorated and bedecked with varieties of ornaments and weapons seeing you in the form of Lord Vishnu your symptoms and form being transcendental your legs extending from your lower planets Lord Perma achieved Transit Dental list
 beautiful you know he's that he's the disciple of Naruto who is the disciple of Brahma so he's like he's talking about his put him right back and it's in any standing right there and he's hearing all this in little car lot is speaking about the Bliss of Lord, my dear Lord when you appeared as how are agreeable with the head of a horse you killed
demons known as model and kaitabha were full of the modes of passion and ignorance
 then you deliver The Vedic knowledge to Lord Vermont for this reason all the great Saints accept your forms as transcendental unchanged by material qualities
 new other forms we think of them as material their temporary their fault either fall apart your forms are not like that this way my Lord my Lord you appear in various incarnations of the human being as an animal is a great Saint is a demigod as a fish or as a tortoise must maintain in the entire Creation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles according to the edge on my Lord you protect the principles of Dharma in this age of Kali however you do not assert yourself as a supreme personality of God had and therefore you are known as tree yoga or the Lord who appears in three uses
I can assume that in the cometary to the dispersed the promising to speak about SRI chaitanya you know who is understood as the Kali Yuga avatara but he's like a hidden Avatar nice yeah he never asserted Opera boo boo piercing Kali Yuga as a supreme percent of God had never asserted himself as such on the contrary when she tell you about Harper Village address is being as good as Krishna he blocked his ears with his hands denying his identity with Krishna because you was playing the part of a devotee Laura to Tonia knew that in Kelly yoga there would be many bogus incarnations pretending to be God and therefore he avoided a certain himself as the Supreme personality of godhead or to Tanya is accepted as the Supreme person I've got had however in many Vedic literature especially the bottom of time to do this quote from the 11th can tell in Kali Yuga intelligent man worship the personality of God had in the form of lorr to Tanya
who's always accompanied by his associates such as nityananda a good way to get out hard tree box the entire Krishna Consciousness movement is based on this principle of the sun tear ton of movement inaugurated by Lorde chaitanya there for one who tries to understand the person I've got head through the medium of the sankertown movement knows everything perfectly he is made of a person with substantial intelligence so they're probably speaking as the external reason as to why the 4th you got bittar is secret is concealed but he's not there's a more esoteric reason is that cuz he's trying to relish the mood of a devotee right he's trying to relish the mood of rathaus
 so to think of himself or to be thought of in related to as God would would be going contrary to to him relishing that move
not being God being the volume, but that's so here when provide speaks of their three yoga avatars is because the third one is generally kept secret
 add an extra scoop of time for 11 more my dear Lord of Dykes in the planets where there is no anxiety my mind is extremely simple and Lusty has five being sometimes so-called happy and sometimes so-called distressed my mind is full of lamentation and fear and it always seeks more and more and more money
 sounds like my kid less it becomes more polluted and is that ever satisfy you and therefore most fallen in such a status of life may be able to discuss your activities this is the process of self-realization we start to notice. How great we are all the time and brag about our self just such an ugly cry
we start to see how far we are and as people advance in their bhakti they're less bragging about their spiritual light in men and now their insight into people and they start to see their shortcomings and we hear the songs by great Masters and they they share how far they are from God and they said that they share it and it's not like because they're self-deprecating I hate themselves it's a reality we are far from God and we are covered with so much allusion and we have so we're still in a material condition and it's and it's an honesty that comes when we when we make Advance when a bhakti otherwise people tend to think I'm very spiritual and I'm very spiritual person yet we are riddled with material qualities material desires
 Miss Mara it is time
 time for a takeaways
it starts as a vague intuition there something more that it becomes your everything
 okay anywhere you look you will find a Love Supreme
 it's intuitive that the planet has its own life cycle
 okay play the original cause of everything is Vishnu
 Krishna Consciousness spiritual eyes is this material world
 like that understand the big elm tree came from a tiny delicate seed
 Brahma is going through the same process as John Coltrane
 he just did it first notice how far we are from God for real self realization
when we start to become God conscious we are not as affected by the material world
 Krishna is the Unseen original cause just like the seed is the Unseen cause of the huge tree
