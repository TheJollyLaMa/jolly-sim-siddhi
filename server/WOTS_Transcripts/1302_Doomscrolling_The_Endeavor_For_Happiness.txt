 Set a nugget today runners
 what's going on with the Nugget today differently every day we have some like little thoughtful can size piece of information from certain Western literature often times we pull it out and you can find how it goes hand-in-hand with some Eastern thought and all I saw was that you sent me a Tik Tok video I was like what is going on with cuz you didn't watch it though I did not I don't have a Tik-Tok app and therefore I couldn't see it that's what you need okay yeah I saw it originally on Instagram but then I couldn't locate it there and then I Googled it and then I found it on Tik Tok okay searching for Tik Tok videos vert on Google OK Google
 two really important counterintuitive spiritual theme
that intuitive spiritual themes tell me when we get back in the bottle with time today little prod little five-year-old Mahajan great great teacher Bucky he's going to speak about this idea
 he says it it really if you if you can hear it and take it in it can be life-changing but he's saying that as soon as we tried that the world is designed in a particular way there laws in effect here we we we may be unaware of them but if work if we look we'll see it all over the place and he's saying that as soon as you start your material Endeavor to find happiness through material external things at the moment it starts backfiring and it brings you some stuff for the other grass is our endeavors for happiness
doesn't think like that wise person has it's a whole different Paradigm a different idea about life and what it's meant for it and how to pursue it now what I wanted to bring to your attention today with the tick tock I think you're going to like this right now cuz I see you post things like this on your own you're into that all your into all that stuff like I remember those from 1972 like we don't see these anymore like you to help me into that stuff so this one is all about that but here's the thing
 it's it was posted by someone that's called 80 80s 80s
 so 80s Denise but it's spelled e e e and I what she posted she said what is called his reasons growing up Gen X made us patient
okay she's going to be like I can't understand why I have a whole bunch of Harry Krishna followers all the stuff
 answer my butt when I saw this in my mind I connected to that principle that provide was teaching because it's showing all these outdated things that new things have been invented we don't have to wait around for things like we used to before
 we would think that that would make us happier right oh I don't have to wait and Rewind a tape to listen to it again right when you and I were growing up we would listen to tapes and when the table comes in then you have to hit rewind you have to wait there for a while till the same was rerouted again nowadays you just got on your phone when you click click click can you bounce around that so yeah right you see I told you get excited with you anywhere in the song but here's my point right now
not get too caught up in a minute just make a point is that the idea was going to be better we're going to be happier but at the same time there's a subtle effect there and he's beginning to pile up where our minds become more impatient and when our minds are impatient of we can't find happiness we've actually become Disturbed very easily sure I want to hear I want it now isn't it here why is it now yeah and so did it make us happier or did soon as we started endeavoring for a material happiness did it actually become the cause of my suffering so let's go through them together I'm going to just going to play the video of myself it's kind of a static it just sits photos with captions on top so I'll just go get him so reasons why growing up Genex I'm going to last location via okay thank you like it when you're done you posted on the board for either Tik-Tok users okay so the first one it said it it shows a picture of a Rubik's Cube
spent hours trying to solve this I never did but go on and said we had to rewind these to listen to our favorite song again yeah I had to say and then it would stop it right where the break in the music was that was good I don't remember that you don't think that happens I don't think that ever happened like hopefully you hit it was almost like playing like a slot machine like please stop right at the beginning of the song latika that was my cheap ones Maxell were the ones that had the lady singing
 images that you can break glass with it that was their claim to fame she used to be able to break glass with her voice and the Ella Fitzgerald or something Ella Fitzgerald that's right okay so then we're going to the excitement about
next one was that it showed the same tape but all chewed up and it said we had to carefully fix are eating tapes. Don't remind me you were supposed to taste like alcohol and rub it on like that the heads of the washing the dishes playing SS decontrol and all the sudden she like we going to run and pick up your cassette to digital up and you got to get a pencil and kind of roll the thing try to flatten it out it's never the same after that okay next one
 is renting a movie meant leaving the house first and it showed like a
 best Blockbuster store Be Kind Rewind to go do you have to wait on television and hope that it would come out right yeah
but then Blockbuster you'd have to go to the store and pick it up now days on Netflix you just need to lie down in my old age I wish I could have the hours back I spent walking around a blockbuster and then they of course they have the secret room that was creepy okay next and then it shows MTV so we waited all day to watch her favorite video that I was not like you just go on YouTube and you just pick what you want you to have to sit there and oh yeah that's right you have to wait there like I said we search for numbers in the phone book okay well I guess people Google I don't know if it's once that Monday I you don't search for you to find a phone book and got this big one of your live in New York and yeah forget it
my friends in Alabama how do I get that phone number okay thanks see we called the movie theater to get showtimes
 play the newspaper of the newspaper well that's the next thing says or looked in the newspaper yep I remember we used to get to get the apartment in New York City what would you do to get an apartment to go to the Village Voice and when any on Wednesday morning either Wednesday or Thursday night Tuesday night when I first start delivering the newspapers know do you go Tuesday night to wear their own place like where it originated would write them Lafayette Street and then and then you could be the first to see the first in the first parents they ran a newspaper and they got out just in time I got out just in time we got to try to stay focused yet
record me you could you like it's just like you there's a million possibilities for squirrels in this conversation okay then looked in the newspaper but I was sitting in relation to this when we get an apartment we would get the Village Voice and we just give you the smallest little information on that apartment nowadays you go to like streeteasy or some website like I'm you can see all the photos of it you see videos of it because you know we would have to get that little information and then go to that place and see it and set an appointment and in all that time I don't watch anything until I see a trailer is the only way to see a trailer back then was you have to sit in the movie and all the sudden somebody comes on a dial telephone speed dial
 not even remember that I had nine in my number growing up if you screwed up 9 you have been 10 years old from Lebanon
you will never know the pain of having nine in your phone number. Okay, shows like the house is here are going to easy
 dial that number for vinyl record being played we listen to the whole song
 assume people still vital records in a great records I've lost do that that's the thing is you wouldn't you is not that we listen to Hillsong you listen to whole record you would just bounce back and forth cuz it takes time to get the record output on that you listen to Let It Go you new in order and how the songs went in your mind after one song ended you would hear the next song coming in your mind right okay next time we're going to shows like four rolls of film and it says we had to wait a week to see the photos we took it was expensive to it was expensive it was expensive like nothing on my
call Black I might hand you know taking a photograph of the different thing back then you had to you know it was expensive it was time consuming you had to like do it more thoughtfully right okay I could have just like rattle off thousands of selfies watching a home video was a long process that she was a camera and the whole thing you got to set that unit up over your family. We stuck to slide shows that has a thing about TV Guide we had to wait a week if we had to wait a week to see the next episodes right now days you just been to get the whole downloaded at 1 so the new season of whatever came out you just put it onto the whole thing of when they were supposed to Seasons that you would watch the reruns in the second half of the Season you got to wait till Autumn before you get the new seed extract I took over to the whole season of everything was Manuel and it shows a window unit for car the the cranks the crank up a crank down the window ever been with
Sarge we got to crank up the window it's exhausting some of them were heart making the perfect mixtape are games to deep concentration that got the game so whatever I will send my friend this this nugget is getting me anxious and exhausted from thinking about all the stuff I used to have to do okay with just hollering actually we're almost here from this finding a topic for a book report took work and it shows in a cyclopedia you know what how you do it now
 chat g p t I don't know if your phone will write it for you well because of all the fake rocket up books out there now all you got to do because I'm a public person now used to say I want 100 pages about Ray cappo write me a book about 100 pages of rape
Please Be Kind Rewind thing didn't remind rewind this was our GPS and it shows like a map a paper map you know you fold out map
 and then three words you're going to love this one right now three words TGIF
 that's not even one word
 okay go on Dewey Decimal System ohmigod. It's exhausting the guy pulling out that thing besides Sherri onica listen to show every day does anybody else go to the library our people are our kids
 are they happier now than they were when we were growing up are we I think so I think they are for the hundred
steak healthy the more frustrated a little lazier a little lazy here let's get up and go they can be very very isolated if you have some kids it's a little introverted they can live their whole life in their room that happens a lot and you know it it's it's rare when you see people who are sort of like getting into the kids getting into their creativity it will especially I'm not even blaming the parents up bring it I mean blaming the kids it's it's almost like saying
 I'm going to distribute free crack and cocaine to everybody and I got a few things and and we're addicted to were dictated to the time-saving and it just gets me more and more anxious this whole I want it now is ruining our tolerance level in from tolerance and from patients come choices made in the mode of goodness
you see this was part of the whole The Vedic approach was that you had brahmins in society this is why you hear about commitments important commitment so important how I thought we were having a conversation
 call Mandy
 but my point was you know the way in the world that we live in right now isn't this kind of it's a free market which has its advantages and it has its disadvantages it's great for creativity you know inventiveness and so on sure but but it actually has a way of you know it's blowing the crack into the into society no way to Reign it in there have to be some adults it's a you know what this may have it may seem like it's temporarily going to bring us some some convenience or some temporary happens but in the long run these things are piling up and they're having a negative effect what are we going to do about it in our side there's nothing to
about it practically right through the crowd to Runaway Train you got to just desperately try to train your selves train at French train your children
 you don't think I'm addicted to scrolling but I remember the days where you can just go to the bathroom now it's like it's a hole in their am I the only person to break your phone in the bathroom I want I want I want I want a I want a the chat board I want to hear this on the chat board we don't need someone I want you to be honest I'm very vulnerable right now I want you to be honest if your role in the bathroom thank you Kimmy Karol thank you course my kids love going to the library is that the teaching your kids how to use a loom or something

 Rich Roll podcast
 Arete read it for the shoe my pocket Tom
 this is a good one reason she might become can't 27 chapter 7 text 40 or back okay so quick you know it's been awhile since we've been here
provide describe bhakti to his little friends okay
 Nanny started doing with the bog time does again and again and again recognize us a comparison
 between the purest intention intentions is purely loved and then layers of selfishness that are mixed into the spiritual path as aspects of the spiritual passive recognize ourselves centered slightly selfish motives
 accommodates them to some degree but get you moving a little forward sure where is Pure Body doesn't accommodated at all. He's like eliminated get it to the pure level where your cable bill a love so so he described the whole practice of buck teeth up into the Palm readers with describing someone who's just like Channing Christmas themes and tears are coming from their eyes and invoices choke him to dancing
oblivious to how others see them or judge them and then he started comparing it to Kiana to the results again what does this deliver the results of temperatures of Liberation is only that comes automatically you get that you get more than that from Pure Bucky and then cuz you get love you got the deepest farm and now he's going to speak about, how, fall short how all the things of this world and then you can get into our endeavours to the things in this world how they all fall short so far short of of did the the experience of pure body appear love so we're going to hear about that now and what is the text 39 or 40 bus 40
 it is learned from basic literature that by performing great sacrifices when they elevate himself to the Heavenly planets okay that's that's what we're saying but the earlier teachings that accommodate your selfishness, at your material desires
that statement alone so fascinating Heavenly planets are there they're just aliens and us we're dealing here with us where the aliens although life on the planet is thousands of times more comfortable than life on Earth is not amazing to think like an imagine think about the best pleasure you've had a material world like in your life but the mall has write my pleasure you've had whatever that is
 tablet it's hot as yours in your body
 everything but your body
better you don't like imagine if you just ate like lettuce what explorers were sent out by Kings and their scents Define spices and herbs and different fruit tree and come back with a new spices that wall where we live everything tastes better so so we're always trying to upgrade our sense gratification but the talk about other other planes of existence or says Grand Vacation is so high I used to it
 okay let's not get too into that let's keep going with the rest of ya Emily planted hundreds and thousands of times more comfortable than life on Earth the Heavenly planet
are not fewer near malam or free from the taint of material existence you know
 the Heavenly planets are also temporary and therefore they are not the goal of Life know these kids their their parents these high-level demons are single we can conquer planets we can achieve higher level you know sure thing. It's just like you're born wealthy if your kids go to Ivy League schools do if your kid gets expensive cars when they graduate or something when they turn 16 actual pleasure I know the richest kids that went to my school
 not all of them more expensive drugs graduating class were all drinking beer out of a keg but these guys had cocaine
I really think you're actually helping everybody with money shoving money in their pockets and Heavenly planets are also temporary and therefore they are not the goal of life in the Supreme personality of God had Whoever has never been seen or heard to possess any Bertie consequently for your own benefit and self-realization you must Worship the Lord with great devotion as described in the revealed scriptures so he's he's trying to weaken there any faith they have that their happiness we found through material game even if you gain the highest level material gain in the higher planets in the universe is not satisfied in the in the cometary proper does a big zoom out zoom out in terms of time let's let's look at let's examine if if I just look at my life right here at the service level might seem like these things will make me happy.
ancient inside time in in in terms of errors that people you know that that Humanity passes through says the history of this world has factually proved that attempts to increase economic development for Bali Comfort through the advancement of material civilization have done nothing to remedy the end of it the inevitability inevitability inevitability of ability inevitability of death old age and disease what are they in Sanskrit Mara
 you know that do you know that one
 electricians parents death
old age like Chara and disease disease
 if you already do contortion darshanam
 okay learn how learn it from era estefani okay it's on nothing all this all this attempt to advance ourselves to material advancement they've done nothing to remedy these four difficulties of Life everyone has knowledge of a huge Empire throughout history of the world the Roman Empire the Mughal Empire the British Empire
but all the societies engaged in such Economic Development have been frustrated by the laws of nature periodic Wars pestilence famine and so on. All their attempts have been flickering and temporary in this verse therefore it is said one team are Marty Asia
 keyot premium chilaka one may be very proud of possessing a vast Empire but such a are in permanent after 100 or 200 years everything is finished
 now from now for lot's going to go to the Press now thank you he's we going to begin to encourage us to develop an attitude of Simplicity that actually is not through running after the the satisfaction material desires sense gratification said that's going to bring happiness a wiser person is going to begin to flow
send developing Simplicity text 41 materialistic person thinking of some very Advanced and intelligent continually acts for economic development but again and again as enunciated in The Vedas you're frustrated by material activities either in this life or the next indeed the results one obtains are inevitably the opposite of those one desires will just make everything easier to make everything more convenient that's going to make us happier you do that again that's like a really we spoke about this on the show before right but
 I think the title of the show was something like this isn't if you weren't there that was the one where I think you just saw
 you went out or something like that I had to do the show by myself like yeah you got to put maybe when you're in go or some of that wonderful thing look good I miss you I think you I think you and I did discuss it
before you got cut off was this wasn't the future that we want to work with this is with this AI thing right back when we were kids everyone was saying before work is like back in the fifties and sixties and seventies it was like these things are going to keep on if we could see like things are being invented and develop quicker than ever in our psyche all we're going to do things so we don't have to work so much we have all this free time to pursue the things in life that we really have interest in the Arts and the fun things and more time with the family and all that you know and then now we're actually in that age where you have chat GPT and you have a i and all of this and what's happening is AI is creating the art
 write better than the artist well I don't know about that but end and we're working longer hours than ever before like how did that happen
ridiculous you know now that you know people used to leave work and that was it
 I'm leaving work today I'm out today and they had time we remember we have the whole episode on tinkering when they used to leave work in that was it that was before cell phones and for emails and become more texts now you leave work and you're still working late into the day cuz people work and now I'm texting you reaching out with turn it off we don't have more if you tell me the best free time
 I think so right now your appointment I want to hear what it was no I don't care that one 44-42 every material desires to achieve happiness and diminishes the stress seems reasonable and therefore he acts accordingly actually however what is happy as
long as one does not endeavor
 for happiness why you happy once you knew that endeavor for it and as soon as one begins his activities for happiness he condition his conditions of distress begin ouch that's why when there when you know if you believe in the world like they're six people running this entire planet if you're if you come in that they swing you over yet or I could be there quickly but I'm just saying even if you believe that there are a few puppeteers controlling everything this is Eric Jerome scrolling you're taking all this controlling the Republicans and the Democrats hate each other and they're sitting up and they're stockpiling gold and their information feeding everybody disinformation if you believe and they're all in it together and a creating false
anyway if you believe that still no one can be happy unless there's something
 if you want to be happy it doesn't matter how much money you have how much control you have your say so you saying even though six people even that it's six people who have everything the only way to be happy is if your Suffolk so you always have to like raise your Consciousness as being satisfied right it means like satisfied simply great devotees who had everything but they weren't attached to it that's the difference from that set book comes happiness it's just a study of the 14th chapter of the book of Akita and once you start thinking I could I want to acquire more when you're in your into robbed us and then there's always distress and to really be happy you have to become but you have to beat you have to be connected with divinity if you're not
connected with divinity then even in your Vic life they'll be some lamentation of I'm losing this I'm going to lose that I'm getting older I'm going to lose that I'm losing my beauty I'm losing my hair I'm losing my inability to walk or run or exercise or do this thing's I love ride a mountain bike down huge hills I'm losing all that ability that is going to also be gone and when you're connected to God then even if the shedding of the body is almost like you're detached from it that because you understand there's a butterfly growing out of that corpse metamorphosis is that a record store cocoon
 an hour to Six Forks are corpse is a cocoon of the butterfly butterfly the soul and improvised getting to something he's going to he's going to start to lay out a radical approach to how to approach life in the in the following verses
sticking just working with this one a bit more
 this idea what did he say again that he says however one is happy as long as one does not Endeavour for happiness as soon as one begins his activities for happiness and that meaning I'm searching for external happiness right I'm searching for I'm trying to make myself happy through external thing soon as you begin that trying to adjust the world for that right is right at that very point
 that there were the conditions of distress begin right there I think the way how proud pie presents our philosophy is he saying the moment that we want that everything changes when we enter into the material realm and we'd begin to suffer right so but both like macro and micro this principle place up on a mi amor micro-level you know there's this story that shared sometimes Within
 they don't take or we would let say like
you do kind of like with in side of circles side of circles tell me the sound a circle has a story about this simple
 Brahmin
 right is is he's got no family everything is as simple as can be his only possessions or is he's got his Copans right as quick opens are like this loincloth thing you got right it's just like two little strips of cotton right and you wash one and you hang up to dry you're wearing the other ones and then you flip it the next day you wear them I used to I used two of them. Some still do. It's been awhile so now
 he's happy
 you know he's happy it living by the edge of the river do meditating on his mantras and doing his meditations and we're half
pink opens this A happy a little problem came along I moused would eat away when he's got that one pair of Copeland's drying yeah I don't know if we start to eat away at the Copans and I guess it became like chronic an issue if you don't have it like that pair Copans is like you might not have another pair of 50 starts at 2 not sure so what does he do soon as he said I need to plan to attend a hat hat hat we get where this is going what you get a cat to get cat toys how old is getting more comedy litter and right but also the cat needed milk
 you have to feed that cat cats like milk so now would you be willing to go to get a cow or you just go to the 270 frog become an issue
so that he ended up getting a wife you know what the milk the cow to take care of the cow's hooves things like this and now has wife has gone get a job get a house get all these turns out it just like if I got married are you see how there's the principle is we can complicate for a little thing we can complicate our lives a lot and you can choose
 occurrences that her mom and dad did a drama of that little Sable Circle story and if you have the charger says Rock enough is asking us to Ghana International podcast what kind of fun are you and Miguel I forget sometimes you forget
spiritual point of it sometimes we can look into the lives of other people it's easier to see where I'd like they're complicating there like they wanted to get more shoes and then they got more shoes they had to get more of this and had to get more of that and let you know it's like and then you got a house full of junk and you know now you need a bigger house so I can let me buy this latest phone over now I got to get the latest software for it and that's changing over quicker to know let me buy a new camera roll.
 Every time every time you hit that pitch it is it if we don't hear anything but at least we don't have a really nice way to go outside this Camp okay alright continue this team
tomorrow and he's going to deal with some like radical new approach has understanding one's body and one's life with this kind of higher principle that he's been enunciated a now would be the time for some takeaways okay
 what are the punch out for you with those yeah Throwbacks just as soon as you Endeavor for happiness it begins to backfire change your algorithms
 our material advancements are in alleviating birth death old age and disease diseases still
creative as penicillin every time they cure one disease a new one pops out like a walk amole it's wack a disease
 all our Empires are finished in a century or two
 turn on the chat. Very good. A wise person develops Simplicity true true
 this AI isn't the future we hoped for more disappointed if I walked in the Facebook guy
Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg just a China promises to visit going to just make life so much better
 yeah right what come on it's clean up the environment please clean up the oceans you make that only plastic bottles will make the world better place
 we can't sell that for a small thing we can really complicate our lives or small thing little thing
 where do squirrel in my dreams squirreling underwear
