 all right that's good man that they need meetings there all bottled up
 they can't share and be vulnerable I don't put man in a little box to see if it's really that we know at every woman on here now is that okay
okay my phone
 we have a nugget for you
 come on
 pull the trigger problem album this is maybe this was spoken by more do you know anything about Tuesdays with Morrie writing to you know I started reading and I was just like I'm not going to do this tell me about it I don't know so much but I got it right here Tuesdays with Morrie
 it came out in 97 it was the Chronicles an important relationship in Mitch albom's life the one between himself and his old college professor more free
 as they reconnect during the professor
final months of Life they discuss everything from greed and forgiveness to death and a meaningful life I think this has been called the the world's best-selling Memoir was just something for you to aim for you now that yours is coming out right really how about a punk chipmunk getting started working on it so apparently no like it I think Maury was like a sociology professor and he just had his you know his insights into life and make a chair to the book parent so let's hear I assume this is what Maury was say
 but here's a part of the problem is that everyone is in such a hurry people haven't found meaning in their lives so they're running all the time looking for it they think the next you hard the next house the next job
then they find these things are empty too and they just keep running shelter said it many years before
 Freddie Mercury died of doing nothing maybe Maury was listening to shelter you know what you'd be surprised who listen to Selfie sociological sociology professors in the heart of what we're talking about yesterday how there is no map people have no map they don't know what direction they don't even know there is a map know that life is has a purpose they're just real like it's like here's life create a purpose out of it but according to the Bay this and all the great acharya's all the great Masters I hid there is a purpose there is a direction there is there is a train track and an arrow to follow and yeah we've created a busyness before we have Direction
that's like saying
 drive before we don't even know the direction to drive in before we even have a compass or GPS evil those kind of things like philosophy that not important of the Arts they're not important right understand why do we live in Viber in this world that's not important so I can figure out how to make money so you can get stuff this stuff will make you happy that we talk about these things used to would learn how to think, think yeah I've been going to be a Perry Christian at least figure out where we want to go where we where the ladder of success is meant to bring us now that you're climbing the ladder first figure out what successes
 what you know I'm hard so fast what I couldn't help but think of whenever this or people they haven't found meaning in their lives so they're running all the time looking for it they think the next car the next house the next job
then you got those things you work hard to get them sacrifice a lot then they find these things are empty to
 and then you keep on it unless the musketeer right there you know trying to find the sent out there but it's actually right in their little that musk koroma is what within the Zone Cooley
 oh man
 it's hard to pull yourself together and just hide the body of the deer okay yeah sort of like
 Mom type of way and it said the deer has it has it has a gland
 yeah you missed this enchanting Aroma do we tell you
yes I told me yesterday got a little of Guru oil are you got real from Aunt Regina so I mean
 that's illegal I've had I've held real musk in my hand before like the organ that it comes from you think I'm going to just any Russia K street vendor know my friend I was given I was shown that where can you get it it's a legal binding Hunters on this is me you're talking to how you don't think I got any juice in this town
 now this is it by this man whose like he's very close
I would like the in the mud with some poor guy is like way up there is very close with the with the seniority that are like the leaders of the motive of supper. And he's got this elaborate who just set up and you started breaking out everything including that mosque in this man would not settle
 or any substitute excuse that I that I've touched it and you haven't asked man that's illegal you can't get most of its from 1936 he probably got it from the same guy that I got it from you may be a bit bigger than the deer has his clan that's in mrs. beautiful fragrance I can chanting fragrance
I mean it's not in if it's a strong fragrance it's not like Jasmine if it's overpowering it's like it's captivating and
 search for guitars it out and it's searching here and certain that it's not finding it anywhere and so that's that's the deal this is reality this is Maury he was onto something you understood it
 we shouldn't let our days go by
 without inquiring into the meaning of life without digging deeper and without and we should wise up
 and realize that external things do not deliver they don't deliver the happiness they don't deliver the meaning they don't deliver the satisfaction that we're looking for that's something we find inside Revenue which means you won't even find it on the chat board no matter
how long you stare at it it's not the hurricane Henry wrote me a private message that Maury is this devotee that we know Uncle me and Mary had it had a nephew that said devotee yeah see that that's like that's just like that's just like 12 to 42 degrees of separation right there separation would be the devoted and then the second degree would be more e
 2 degrees C degrees all right but you know this is going to happen cuz we're going to hear some Choice versus from little sweet deeply devoted deeply realize little boy provide today too
Vine is very good
 something very profound to say now I forgot it so he'll come back
 the deer the must have hidden it leave it right there
 random the Mesquite Tiana Rancho Bernardo tell me what should offer respectful of Mason cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan untune are in a Ryan Rishi the super most human being into mother sarswati the goddess of learning and she'll be off today of the author not stop right here is about all that is troublesome to the heart
eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised the transcendental songs be established as a revocable fact Lucaya text you the minute I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's after Lotus feet here's what I was going to say this important I told you to come back you know you can't
 is it this is a problem that we were running around busy doing nothing and then we think you know what my whole life I just been busy you know what I have to do I have to do nothing and this is what people do either in retirement or they do it when they get some midlife crisis and they quit their busyness and end up just dealing
 nothing and they'll immense because they realize now what's life's purpose
and it doesn't necessarily bring them to God it brings them to you know I'm going to downsize I'm going to cash out I'm going to move to the you know you know move to Central America I'm going to just start surfing again and often times that has no purpose also it's just slower and so I think when people are real Dewar's in the world that's not a bad thing and I just want to emphasize that but it's it's the why behind we're doing I don't think people are professionals and busy and really have a brain that can expand and control so many things I don't think that's a bad thing and he got to kill that part of yourself you just saying that because there is a busyness in that and people like you know what I just got to eat I'm just saying don't be busy I know I know I know I know I know I understand that but we can fall into that thing two thing
that just quitting busyness is spiritual and I'm not necessary spiritual I thank you for clarifying that we're going to
 okay so are you going to shoot my Bob and Tom Canto 7 chapter 5 text 2500 you were zone out yesterday cuz you're hammered I'd we finish the we finished it all you did you okay
 crazy
 I resent that rug and I keep moving on without me like that sorry you know the whole but okay alright then we're on the Texas right now
 sounds like I said anything quite profound
but I did wind it up okay good I wanted to wind it up so I appreciate that you do that so now we're now now prahlada said what he said that he gave the answer the nine processes of ocean service was his favorite thing that he's learned his father is going to freak out earlier that is not that's not good news
 okay and anybody could ask the fourth question today. 4th
 okay
 after hearing these words of devotional service or the mouth of his son prologue already got you poo is extremely angry his lips trembling he spoke as follows too son. I was a teacher the son of his Guru supercharger imagine how terrifying it must have been to look into the face of your any part in his lip is trembling and anger yeah yeah sure
 drive to look at my father's face when he got out of there
he's not even stand up a brahmana you have disobeyed my order in taking shelter but party of my enemies who is chastising the teacher you have taught this poor boy about what is this nonsense I mean of course running has your poo is on the level where he just
 he thought himself above everyone but it is the son of his Guru you know like supercharger I was powerful
 I wonder exactly how her any cuz she poo
 related to sugar chart
 maybe just saw him is like I could just replace this guy's does his rituals I don't want to speculate speculate
in due course of time various types of diseases are manifest in those who are simple
 I've heard similarly in this world there are many deceptive brands in fall garbs
 looking around but eventually because of their false Behavior there actually at their actual enmity becomes Manifest this is total paranoia because these teachers didn't have anything to do with it no they would have done whatever he said but he just happened to be born a devotee had nothing to do here with these teenagers to be clear not wanting to serve her any cashew Pooh honey cuz she was wanting to get materialistic answers out of his son and his son keeps coming back with these pure bhakti yoga answers and he's upset with the teachers it must be the teachers that are teaching this where else is it going to come from and so he's taking it out of the teachers although it's really not it wasn't them that it was that they were
can't figure this bhakti thing out it seems like you do everything right and the kids turn out not right you know the Instagram ad she shows up might even know what anything about party she just came from her name is Maya and I'm a card-carrying Harry Krishna I've been trying to like jump through hoops to get my kids such a holy name and my two shows out of nowhere with an Instagram ad I can't figure this stuff out
 so I'll let's hear supercharger boost spiritual Master with the some supercharged supercharger is the spiritual Master the son of secret area who is who is Hermione costume Guru Superman set
 enemy of King and Rowe King whatever your son prolonged has
said was not taught to him by me or anyone else was it me
 a spontaneous box he has naturally developed in him there for please give up your anger and do not unnecessarily accuse us it is not good to insulted brahmanan this way pulling that old brown card at play the Brahma card dealing from the bottom of a deck
 United money continued when hiranyakashipu received this reply from the teacher he again adjust to suck excuse me his son for a lot of said Rascal most falling of our family it's only 5 years old cums Slack
 you rascal most Fallen of our family if you have not received this education from your teachers where have you gotten it
 so he just he flipped quick there you know he's angry and angry at his kid to kid
it's the kid blame the kid now that was the fourth question Corona
 if you have not received this education from your teachers where have you gotten it
 and now this could be three or four versus here
 that are you know legendary you know giving giving clear Lucid insight into the nature of this world's that we're moving through and how we relate to it a lot is a legend legend one of the 12 epic epic Legend because of their uncontrolled senses persons to listen to this slow down slow down the road on the trigger trigger because of their own
census persons to addicted to material life make progress towards hellish conditions and repeatedly to that which is already been chewed your inclinations towards Krishna are never aroused either by the instructions of others by their own efforts or by a combination of both Souza great one I've used the gas line in a song chewing the chewed chewing the two that brightness to give a kid a piece of gum they chew the gum that there's no flavor left and they got your dad you want my gum and they're like offering it back it's got no flavor at this point that they say is the material world material world is hey you do something that's exciting
 and then you do it again in the flavors all in all ass excited
let him after a while it's like that same thing that was really exciting is not boring that's why there's a bucket list because after you do it on the buckets like okay and I don't have to do that again you know it's it's only they say in spiritual life that is Everfresh spiritual it becomes Everfresh it doesn't get I've been to bring David them and go over downhill many many times that flavor doesn't come out if it's more flavorful add you to it yeah it's like a gum that gets better tasting than that, it's like juicy or fruit Bubblicious as you go Max to think about all the things that should get dry if you think about it when I was little I remember that I don't know if you must remember this a good song was on the radio you would go out and buy the single people don't do that now but you died the single I want to get the single and want to plugs and you play that single a thousand times
until you were repulsed by that saw that same song as like number one song in that you're repulsed by that very same song because it doesn't have that I can't stand the test of time so to speak maybe you can revisit it in like a year six months or 10 years but for the most part things get stale and things get dry higher-quality things in goodness they can't stand the test of time a little bit longer but the same thing if you think about what you and I did every day while we lived in an awesome everyday we wake up that you know for 4 in the morning 3:30 in the morning and we go sing a song the song to the good in every Temple there's morning songs you sing and what is that song it's just like a little simple Melody everyday that you saying it's sometimes not even if you see in a different Melly everybody's looking like your what are you doing what are you do what you can't change it change
not even though it's not like your singing with like a variety of either it sometimes like the worst singer in the temple is singing it so it's not like some like what a great singer it sometimes allows a singer but everyday you are there for that same song and it never gets old songs and you're sitting in the same one summer could argue alert change it up let somebody else sing it sometimes there was a temple singing hog as well we won't get into that and when the one guy that sang it everyday but for the most part it's the same exact song same exact Melody and every day and you don't it doesn't get old you don't go wide to try to let's try another song Today same songs everyday you don't have to go why but these songs you go deep with you songs
 thank you yes so you know this is real
it would Maury was saying they think the next car they think they never had one car I chewed it up got some juice you know but then I'm chewing the chewed I need another car but even getting another car is another way of chewing that you'd you know and another house I need another job. I have a client that two Lamborghinis you can have one Lamborghini had two Lamborghinis but he says but then they find that these things are empty to is no juice left at the juice has been chewed out of their empty keep running so so little prayer loud
 he's saying this you know because the senses are uncontrolled until the senses are controlled there's no satisfaction
 only when the census only when we've learned to control our senses when we've learned that I'm not getting satisfied this way but the sensors are pulling me to get more
external more externals more externals but it's still not delivering satisfaction how long will I keep following this path that That Is Random programming in my mind is a habitat has me convinced to keep following can I recognize this just so little juice in this and you shoot a little bit and it's gone and you keep chewing and keep showing and keeps you you know what I think is a valuable what could be a valuable exercise first one I put this in your mind is said to have chewing the chewed keep that in your head right I act like I do all the time and then goes to a 24-hour.
 And ask yourself at this moment am I chewing the tude am I trying to get some flavor out of something where I've done it and because it's a material thing it had maybe a little juice the beginning but I still do you know when I'm scrolling through Instagram
what I find is when I get there now I get to this point where my that was absurd that we don't know. Like that's part of it or should I say do you have some of the stuff is just like it's almost like insulting to the intelligence you know cuz it is they're just silly wacky dumb things that are just trying to catch our attention just trying to get us to click just checking out just trying to get it in like four just sounded like we're just here to increase their algorithm or something like that now I'm now I'm following a lot of
recipes and also follow it like a natural cleaning products believe it or not cuz I isn't deeply satisfying it's interesting it's informative but but I get the idea of a scrolling itself is chewing that which is it's exhausting and it doesn't make you feel good about yourself you just make you feel good about yourself so people aren't you doing that you're chanting the same Mantra everyday you know milk some pleasure out of it and the answer is no there there actually is yes or no that there actually is pleasure there it is the same thing you are trying to be you aren't showing up every day doing the same thing but there's pleasure there but this is what the acharya's and this is what this was the Atari say the master say but they all but there's actually experienced also said that's why sometimes we could just sit there and so-called do nothing except hear the Holy Name
pictures of thing is as long as our mind and senses are are plugged in and we can't shake them it's like you know it's like you can't shake it off you know Shake It Off from like that pursue love external satisfaction until we can shake that off we're not able to go deep within on anything meaningful but if you can if you can get if you can you can let that go then these deeply spiritual things you find it no matter how as you're saying no matter how much you bring your mind back to its you start to go deeper into it and realize just how special it is it's the gum that gets juicier as you go in we read last week this statement by sure the bug by to talk or remember this one about he said I was really think I've been thinking about this a lot this is real important to those
 bhakti practice
is out there if you are a Bucky practitioner write if you're like the yes that is my practice I'd I don't only find it interesting or peeling or I don't only believe that there's truth in it but I actually practice it I don't want this love the food so it so if you practice it he split he said was that he was talking about how when we chant his name it shouldn't just it's not it's not just a sound that's created by the Tongue in the lips right you saying it's not just lift eat that's not if you're chanting on just that level of making this sound vibration with the mouth
 that's actually not the spiritual substance that's not actually krishna's name that's just that's kind of like a Monday and sound like it's just sound it's just the same kind of material energy is anything else he said that this name it descends from the spiritual realm and enters the heart and then from the heart you chanted
and then as that passes through the tongue in the lips when it's hard to keep not lifting that that's actually Chris's name that that transformative super-powerful Bubblicious ever-increasing what is it you know like that that's the nature of that squirt gun up in the margin on Beau Rivage a video of original it's an ever-increasing ecstasy so I was thinking about the two how does it descend into the heart you know and Christmas not different from the name and Christian is not different from Bob the time you know it's all the same substance its Krishna
 so the more that you know that that energy to sending a different ways it's sending in the form of sugar and Bob was home when we read it it enters the heart and gives us something it gives us that
spiritual transcendental connection whereby We Can chant from the heart rather than just a list buy hearing from Bogota
 by as we're reading you know God one to know about them are teaching them the other day you know being in the temple and with your eyes taking in that the vision of that form you know that's powerful being in the Holy Dom you know being in these holy places something goes into the heart and that's what you're going to chant from that's what's good at that's you know that's what's going to come up you know it's descending from the spiritual world is airing the heart
 if we can if we can just get a little bit they're just a little bit will start to taste something special then we'll begin a relish it it would end it may seem like it's got no flavor is the opposite right what is it bug of agita right that's what which is it seems like natural beginning with a poison in the end
write this material existence then he's like oh God this is just like not gum doesn't only get like I lose the flavor but I start to get harder, you know it's a shoe your mouth is still true in a way but but but said the other the flip side is a spiritualist in the beginning it's it doesn't seem like nectar it all but then it starts to get to Hearn and connector the more that you actually connect with it you know that's what the spiritual practices will become their the sitting in the chanting the witnessing the the the ceremonies in there in the temples of picking up the book and reading from it used to bore me
 now isn't that now it seems like it's it's the my fascination with it and the satisfaction I get the benefit I get just keep growing I like it more now that I'm older I like that's the Pooh
right there
 you want to read something from the commentary text 30 commentary
 in this verse the words metier not Krishna reported devotional service rendered to Krishna so called politicians erudite Scholars and philosophers who read Bhagavad Gita with some meaning from it to suit their material purposes were there misunderstanding misunderstandings of Krishna will not yield them any profit because such politicians philosophers and Scholars are interested in using the bug of agita as a vehicle for adjusting things materially for them constant thought of Krishna Aur Krishna Consciousness is impossible to tear down the mine will not be attracted to my will not like I have that magnetic connection it won't be absorbed in it
 I stayed in the back of the car
1855 is big one might be John Arty only through bhakti devotional service can one understand Krishna it's not a great for everyone so easy to learn that line your mama John a Devotion to me can one understand Krishna as he is the so called politicians and Scholars think of Krishna as fictitious sometimes you see they write this all you do Christmas the politician says that his Krishna is different from Krishna to pick it in the bug of agita she talking to who he's talking about you
 who nehru
 no I I believe that he's talking about dr. radhakrishnan who did that bug of agita commentary where when he came to text 934 where I mean not only that but probably used to talk about particular that comment or that you wrote which it's a verse where I think five or six time Christmas uses a used says me right
sure my woman above my butt always think of me because my devoted you no excetera excetera excetera that the best you will come to me he says here this me hear the song about this that doesn't mean Krishna it means the dark unknown within going to say Rahul Gandhi did he hit you had a famous quote recently it was like all you guys just named all day long as we are with the devil Gandhi chanted at his last year he's not going to win was so called politicians cars think as fictitious he's not
 the politician says that his Krishna is dip
from the Christian depicted in the Gita even though he accept Christian drama since you pay him as a supreme he thinks of Rama and Krista is in personal because he has no idea of service to Krishna the ice is only business is Luna's Patronus charm charm and that means chewing the chewed again and again your world with their bodily senses therefore it's clearly stated here but those who are griha Beretta whose only aim is to live comfortably within the body in the material world cannot understand Krishna taken a vow
 I'm just being soft agree High you know like the home really about to and try to enjoy sure you know the material home I spell usurp
 or the excitement your body
 free how to get them
a person tries to enjoy the sense of gratification in different bodily forms Life After Life but is still unsatisfied
 it's really true and the name of personal ISM this ISM or that ISM such persons always remain attached to materialistic way of life as stated in the Gita great verse to know bogus very appreciated and I appreciate the son you have a Seahawk make a booty Samad home now but he had to send some joint and material opulence and who are bewildered by such things the Resolute determination for bhakti to the Supreme Lord does not take place next to this verse that that said matina Krishna right it does not arise in your mind is that that connection that taste that I owe this thing has more flavor that always in
this is an increase is increases until we get the material drive to start to let go the material drive you don't realize that there red flags for us Boga and Aishwarya the bogus how can I enjoy a nice Ferrari is like oh look at that it's the elite level this type of opulence will make me happy I've been at this lower tier level that Elite Platinum level
 is all a new the latest truck with all of the fancy things on rocks
 it's one thing to be attracted by things but it's another thing to be bewildered by them you know you might say I would like to do that I'd like to have that status for that level that platinum or that you know a high-end package if you actually think no that's actually going to Satisfy My Soul you're off that you left over at
please go up it won't fulfill what you actually want
 I feel something but it will become like chewing that which is being chewed you won't even notice it after a while right there certain people who already have what you have
 there's certain people who want what you already have and they think if I could just be like you
 are you already having it's not a big deal there certain people whatever you think your house is you think I live in okay house there's certain people who be like oh my God if I could only live in you know Jeff eisenberg's house name of Charles Wilson has Kylie's house and you already have anything how can I like expand
 they did kill themselves they can't even imagine having the luxury to have a computer the luxury to be sitting back on the couch the luxury to be you know whatever luxuries we have we have a car and a motorcycle or a car or we have a car that work we have a vehicle we have so much already
no flavor left
 take it for granted
 you know Rugged Cross
 what you just said reminds me of the wisdom that came from our old friend
 Francois de la orokin folk called
 it's not my friend he is like him him a long time ago
 Francois Martin help Francois De La Roca Saturday maybe we should unmute her but he said they're going to like this and I think you're going to find that he was more than just a great head of hair okay
 he said
for we set our hearts too much upon anything let us examine how happy they are who already possess it
 yeah yeah how are they doing they've already reached that they've already reached that particular brand or flavor of success where they at now have had been hit some type of when I was young I always felt like the real successful people are like Saints or sages are Mystics that's what I I feel like these guys are more successful because they're happy with nothing but I mean that to me I was like you don't need anything these guys have figure it out without Donna something yeah yeah they're on to something
 do we need lots of people who have stuff that are just go to like miserable commit suicide neurotic psychotic you know it's not a material metric it's got to be something else how can you be happy with
what is ask yourself how can I be happy with nothing to think of
 the violation of Asado right at the renowned spoke to Yogi who's what they have
 is this name right this like you saw so many of you have written like this you know the six go Swami's I was here in a wonderful lecture on giva goswami
 erotic remind people who we've had on the show before the professor Wright Oxford grab pH is there's a whole series of send me these animals attacking links send me that one I sent you I sent these he's got a whole series it's got a couch several series
I want to get Exempted maybe put on the board of the next time I talk OK Google he was describing hoochie with us while he was as you go Swami was the nephew the group and Sonata just because you're saying that I can concentrate on us but he said he began to say that Rupa and Sanaa Lathan worth of practically the very highest levels of the governments of the area that we now call gbenga and that means Bangladesh and West Bengal which was the most prosperous and you know wealthy of all the the different areas that we now call India
 and so there is the Muslim ruler I believe he was called the knob like an hour it's like a governor or something yeah
he was like a governor and they say Robinson and we're like number 3 and 4
 you know if two novels number one he had his number to Andrew Prince not for like three and four yeah they say that number two
 is actually never really trusted because that's the person shooting for the number one position so they trusted these guys they trusted these great Saints vs. They're much more better phone number to that makes sense there's no way they were going to let the Hindus take over that position
 yeah that would never happen in your number two guys the one that shooting for two you're not actually revealing that means if I died that person becomes but you're not revealing to him your weaknesses or you know you're not you're not opening up and give me that person too much power and so he basically said Rupa was like basically like a prime minister like he was the one
and and Dustin was like like the person I was ahead of the refinance I go all the economy and then all that and so this is the kind of family that Jiva goswami was growing up and you know yeah he was he was incredibly well educated and just incredibly brilliant you know and these are the people that left it all behind
 put on basically Rags you know like you need to take a piece of cloth to wrap it around your waist and that's it I'm going to ship for my bunk rags to these really are already wearing nothing but their Rags when they put a riser just like I'm not at all concerned with
 looking special in any way just give me that piece of cloth in a wrapped around my waist and I'm ready to go and they were sleeping under different tree every night
the treasures that they had in the roles in the government
 were like you know palaces and you don't credible material opulence because they let it all go because none of that had any flavor so I did have flavor what they considered the greatest treasure was this name just the name Krishna that's a group of Swami he wrote his first right but is it going to start
 what's the time in mind right now but the name the name is very good but I think about I give you the English is that
 when I get a holding it when the Holy Name is dancing at my tongue then I wish I had thousands and thousands of tongues
millions of tongues it's like I just can't taste it enough it's so sweet I just when I when the when it enters when the Holy Name Krista enters into my ears I wish I had that thousands of years
 and when the Holy Name enters into the courtyard of the heart
 conquers my senses right and conquers the heart and my senses become a nerd like you goes into deep spiritual trans relishing tasting the super Bubblicious flavor that never ends I do not know how much nectar it doesn't run out of nectar it just keeps producing more natural I do not know how much gum that never ends and never hint I do not know how much nectar the two syllables Krishna have produced a troop of the Swami he's got nothing except he had so much
external opulence he walked away from it this is the point this is the point you and I became monks we give up anything we had nothing is like okay you can take it home with you think we're going to go from being like to like homeless monk guys with me like you know what I'm over all that I got that's a huge bit that's a big that's a that's a big step you know they had so much and they gave it up and of course there's that famous story about Saint Anthony goswami where
 it was rumored that he had this mad. Evil titled on your kind of this kind of mystical stone that can transform metal into gold and people heard about this in one person came and had the had the audacity to just ask for it did you give me that
and it's not what song is this just sitting here chatting his job but it's like you know what's over there
 and it's like really I just take them if you want to it was lying there in like a garbage heap you have any stone in and then he's walking away and then in the actor Wyle because he thinks that he gave up this Stone so easily he's got something better he's got something better over there she goes back and he says you know I was thinking to myself that if you could have persons I really belong to have something better for you to give this up to have a line in the garbage you just let me walk away with it what have you got so special and snuggle sources of what I could tell you I can give it to you
 but first you have to do you got to throw that stone away take that touchdown and throw it away now that's it that's way up that stone into the yamuna river that's like one of those
get like or are you going to go for you know if you just won $50 but you want to go for a hundred a hundred and so that was okay so what is it
 but my dad is the treasure that there are things in this world do not the external things but it is deeply sorry things on a whole nother level the name of Christian of the srimad bhagavatam the beautiful transition form of Christ of the Holy Dom Christian Association of great up to Yogi's these things externally they have no value but they have tremendous spiritual value that will never get dry and tasteless rather the more you chew it
the more juice that's there than the sweeter it gets returned a $10 Lira to a tenant that's the verse in Dayton. Believe it's a 78 and Dively love the value from Harrisburg testbig anything to take away today got a lot of interesting things said today yeah I never see you right you're always just need it whenever look to the right you're knitting
 don't get too busy for her
yeah it's a little scarves that stuff don't get too busy doing nothing
 go get busy doing nothing figure out success before you climb the ladder cuz you might end up going up the wrong wall
 wise up and realize externals won't make us happy
 spiritual life is ever fresh she gets more flavorful Everfresh
 your new car is chewing the chewed until the senses are controlled there's no satisfaction I know you got to realize you got to realize that you got to be a little more careful
sweet thing Gobstopper I think it's better than this great again I had like the ever the score, never ends cinnamon come on
 how can we be happy with nothing
 I have a question honey my question was am I chewing the chewed right now remember that one ever went out there think about that today is you're doing your stuff and it gets more Bubblicious as you go
 oh everybody think so look there's a new Amendment road rage has a new world spin this one actually and Eli Musk
