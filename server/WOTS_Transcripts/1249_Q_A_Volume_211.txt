 cold cuts cold cuts on the bank of the river Ganga
 we actually walked to the temple today and we went for a walk to the temple was really nice we had has many fond memories of stay
when I was young man I talked about in my book a lot got some unsavory unsavory memories as well that's fine but yes how are you
 another day for Q&A if you're listening welcome if you're new to this on Facebook welcome my audiobook is out and I'm bought tears when I'm feeling with the audio book did someone just press a thumbs-down or was that me okay my audiobook is out it's sort of top-secret wasn't supposed to release this out and me and Mary walking around the city's listening to it and I'm thinking this is a very good introduction even though it's my life story it's a great introduction book integration account
and it's not told from a very Ricci way to sort of might like my experience so far so I urge everybody to get it but I have a order or do I order you know I hate I think it's a good that you should get one if you already ordered one order one for friends can would prefer that you think you know what I think you're going to like this are you going to amazon.com just get two of them instead of one of them 300 head and go forth Rory's book the distributor and you don't have to say like I want you to become a Merry Christmas my friend wrote this book I think you'd like it you know something like that
 I really find this a gripping tale of spiritual Adventure but unlike radna Swami's book journey home it's my journey home but you know I'm not Swami's like that and then I slept under a tree
for 30 days and fasted for 60 days and through all my clothes in a river mine was sort of like my struggles going to India and second-guessing myself and struggle controlling my senses tuna since it's sort of like a different maybe people could relate to it who have similar issues as me sounds good but if you do get the audio books to it's it's very funny cuz I I take on different voices
 matter fact by tomorrow I'll be taking on me wrong ways did you do not wrong did you do me wrong I do you wrong though I did you push my way out of a paper bag
 no I probably did some sophisticated voice for you

 Hari Bhajan.
 The stupa
okay
 so first question was Sheba is from your friend of mine Neil
 other than all this deal for Memphis Neil okay
 I am in a dotted person and for many years 20 plus I have wrestled with strong desire to connect with my birth mother several years back through the appropriate videos back to the appropriate state agency I was able to learn her identity and even some details surrounding my birth however no connection was ever made because she chose the contact Vito option once it once informed of my interest in such out probably hurt
 this was her legally
heading right I have to abide in a bye-bye and respect as you can imagine it was beyond disappointment to me and I was left really struggling to understand why things played out this way until that point I little more than a curiosity about who my birth family was but because of this of the insistence of a mentor I began taking steps to gather info I began to feel that I was supposed to do this and started projecting an outcome much more like a reunions on Oprah then the hard door slam in the face after learning more about reincarnation and Karma and probably more confused by this experience because there seems to be a natural desire to make this connection
 I wish I could find someone else in the boxing community that has had a similar Spirits I doubt a non adopted person can truly relate to this type of longing I'm obviously supposed to
learn from the situation and perhaps take some action but I am now 60 and my birth mother is 80 so time is an issue this situation may be more than what could be addressed on a wismec sages Q&A but if you could offer any wisdom that might provide me a better understanding or a little piece on this topic topic I will be even more in your debt kind of guards Neil from Memphis what they was on the show today
 I would go into all-out private eye mode Neil wouldn't you consume no not at all I would be like in a car parked in front of the Bell come on I'd have like photographs set up a camera crew rent the house across from hers take photos knock on the door pretend you're selling something I
 what would you do
 am I won't do any of that
, is it
Neil said he won't don't what you want build understand maybe don't understand that that the burning desire
 yeah when you said it was interesting when you said
 set on you called it what did you call it
 as you can imagine
 none of it is lost now
 I doubt an adopted person can truly relate to this type of longing longing that may be a fax but
 everybody's longing Neil experience some something that I don't
you know about what it's like to find out that you've been adopted that your mother
 that you weren't raised by your mother
 and you know that Mother's Love is Like You don't have Foundation upon which the child's emotional stability and their psychological development
 you don't talk built on that right from the beginning even before you're born and so that connection
 it's it may be the realest thing that we kind of feel like we said the foundation you know
 when I heard this question when it made me think
 was that
 no course Neil is talk about this in relation to bhakti and say I wish I knew someone in a practice is about to that really understood exactly what I was going through
but they are tears in bhakti
 this is
 a bit of a paradox right there in the body in the yoga culture in general
 there's a whole social background to it it's not the essence of the body practice but it's supported of the body practice that we want a stable environment and therefore things like the dorm of motherhood in the dorm of fatherhood are our glorified the responsibility that one has when they take that role is seen as very important because it's from that support from that love that the child has a kind of a balanced emotional life right they feel sick when one feels that security and that love
 if it gives him a peaceful mind
and it said peaceful mind that is in one sense is going to be easy you know that that piece for my hand in this is something you and I discussed a lot right now. It's like the peaceful mind isn't the goal but the peaceful mind is a fertile ground in which one can approach the ball which shirt for the Bucs Yogi's Christian Prema that's what we're aiming for the love of Krishna so that's the bility that emotional stability that's what you know that's what you kind of vest a longing right but really that longing
 that longing for what you feel like you missed out on
 it's really just a displaced longing for the real mother the real father you know Krishna Maha Krishna Pizza it's like
 that there is is that the longing that everyone has
 and that's what we're missing and even if you had even if you met your mother
 right
now it could even be worse it's like what am I done why did I open up this can of worms
 the woman could be totally dipped in shame also look at my guess is when you're 80 years old and this is coming at you right now it's like I'm ready to leave I'm ready to go I'm not ready to start my whole life again and go backwards 60 years I could imagine be very difficult for a woman to do that right you know you're you're you're preparing to leave this world and then you get drawn into the deepest most heavy emotional
 part of your life and you got to go 60 years back and energy saying with probably likely different types of feeling maybe feelings of regret maybe feelings of Shame humiliation I mean it could be very very difficult thing to ask of one but you see here's the thing
if we look at how the yoga culture has designed its own one hand is designed to give that stability the stability of a of a stable home environment of a stable loving home environment but is also designed in a way that towards the end of life you let go of it all and asked you you enter the unstable right because you know if you become too comfortable in that warm home in those warm relationships you never get down to the what can be the cold Stark reality
 that in this material world there is only one shelter and when you really reach out when when you feel that deep and you reach out teeth in the warmth and the connection that you're looking for in this person you find that person actually couldn't really delivered any way but I can find it in my connection with God in my heart or medical I reach for that
right and so therefore instability is built into that you wander off at the end of life and search for God in the heart you know there is a beautiful there's a beauty in the goodness of the news story in the same way if the person has a spouse that left them or broke their hearts or betrayed them or a child that went astray or died or a spouse that died because
 when there's a break in which seems should be like Mysterio really solid when there's a break it's such an obvious at least through our lens
 it's an obvious
 reality check that get it you thought this was eternal love you thought this was an eternal friendship that you thought this was an eternal Bond just see the material world there's no eternality here everything is temporary so when something happens which is a unnatural break
it's actually a blessing it's giving you a foreshadows reality we're as real intimacy when it's really good in the material world incredibly loving sweet relationships a loving family those bonds are very deep in their very difficult to break especially at the time of death when we just want Krishna we have to just be focused on Krishna so that deep attachment that you might have if she was the mother that really showed up it wouldn't be able sometimes those those good buns are not a blessing as Taro would say when it's good it's bad so that is saying that it could be a very big blessing and I would immediately Shake It Off I was joking earlier about become the private I shake it off
much easier you know yeah that's it much easier why are we trying to rekindle the attachments that has never been there
 right yeah we we have to try to
 take any whatever our circumstances we have to try to use it as an advantage in our spiritual life so if we get emotional and you know the stability and let's use that as an advantage and if we get instability that we have to use that as an advantage and and so yeah I like that it's so it's so here's you know there's a yearning in your there's a longing in you kneel now you can feel that longing that that longing it can either be a total distraction
 or it can be turning and write an exact Direction it needs to go
and that long and can become your most that longing can become the deepest spiritual connections you have
 if it's if it's misdirected because it becomes the biggest distraction and if it is properly directed it's it's your momentum to take you towards connecting unit to the feet of Christian hero connecting you ultimately to Chris diprima so yeah I think I think you know it in one sense sure it's easy for me to say I'm not in your situation but it would seem to me like I'll take that long and say Krishna you've I don't know why you know what I've done previous lives that made me you know that that that that
 that brought me into this world in this way where I didn't have a direct connection to my to my
birth mother
 and even 60 years into my life I felt a longing for that deep in me a call in for that
 but I know that that what I'm really need the shelter that I'm really looking for the love that I'm really looking for is in you so please let that longing in me
 connect me with you
 you know that that's turn it to take take what's a disadvantage or distraction turn it into an advantage and let the momentum of that let the power that you know we don't have to Snuff out our emotions we just had to get him well directed you know in bhakti
 I didn't answer a good question to The Message Board Narayan he was also adopted yeah she said she'd her experience was different yeah I'm sure that we're all different and we are going to react to a different way some people like I've got to find them no matter
I do you're not my real mother in O stuff like that are crazy it's not really a Christian Miracle but it's just a cool Christmas Story
 okay if I share can I share one with you at least share if you remember this really nice lady who doesn't live that far from me call Nikki Haas I remember the last time I saw Nikki there the last time was with her was the night of the the flower festival and I remember she had to lie she tended the floor first and then she had to leave like right after I remember the tears in her eyes when she left and I'll never forget that moment in my heart forever it from that moment she's such a special lady and we're doing Retreat together at the farm this year in September but I was on the phone with her and she was just like you know I've got such a crazy story I was a go with your story she goes well you know I did your 3:00 in d.c.
she's always talking about Krishna bhakti about this and not and you don't and you don't it's been about 3 years or maybe four years and it's raining she did and I haven't really hung out with it that much
 Sprite long like 6 years 6 years perhaps
 but you know I'm talking to her like we've been hanging out yesterday and she's just like so grateful for the 300 hour training I got so much out of that it meant so much to it changed everything I said yeah I like how did you get into that did she goes I signed up for it thinking that the bhakti yoga cultural immersion I thought that was the name of your school I have no idea what I was into it first as soon as I got there I was like wait a second what's going on she didn't understand anything about where she was what she was doing and she said it was the greatest mistake I ever made that was her quote the most beautiful greatest
did the guy ever made cuz I fell in love with Krishna after that training when she was crying having to just you know to leave and then get on a taxi and go straight to the airport but her crying the tears that she was shedding
 I knew that those are genuine tears of like separation from Christmas devotees and and gratitude gratitude for all that she had experienced and I never forgot that and in like I say it she worked her way right into my heart and then I'll never forget her great memory Lord Texas 2018 some people are so right when you just hit them with some trash mental knowledge of their like that makes 100% chance it 100% sense since I've been waiting to hear this and some people I got like struggle with it for a year
two years five years ten years or maybe it just will never make sense but some people are just like so right to hear transcendental sound as such interesting, when you meet somebody like that
 how do you depreciate that you got a good memory to my friend I remember Nikki is an animus this is Ryan. I miss other
 I haven't seen it so if you want to write a anonymously you can do that as well
 and even if like we know your name cuz maybe the email or something unless you're not going to blow your cover okay hi this is anonymous other I have been having problems with ADHD most of my life my Dino attention deficit
I got distracted what who are you I thought it was just her most of my life and I know the consensus on what ADHD is or if it is is unclear and there's a spectrum so I'm going to say that for me it means not remembering things I do not be able to organize myself even though I tried many systems and they worked for a while but only maximum for two weeks I squirrel out of control and conversations regularly without realizing it through time is precious coming from are you the anonymous writer a geology me and Gigi really sympathize with you cuz we're the two most ADHD people that we know a squirrel out of your age group of ADHD
don't forget to go there who don't forget to show up yesterday
 I swear a lot of control and conversations regularly without even realizing it through time and practice it did get better though but yeah you guessed it I digress a lot even writing this email with some folks to keep the topic at Bay is kind of exhausting and that's the tip of the iceberg let me tell you mood swings are a thing so are over reactions to some minor incidents and there's even a technical term for this phenomenon and I can't remember the name a chatter remind forgetting things I set out to do to distractions it seems like normal stuff when I write it down but people need to understand this is not sometimes happens kind of thing this is a most of the times burden for me and my surroundings especially when the overwhelmed kicks in and I can't do anything
it takes all my willpower to do the simplest things it gets really hard and even our good times and it's been affecting my ability to do sod enough in any shape or form I can do 16 rounds per month and it's amazing but then I drop down to one at Best and I take months to get back up to 22 more than four before I knew it ADHD I kind of beat my before I knew it was ADHD a kind of beat up myself about it and at least I know what it is now so I've been reading for sure the proper punch books and on and on and off for some six years now and I've been listening to the podcast to my question is okay brain is legitimately Brooklyn some wreck wreck I can make some reparations with a corresponding lifestyle to help mitigate some or most of my issues
 but is that not the box of Yogi way
should I just let it go and let God or should I try to make myself a better instrument for God we're fine I know she would probably prioritize hell so we can serve better is this fall into that category
 do I work on my body to heal or do I just surrender to God God's plan I'm in a good place now but sometimes it just gets tough feels hard seeing yourself as you as you constantly disappoint everyone around you and you really can't help it most of the times sometimes it just takes over sorry much appreciation to love everyone trying to heal the world all the best in the New Year Anonymous via email so still talking about their ADHD it right yes that's that's the baby yeah well I can say I am a card-carrying member of the ADHD Club I'll do things like start cleaning a bedroom find a shoe bring it to the shoe room start
I want me to share room I find a hat bring that over in the Hat Box look for look for a hat box that's got me looking through the garage for box need to go out and buy a hat I got to clean I'm serious man cleaning one thing I'm cleaning six things and none of it gets done it's exhausting it's exhausting and social media doesn't help scrolling doesn't help but I will say that
 chanting japa is so good for my mind it's actually a super duper plastic blessing because especially sitting and chanting because you're forced not to do anything but sit I'll try sitting standing sitting standing walking around 2 but then I got to be like no time to sit down time to sit down I think for the 8th day I don't think walking and chanting helps me either I think it's good for me and Minds like mine and chant
Jiva art my my cohort and ADHD
 I got it by the way I got a text message from Mike Judge today looking at the Mike from the band judge he looked at a picture of the Box recovery podcast two guys isn't it she's a Christian
 so anyway but anyway so jeep has got a bad she do what she does for chanting japa she plays a lecture ever hear those Joppa cuz that's a problem section under the Swami Radha soami just chanting japa and that helps her hold her mind but for me it's just like sitting in a place and chanting so I think Krishna bhakti is especially good for holding the Mind mantras are good to hold the mind to steal the mind to control the minds that's what we have to do and what will happen is The Munsters make them
peaceful you know they make the Mind steady to make the mine sober
 anything but that kazoo
 you know that the question reminds me a little bit of the previous question it's it's similar it has to do with
 you know my mind is not peaceful because I'm yearning for a mother's love you no recognition my mind is not peaceful because I have 80 HD
 there's so many different circumstances in this world which give us a disturbed mind is a matter of fact isn't it the very beginning of human bog, mentions does it not that in this age what is a month to someone and my Tio my mind is always Disturbed that there's so many problems with this age and we all have so many issues were dented in so many ways and above all
 our minds are always Disturbed and so you have a condition I don't really know what ADHD is
exactly what causes it you know do you know how does it manifest you know is it in the brain synapses or something like that that I don't leave me alone for probably over stimulus I don't know what and then we can ask her bait it with what the symptoms as you're explaining them I recognize them and so you questions are good questions I don't think we have exact answers for those questions because I think those are questions that need to be dealt with on an individual basis like if I'm 80 years old and I have ADHD it's one thing if I'm 15 years old and might be another thing you know like depending on
 what what opportunity there is two
 to improve it for instance right the question seemed to kind of be getting at should I just accept it
 and work with it should I fight it so that you know I'll have a better instrument
you know to engage in bhakti I think either one of those can be a valid approach you know it's it's it's something that you know you can talk with with your doctor or whatever experts know about this and determine you know if you can if you can overcome it and someone you don't prove it and sell my that's a good thing course it's going to make it easier for you to concentrate is going to make it easier for you to read in some but again if it's going to be a disadvantage that you have to live with
 and take that disadvantage and turn it into an advantage you know of find find out cuz I shared with you on the show that I I don't know if I have some kind of clinical you know what I'm
 case of something like eighty you do more than previously my life I have a difficult time.
one thing for a long time and so you know I kind of didn't yes so like for instance if I'm starting a commonly will study something for like 20 minutes or half an hour at a time and then switch to another subject do you know like if I want to study for for like an hour and a half or two hours sometimes I find I need to kind of flip it you noted to keep the Mind engage which is distressing to me that that I'm that weak but you do what you have to do if someone's calling that a Pomodoro Technique you take lots of breaks that you can set a timer so so you know I don't know the answer to to tour questionnaires question you know
 it did the here here's what they wrote
 hey bro. OK my brain is legitimately wrecked in some way I can make some reparations with a corresponding lifestyle to help mitigate summer most my issues but is that not the bus Tioga way
can totally be the body of the way you feel is effective and in your responding to it and it's making it easier for you to remember Krishna easier for you to absorb your mind and Krishna then then great then then they went on to say should I just let Let It Go and just let it go let go and let God or should I try to make myself a better instrument for God where is the line you have to figure out where that line is I can't figure out that line but the principal you want to keep in mind is that some that we discover this yesterday right somehow or other
 whether it's constantly watching 10-minute clips about Krishna is reading you know different books 5 minutes each whatever you know Channing one round and then we run around the block and coming down Channing another whatever it is somehow or other you find a way that helps you bring your mind to Krishna in a favorable mood and ends in whatever this this is
images try to somehow use turn it into an advantage work with it you know it might that might mean improving it it might mean living with it either way is the body of a way that was a question but is that not the bucket Yogi way the Bucks you owe you way is we adapt whatever we have to do so that we can remember Krishna in a favor. That's about the only way
 yeah you know I went through. Where I started to try to medicate my ADHD cuz I was told it was interfering with my life but you know what I didn't like the feeling of being medicated I feel like it it it it it crushed something it was a positive about my ADHD also there's something good about it something creative about it that to Medicated down the part of my gift
to the my gift to bring squirrels into the water left me and I wouldn't want to go on a boring old roggio that's very very functional you know
 okay the world is always trying to like give us a label and tell us what we have diagnosis give it a name so they can sell us a drug for it and then into it
 okay next question
 yes sir
 is it from this is from
 are you awake
Oceanside California
 I believe in being very open with my five-year-old daughter and as my grandma 99 years old 100 in June we have had conversations about death explained reincarnation for her and she kind of likes the idea of it she finds it comforting that were connected in future and past lives however maybe it's too early to introduce the concept to her she's really struggling I want you to be my mama in my next life we found a dead rabbit in our driveway this morning and she was really sad but said it won't have a next life because it's a rabbit I tried to explain that all beings have next lives but she's confused should I not bring this up anymore or do you have better way to explain this to my daughter who is kind of wild but really loves offering shell
flowers to Krishna I recently did research on children's understanding of death for work and it seems children her age supposedly can't really comprehend death spell maybe I made a big mistake offering deeper details I appreciate any insight
 you know I think cuz tuba I'm no child psychiatrist I'll do people sometimes tell me that I am laughing you know when you hear these like gory Grimms Brothers stories who is Corey story and then they put the witch in the stove is sort of like when you hear those stories it's just like when we read the the child reads the Rami on the comic books and comprehend the death in the same way we comprehend that's what I understood so they don't understand all the
nuances are intricacies of what death actually is but I think they can understand the basics the rabbits not here anymore I think it should be explained I like the idea that telling a child spear isn't everything and everything is eternal and it just changes form and you could have been my child you could have been my parent in a previous life but in this life I'm your daddy or your mama
 I think it's I think it's okay and I understand it and I don't think they're completely blacked out to the idea of death it's just they just might miss the door Inus of it and their own concepts of where Grandma went to such a great grandma went
 you know I was thinking that you know you have a lot more experience in this room than I do so how did that work with your own kids
 I taught him the bag of agita
 the time sloping from the Bhagavad Gita
 from an early age
come like that 45
 they didn't seem to
 you know maybe maybe cherries kids are just there are kid is just dumb
 maybe she has a little bump that you're going through a hard time putting it all together but it's just something that it'll be good for them in the long run that they did hear about it they say is I don't know I'm really turned into as you for experience on this one well I took what we have in a we live in a farm so my daughter was always rescuing baby squirrel baby bunnies she's had like three or four pets that died in her hands the Wonder Pets they were just rescued they were like I beat him from a cat or something like that to Pigeon should a baby bunny and she brought the bunny you like right to the altar this is more than one occasion brought the dying animal right to the Altar and watch the Animal League
died and we have to have the talks about that has to listen to the best way for this animal to die is dying right in front of Krishna but why did it have to die well everything's going to die and it was rabid I think it's sort of a good time to do it at this time of life went to take away the mystery of it we really we really hi-def until there's like a drastic tragedy but I was telling you the other day me and we were going to Rickshaw coming back from some festive event in my poor and we are in the back of my cycling this little rinky-dink pickup truck and they're having a big kirtan and who is with us but they're like I did that's they're having a funeral right there
 and it was like two feet sticking out of the back of a pickup truck
 Gina and Katherine wood with us and yeah
Jiva just like screaming enchanting I was like that's their funeral they're having a like a real funeral but was a Festa funeral and you could understand cuz you see the body you see the body burning into the body wrapped up and there's almost like a celebration of life going on right there were very quick to hide stuff sweep things up and then you know tucked away in a morgue morgue Mortuary
 The Lion King in Atticus and talk about it with
 yeah and I knelt during the baby line in town. You know these things
 I'm Broadway Broadway two things I've ever seen in Broadway where the hell you doing on Broadway
even though you had a material life okay with your by yourself now they are give us both times you don't think I have any friends go by yourself to go with you the boss David Ritter brought me to The Lion King
 Larry David Richard used to run a company that when I first came back to New York he had a anyway he's a nice to rodini totally took you to The Lion King
 remember I don't even remember was there either I know there's a cartoon where the the animals are talking like that but yeah it seems like I'm the wrong person to talk about him if he's going to but it seems to me like when the kids start to inquire
best time to start to share it but it just has to be shared in a way that's inside justable as possible from simple enough to share this before but my big parenting went one of my bigger parenting Wings in my life was I was teaching my kids bhagavad-gita I think you might even know this they had shlokas under their belt and my ex-wife brought the kids back from the movie and the older one who is 9 was crying his eyes out and I still what's the matter he said well
 took him to this movie and in the little boy died in the movie it was really upsetting I can't believe it was a children's movie and the younger stepson grabbed me by the arm and said you know I wasn't really upset and then he quoted did he spend your time that he come around yet which is 213 for the back of a d as in Body Soul and they said in English but I wasn't really worried when he died as he lived
so continuously passes misleh life from childhood do you throw old age the soul similarly enters a new body at the time of death was wisest not bewildered by such a change so I wasn't worried when he died it's one of those things you Lodge one of these little wisdom nuggets in your head and then when you least expect it and you need it it just manifest until it's another big part of like studying
 Gita or sacred literature to give us intelligence and intent what intelligence supplied then it becomes wisdom than you then you then you get it and it helps you cope with the pain of existence bothering when
 the following fathering fails to hold us for later
is from Brinkley Tomo name frankly frankly frankly this is Telmo hear Frank mare is it frankly Tomo or is it Frank of this when it come from are you know where I pick this up I pick this up
 on Facebook someone wrote this question in on yesterday's show it's okay if we are building our lives for the few now for the future how is it best to process the elements of Our Lives now that we may feel cursed to have
 what we're building our lives now for the future how is it best to process the elements of Our Lives now
 that we do you kill cursed to have in other words if if if our goal is to improve ourselves so they were functioning better in the future which I would say is consistent with
to practice and there's certain elements in our lives right now that may feel like their curses
 how do you process them
 so that's you keep moving towards that brighter future
 like we said earlier that the curse is in bhakti often times for the blessings our shortcomings are my desire for fame and I didn't get it and I desire for beauty and protracting people it's a happening I desire to get money it's not working all these things are material curses but when when embraced they all become blessings they actually all I get it I could, I would have been such a diversion Fame Beauty well there they can they can be such Divergence from experts or path
 so that's
 what do you think do you think that hits his head on the head there so I do I think that dumb the way
about the yogi sees the world you know there's within there's two you could say I sent you those two ways to see the world right that everything is random
 where did everything has meaning and and so the body always the faith is that everything has meaning that everything that happens in our life is Meaningful and if you can understand something about that meeting then everything becomes a stimulus for your potential stimulus program with
 bright and so if that's the case
 then is the debauchery of you say Okay behind whatever is coming my direction this world I actually have the faith that this world is moving in such a way
 that is always favorable

The stimulus for a reconsideration to consider eight the the stimulus for breaking out of the mud that we're stuck in you know it's those curses in life and it again we've been talkin about him today and maybe my ADHD and maybe the fact that I was born you know without the connection to my birth mother you know it may be in that I have an inner turn longing for that that that is present here sixty years later my life it may be
 so many things
that do you know I believe that all most most essentially what we call wisdom has so much to do with this exactly this that rather than lamenting rather than complaining rather than working like an idiot to try to ship things that I'm incapable of Shifting or I shipped it and then something else shifts and I'm right back where I was wisdom means I can accept it and grow through it learn from it and go through it and so if there are aspects in our lives that seem like feel like look like their curses
 the wise person has a way of seeing them as a blessing and why should the wise person has has a way of seeing like this is this is what I need and you know that process

collie that one feels in life you know like he can feel like a deep Melancholy that's like really healthy and yes it is it it's like a deep sadness like okay I'm not going to and if you weren't a devotee it's hard to really applaud apply it to buy being a devoted you can really apply it and it can stir in your heart and you can see some light in there too otherwise I'm at your world seems like it's not fair I tried so hard I didn't get what I wanted I can't believe her or him otherwise it's your world is filled with lots of bitterness a lot of a lot of like that's not fair how dare they are why me that is a big one of the material world these are the mantras of the materialist but sitting with loss with betrayal

 and then you could see that that that your child became disappoint that that person left your child
 and it sent her child into a deep kind of melancholy about it you know if there was there was there the pain of loss
 but as a parent you might even feel like this is exactly the medicine that the child need you know we're trying to help them understand what the issue was they weren't able to see it now they're seeing it themselves and their experiences
experience is going deep right it's going deep into the into the blood into the bones into the marrow you know so that the child's learning something that that'll be valuable in Samuel never forget some of that all
 help them grow and I think these things in life those curses in life you know that that you said they have to do with relationships you know your circumstances around our relationships they seem like horses but that melancholy
 that may be the most potent medicine you know if you don't wallow in it but you expect you go through it you feel it but as you're going through it you're reflecting on truth that becomes a really potent medicine the stormy seas make better Sailors you and your nautical
