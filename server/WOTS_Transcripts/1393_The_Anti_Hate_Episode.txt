 someone just told me how frogs come from China try to go with me and they're just like they can't go to Chinese can't get the pieces to India anyway how are you doing all right I am I from James Baldwin James Baldwin
 what can you tell me about James Baldwin well sometimes they call Jimmy I don't think they did actually it was an American writer and civil rights activist who garnered Acclaim for his essays
novels plays and poems
 and it's not 253 novel Go Tell It on the Mountain has been ranked by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 english-language novels really know nothing about him video video I mean I knew about that much I've never been okay I was pretty impressive okay so here's our hatred which could destroy so much never failed to destroy the man who hated
 and this was an immutable law I'm going to read that again cuz it's important hatred which could destroy so much never fail to destroy the man who hated and this was an immutable law
 immutable immutable unchangeable right let me double mirror overtime or unable to be changed yeah I
personally had to pull back from watching any and people can criticize you know I want but I know my mind and I think my month our minds are like very precious and what comes in a position of influence where we can
 our actions our thoughts are the words that come out of my mouth have a ripple effect that I had to pull back just from news it's become so hateful I walk away from it is becoming angry tell me how you feel broken up in your body what is that experience like for you it's like shutting down it's sort of like the first of all it's it's not finding a commonality it's like searching for what's wrong has it want to hear how I've been destroyed by it on ya
Bart on the message board agrees with me can't watch it if you can watch it and you could if you can watch it and consume it and do something good with it the once I find that is turning me towards hey I just like it's enough it has to make me feel it just makes me almost like curmudgeon e depressed walk around like like like it makes me feel hopeless like what is his got World getting to this world's been got done some horrible things for generations for Millennia horrible things been happening these the tar and feather people it hurts it hurts all my God cooked and spilled oil on my hand ever do that Mary your Chef you have horrible isn't it imagine tar
 first of all went are cools and hardens
so let me get it off its going to harden on your skin and then on top of that insult to injury right there at the injury doing horrible things like this formula is that a new thing this image with a horrible things forever
 is a cruel cruel world
 I really want to go to skinny people live but they've done that to take back to my question you asked how I feel I feel horrible that I did a little research a little research and I feel even worse right now I mean why not just make the person wear a bird suit for a few days and if he goes yeah you better wear
this is from medicine. Net website written by one medical author named terkini radhakrishnan rohini and a lot of this isn't like the articles based on it I saw a lot of research out there and it didn't get sent to like you know the different areas of the brain that are triggered by feelings of hate and analyzes that kind of thing. This is kind of just like a son why you were asking me how do you feel right going to try to get well we could we could talk about how hate affects the people that you hate and socially the proms and clothes but now we're talkin about like for the individual I like this better be like that ain't what is hating doing to you like what is here's just a little introductory study hate is a feeling of intense hostility in a version usually deriving from Fear
 anger or sense of injury
it is Extreme dislike or disgust hatred is an emotion extreme hatred can Inspire violence hatred is a feeling everyone has felt and experienced at some point especially after being betrayed or hurt physically or emotionally by someone
 it is normal to have hateful feelings occasionally however the only hatred over a long time and I think this is what a lot of us are doing right feeling hatred over a long time
 and holding on to hate
 this is what we do voluntarily right yeah it can be detrimental to the mind and body
 he can breed more negative emotions it can affect personal and professional relationships hatred changes the chemistry in the brain wow it stimulates the area in the brain responsible for planning and execution of motion this part triggers aggression while feeling hateful to either.
and or attack is also creates fight or flight response has and increases the levels of two hormones
 cortisol and adrenaline these hormones could cause weight gain and somnia anxiety depression and chronic illness Americans you know yeah we got a problem with with you know there's a weight problem in this country and we often talk about our diets and definitely are. But maybe this has a lot to do with the two of these twenty-four-hour news cycles and just watching watching these networks like all day which a lot of people do they just actually Criminal
 hatred also triggers the mind to try to predict what the person is being hated made do it as a defense mechanism this leads to further anxiety restlessness obsessive thinking and paranoia which affects over
call mental health hatred negatively impacts the nervous system immune system and endocrine system
 extreme emotions trigger the release of stress hormones in the brain over time the stress hormones lead to increased inflammation throughout the body resulting in significant Health consequences the more intense emotion becomes the more physically demanding it is to contain it holding onto hate can be exhausting and can cause involuntary and voluntary clenching of the jaw yeah yeah that's what it does to me a cleanser the whole base clenches I think you know a lot of us are kind of like stuck there like
 you know two large portions of our day
 and and we can relate and then we're taking pills to
 the kind of try to relax volume clinch the pain you unclench your going online and find different things so that
grinding our teeth down
 Soto James Baldwin is saying that he's a he's trying to say that you know you can destroy so much and it certainly does the one thing and never fail to destroy
 is it a person who's holding that hate within themselves and so from the yoga perspective
 it's the youth the yogis are doing what most people don't do so much they're looking at their own mind they're observing their own mind they're very conscious of the
 how the programming in the mind is playing out in their life experience and with the idea of not identifying with the mind but observing it and then hopefully through Yoga practices readjusting it resetting it reprogramming it in way that's fully positive and Progressive and healthy
and can lead to still much higher levels of accomplishment or you no gain then the material is he even thinks about but just on the very basic level if we've gotten if we are unaware
 of the Carnival of the type of hatred that were voluntarily hanging out to maybe we've been proud of it maybe it makes us feel better than others and so we hang onto hatred it's really a do you know it internally destructive path in this really for the prosperous for us who gather together and read but La pagua Tom every morning like I'll is you don't listen to this podcast
 if we really want to take bhakti to wurthmann to go
 we're going to have to dress it we're going to have to identify we're going to have to see how it's dominating my thoughts distracting my concentration I really want to bring my mind
that I can share a problem my problem I got problems I got problems baby remind me like when I was a raw foodist 20 years ago I was raw foodist and I could do really well as a pretty much like 99% raw food is like about a year-and-a-half and then I did like it off then I went to like a high percentage of bra but I could do purely Rob but it was hard because if you ate anything cooked it was somehow dragged you down a slippery slope and so I think media is like this media is this type of like news media is like mud and if you go in a little to say. I just want to check in with stuff
what I find and I'm not going to say this is an absolute for everybody but I find it is it's a slippery slope and the way YouTube Works in these algorithms works it just drags you deeper and deeper and deeper next thing you know you're sitting in a mud pie like a pig and if you if you sit in mud you're going to get dirty if you sit in while you're going to get dirty it's going to build up the mate clogs up the might be right there right next to you guys right next to you and it's not like
 it's not like God hates us when we become hateful we have this thing like God hates us if we Sim you'll hear people that God hates you if you said and gods aren't happy with your sinning it's not like that when you say God still loves you it's just like you're just choosing to turn away from God. Still right next to you right there for you but we're just turning our back and we're indulging in the stuff that's taking us down and that is junk food for the consciousness
junk food for the soul junk food for the mine and like spinning us around on that one of those lazy Susans we're facing. We can look at God would give him the holy name and then we just start out and about face and then we're facing towards all the muck and this stuff is addictive and we got to start to notice this is how the mind gets addicted to the nonsense in the same way you can get addicted to the healthy to the healing each one has a ripple effect how it affects our next choice what do you think about that is stupid and I would take it even one step further yeah do that and then I'll take that and then another better a better step further do that one better not only is a junk food I mean in what sense you can say junk food is poison but it's like it's actually like poison
 right now it's one thing to just kind of waste
find a way on on trivial stuff but it's another thing when it's actually fostering a feeling of hatred and we're embracing it and marinating are our Consciousness sitting here that Mara marinating marinating your Consciousness I'm going to use marinated in these feelings of hostility
 it's it's ignorance
 and it's entirely counter-productive to to yoga to what you want to become for the most part because all of us here listen to podcast often times we know what we want to become we know the direction we want to move and that is counter to it that's like I ate healthy all day and I'm just going to have a huge and you know what we're seeing play out here in about time again and again is will be instructions and how to practice we've been reading about how to practice as a household or how to practice as a renunciate how to practice as a
young renunciate student at you know like all these different things to come down but they keep bringing us back in a little instruct us how to do ritual little stretches to do these different practices but it always keep come back and pointing out that
 this all is important and how it plays out in terms of how you relate to other people
 you know it is it always is mental to grant us a vision of God within our own heart and God was in the heart of every living being in a feeling of spiritual Oneness or spiritual Unity based on that Vision they're all driving towards that and so hatred this kind of hate you this kind of party spirit that that goes beyond just party spirit and becomes actual to like intense animosity it's entirely counter-productive and did not own it end of those feelings going on in the body all of that anxiety and and jaw clenching and all that that we've been talking about where they are that these medical experts
identifying those are that's your body telling you that this stuff isn't good for you and her that's your that's your body saying hey dude stop marinating in hate you know you got to let go of this you just are your suffering
 get ready for this election cycle don't let it make you hate it now wherever you're at and get in the intense he's going to turn up over the next couple months if they I feel like it's already turned up and I'm going to pull back I'm going to pull back I'm going to I'm going to lean into Christian I'm going to lean into a better in my mind I'm going to win it to physical health there's so many interesting things to learn it to study than all this nonsense that it is that you're getting you're not even getting objective truth anyway you're getting some spin yeah it's like if there's a divorce in a family you just hearing what one side anyway with all the ritual with all their hate your hearing that side and we've talked about this before but I was just thinking about it
 I just yes
say we have that 10 and see it's kind of you know it will culture 10 and see of aggressiveness towards others hostility towards others you know encountering it with aggressive behavior it may even just be conversational right like we speak about people in aggressive ways or we interact with people you know in aggressive ways let's say through dialogue
 and we become accustomed to that it becomes our you know it has a r r feeling of identity is tied to it you know that I'm right and they're wrong and I can end this and you know and then we get a tractor to yoga we got to track to the bhakti
 and then we don't we may it certainly in the early stages of our practice
 we we may stay at this early stage if you're not careful for a very long time even lifetime but in those early stages of the practice
 those Tennessee
you still in us and they just come they just transferred into the world of bhakti so are Tennessee to be hostile to criticize others and hers into the realm of bhakti and I were directing it us to defending and we need to be parents someone else down now we're doing hey you're wrong about you doing you're taking your you do whatever I called taking your bad habits into sacred circles or if you even my father used to gamble with pennies with his friends so I used to watch that as a lost big you lose like fifty cents right but you go to Vegas in Vegas you're playing with big ships at $5,000 chip right at $10,000 chip so when you start making the same offenses that you made in the material world a sex sarcasm taking people down criticize digging into their shortcomings really
looking for their shortcomings you take that into sacred circles you destroyed your strength makes anyone in a high position once that you've adopted that mindset once you bring those habitat we've seen it happen with the I tell you we've seen great people leave Krishna Consciousness because they couldn't get them up this one habit which is feeling like you know everything in this person is so bad it's it's it's overlooking all their good and just going towards their bad and letting the whole world know how bad they are be super duper careful alright
 you are a little little little Thursday warning on the show today
 trying to mess with you and that I'm sure I even wrote them.
we're starting to see my baggage, which is every means of Conquest what you are respectful of basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan don't you know and Ricci the super most human being I'm going to start watching the goddess of learning and she'll be asked today if the author not stopped right about 3 to talk to you about the regular tennis and classes in the Bog of Tom and by rendering service a tube at least Troublesome to the heart will become eradicated loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise a transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fat Alma Keanu camera on the porch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their load of speed-reading from the shoe my bag of times
 Canto 7 chapter 15 text one it's a new chapter and title
instructions for civilized human beings
 is a big word civilized yeah we throw it around she play the van The Vedic teachings have a whole interesting perspective on what civilized is and it's got nothing to do with like putting your elbows on the table
 it's got to do with whether you can regulate your senses the animals regulate their senses
 so well you must have the ability to or not to regulate your mind or not to regulate your mind great topic
 so we we ended the last chapter hearing how the household is supposed to engage in
 sacrifices you don't like it you know giving up something
voluntarily with a goal of uplifting their own Consciousness and uplifting others and you know worship was spoken about and worship of God and a temple was mentioned but it again it is kind of directed at more towards seeing God in people and part of all we can do is kind of recognize that in people and make offerings in the Brahmin as we're kind of established as these there should be some people in society that our lives simply have deep spiritual realization or kind by nature and kind of live for the benefit of others you know that's what a barometer is doing right there and those people should be recognizing and it's auspicious to support them you know to respect them and support them that that that act the very Act of doing that not only you know kind of
 not only maintains a social kind of order by making sure that those people don't just fizzle out that we support you know that we Financial
for that side of of society but also that it really benefits The Giver
 how to be thinking that way to 222 within their own mind and heart you know kind of holding sacred sacred people and cultivating that through their actions in through the words and so on so we're going to continue in that vein here in this next chapter word starts with this text one and this is not a Muni speaking my dear some promises are very much attached to fruitive activities summer attached to austerities and penances still others study The Vedic literature where I some although very few cultivate knowledge and practice different yoga specially bhakti yoga
 a person next to a person desirey Liberation Force forefathers or himself should give charity to a barometer who adheres to Ghana Nishka or impersonal monism
absence of such an advanced brahmana charity may be given to a barometer addicted to fruit of activities or, comme Des Moines about who they are and where they're at right and we should be searching
 for the ones that they're really elevating out of time is generally not even dipping into these areas right again and Karma will reckon we're transcending all of that we're transcending the desire to the karma the karmic under the, division of the of The Vedic literature which is all about cultivating material prosperity
 and again a condo that is the part that's there about you no written about cultivating renunciation and letting go of the world and transcending the the suffering of this world were also not even interested in that we're interested in the vine love which is kind of a synthesis of the two
 and
but here you know what this rent-a-truck of our two comments on these forces because that would be the question that comes up with with someone study this and he say that in the householder stage
 well I read exactly says he says it's mention here that the householders Desiring The Liberation should serve the senior Aziz
 because the subject of Liberation is also included in these last five chapters
 do those practicing your body should not perform, the devotees who are householders are included when discussing, Indiana cuz they're living in a world where these things are there are you know if you're if you're maintaining a family on some level you need to maintain some material prosperity and if you're dealing with the sufferings of that year you you need to address at 23 says however
 but by performing these actions of karma through appointed Representatives just as bar to or unbury stood to preserve the normal so
do standards they do not produce obstacles to bhakti
 so he did this goes back to what we were discussing and you know like last week we're like the householder is not like their consulate confronting people to rise to the higher-level the kind of working with in the world that they're in you know they're kind of accepting but always having that internal
 but the understanding always operate in the background so you know you met you as about to do you may be particularly in this Vedic
 Society you might be asked to perform a ritual for your forefathers right and you end in you're doing it according to the presets they are and it's meant to help them become free from you know that they won't take a negative birth in their next life or whatever and you're doing that but internally or what you're really thinking is may they be connected to God may they find Divine love you no external you
you going along with you at the social norms those not everybody's going to understand that and the social norms are helpful in Progressive for society but internally as a bunch of yoga you reaching for something deeper
 I text 3
 During the period for offering ablations to the demigods one should invite only to brahmas and while offering ablations to the forefathers 19 b r a promise or in either case only one Brahmin will suffice even though one is very opulent you should not Endeavor to invite more barometers or make various expensive Arrangements on those occasions and there's a reason given for this that it's mention that if many relatives were invited the respect to the forefathers would be overlooked
 when you get too many family
did you feed many Brahmin is a relative's during the shredda ceremony there will be discrepancies in the time place respectability and ingredients the person do we worship and the method of offering worship it's a little less formal when one gets the opportunity of a suitable auspicious time and place one should with love offer food prepared with key to the deity of the Supreme personality of godhead and then offer the prashad to a suitable person a vaishnava or a barometer this will be the cause of everlasting prosperity and I will not talk about the material Prosperity hear Everlasting Prosperity means in the spiritual realm right now about what I'm saying this is the more important thing right give people good Prasad that'll that'll take us out to the spiritual level
 what should I offer Prasad to the demigods the saintly persons ones for Father's the people in general once family members one's relatives and one
friends seeing them all as devotees of the Supreme personality of God had that Vision division that's the vision were supposed to have her yeah the vision of the bus to Yogi Tower seeing everything in connection to that route that's what we're cultivating the next to it I think a beautiful about people or into spreading the message of God had spreading the message of the personality of godhead spreading the message of Krishna Consciousness is we're not looking at people as a you disconnected jackass you're saying here is a few or so and they don't even know it they don't they think they're this a religion they think their material as they think they are a Republican or Democrat they think of their American they think you're black or white or particular gender preference they're holding on to that identity is self and it's cheating them out of the Joyce making them lean into their tribal consciousness
I'm like this and they're like that and my people don't like their people and then we're helping them remember what they already are and that's what we are at everybody in the show we we should be thinking about how can I give this to somebody else and we do it not in a condescending way like sometimes we might have been preached to either maybe within bhakti or maybe maybe with the street preacher or something like that we've been preached to in the condescending way we want to condescend the ideas what we're Spirit souls and we're in the process of waking up and part of us waking up is to assist others to remind them what they are and so we go into that relationship as I see this person in general one's family members or one's relatives and one's friends seeing them all already
 as devotees of the Supreme personality of God that they are devotees they just forgot you know I noticed that that is a great point right now that I know said achoo
on the chapel he has to go do you know it is in relation to our discussion about hey he said what if you're feeling hate involuntarily like it's in you and you and you don't want it in you you know it's not good for you and you want to let it go but still it records destroying your peace of mind is a technique that can be applied to change this and I think this verse speaks to that I mean of course we could say right off the bat you know identify what's during those thoughts up in you and in refrain from it and you were talking about you know minimizing news coverage and stuff like that but here at this idea there's two elements here if we were to take text 6 and say okay to two years away too kind of counteract feelings of hate within yourself it's kind of address into Waze in this verse 1 says seeing your relatives or friends or family members people in general seeing them cultivating a vision of them as devote
of God or connected to God right in that we do to hearing that we do through Reading Baba, discussing these things like that to a standard daily kind of dose of medicine to that but then it also takes it a step further you goes into one's action right want you to offer Prasad to them right once you feed them actually serve them you know
 Prasad distribution at a time and it's really one of the most it is very powerful it's a very powerful that you know if you look at all the different yogurt cultures none of them stress Prasad distribution like the bhakti path right it is actually it's a very large and important part of our practice in order to compare the Eucharist but this really what did I ever tell you that story when Prophet was in LA
any and he was meeting with you know how he would meet in his room they yeah with the priests or anybody desk yeah and there was a there was a priest there and then you do and then a group of his own disciples were gathered there too so they're all together in the room and the priest was like blown away like you know imagine the LA temple in 1970 for some of the places explode young people just got in the bikes given their life in the Catholic church and the temple is it used to be a church used to be our building and and the priest said the prophet he was very open-minded you know good-hearted recently said you know I'm so impressed with it all the young people are losing interest in our church
 but you have all these young people in there just so enthusiastic about giving her life to God how do you do it
 and
and and probably Sarah I believe it in the thing was they were feeding
 love Germans to the guest into the priesthood eating one loves you and really appreciate it and gloves you meant for those that don't know is this very unique creation read my book you'll learn all about the Benjamins it it's it's it's almost like it's made out of powdered milk that's been deep-fried in a ball and it was soaked in Aunt Jemima syrup is kind of like a milk pancake balls yeah absolutely delicious so this priest was I really appreciate it probably said in response to a question I had to get all these young people say I understand in your church you serve this wafer
 they replaced the wafer with this club German
Body of Christ amen but the blood in their mouth on your hand hole that little plate underneath you dribble the dribble play it's cold and dribble play put under you and Casey a jewel is a huge part this this cooking an offering of Prasad and B if you look at crock pots instructions about the shooting for Sodom he's got reams of stuff on that you know when his letters and and so on and when he came you know when he came to New York very first thing you did was just kind of start training up people in how to cook you know it's like that the experience when you came to his program at 26 2nd Avenue the very first storefront little Temple was you coming there you do kirtan you talk about Bhagavad Gita and then you'd have this incredible spiritual food should that that you know that's the sea
Android kind of method for for practice you know it's such a powerful thing like a I know yourself and myself a just walk around India to go buy some Temple you're going on a trip from going to a holy place and then somebody will be like just Distributing a pot of kids real simple stuff too but it's something about getting food that in person giving food but if the food is also prepare Consciousness by special person right who's thinking this isn't offering to Lord Vishnu and then they're Distributing that to you and is there some type of exchange from the gift-giver gets and the receiver gets in if you've ever done Rashad distribution I know we have a big bunch of listeners were listening today from the Philly crew that you pour shot distribution of the places where people are actually starving not just anybody it's very very appreciated but it's something also happens to their heart and I've also heard
people who are sort of like not devotees with friends of mine and they'll just go yeah you know I go to that govinda's restaurant in Los Angeles and
 I put a lot of vegan restaurants have been something about the food yeah you and me before we were teenagers and people would say that.
 I don't put anything in the food in the food they didn't sprinkle some magic like mine melt drug they put love in the food and that's what you're tasting that sounds crazy sounds far-fetched sounds metaphysical and woo that's what it is and you feel it you feel like these people care about me and we didn't get in the habit of when people come to your house how can we feed them for shot next feed them feed them per shot cooking for this cook with love and I'll feed it to anyone that I feel hate for especially then yeah that's how we started this conversation
but you hate if you could shoot us a new struggling with with the inert hatred towards something or somebody I always back to that point about this is all this for sure I've said it was great it was the back to the original point but enough of it now I'm hungry but but I think you know I pray my way to deal with when I'm feeling that surge of hate for somebody you pray for the people that you really resentful of and in the praying for those people if it's sort of like it's like a judo flip for my you know because the Maya wants you to hate what Maya wants to keep you in the material world and then when you're like okay you want to hit you up I want to hate okay how about praying for them and have it prank for your success their good fortune and they're deep, deep spiritual connection
 you know always one of my favorite sections of the bug of agita is in the third
chapter where it's being described in trying to find that part of mama trying to find God within your own heart
 and and after describe the different methods and wasted at describing the par mama and then the way that people find Parma within themselves then it says he's trying to find this year
 one who sees the Super Soul
 accompanying the soul and all bodies
 I don't understand that neither the soul nor the Super Soul within the destructible bodies ever destroyed they are actually seeing what everybody else is blind these are the people that are seeing and then it says some
 want to see the Super Soul equally present everywhere in every living being
 does not degrade himself by his mind unless he approaches the transit and destination and that hatred that's that's like the worst degradation of the mind you know that's
like that's where we really lose it that's when our heart is entirely
 out of alignment with the heart of God so we did the yoga is always really cultivating that feeling of God within their own heart
 because it's that's exactly what would prevent them from feeling hate for others and it or will facilitate their feeling up for others but you know what you said right now it's about love being cooked into the food I would say I don't do we have Stacy here with us today Stacy Lisa Cabrera has here cuz her yes she is her brother
 is Perry Farrell.
 And he'll see how are you
 you getting asked to unmute Stacy listeners was in the Sages
 he put on after he did Lollapalooza start this other Fest so I forget what it's called
thank you yeah and and he held that in New York in the New York area and he asked all the devotees from the Brooklyn Temple to come and cook for that and then I remember he was on mvt on MTV and he was saying that he was saying you know this is what we're doing at this Festival special for this reason and that reason and he said and all the food is going to be cooked and provided by the Hari Krishna devotees and when they cook they cook the food in the food they cook love into the food and when you tasted you'll feel it I remember he said that
 so it is kind of like something that people can really perceive you know I ain't been I don't know if this is he doing the time but like when I was talking about going to talk to me about it is Perry was he was he he became famous he started to do really great things introducing great things to lots of people are sharing love and kindness and
honesty and and all of the things that we talked about and been the last ten years has become
 I don't know who he is he had tons of plastic surgery physically he changed his whole look he has become completely like everything is like look at me like I think that's when we were having a conversation with radhika I really wanted to unmute you there but we sort of flew by but that's a whole nother interesting topic of dealing with the or how we always say on the podcast Good Karma can ruin your life and you know because he's done that type of service Richard distribution in a very focused way like that what you did and basically change the destination of so many people by Distributing prashad and with that with a Very Potter I remember him
Oakland Temple
 whatever is going through right now the the the fishhook of bhakti is caught in his heart and krishna's got some wonderful plan for him until we might be seeing him going through some personal hell but he's in the devotees prayers and Christian is not forgot all that service that he did but we should also worried about our own good, as well cuz Good Karma can ruin your life Fame is a very powerful energy and unless you build and we might think we're really above all this stuff and then if things get dumped on her lap I probably stay so you probably witnessed things like that all of a sudden goes from like he's my brother and now he's like ice Superstar celebrity and that stuff can happen on a dime
 and people can't handle it that's understandable it's like telling a junior electrician to go up and start working
you know starting workout in at Three Mile Island or something like that it's just this is my conviction that Christians opulence is right beside their six documents is knowledge Fame well except we can't handle very much he can handle them unlimitedly when we get even a little bit of one of them you know a little too much of one of them yeah we can't handle it you know give us too much wealth we can't handle that give it too much pain we can't have to fix it complements my beer the other day I'm like
 yeah give us too much Beauty we can't handle it give us even a little bit is too much for us to do and so when people become famous they can be tougher let's try to get him some Prasad and I think that's the answer here you know yeah and even yeah when we when we hear stories like that all we do is reach out and love we're not like attic I was never sincere just want to read what we want to reach out to love and see what they say that they have done
 but anyway
sexy thanks for sharing that I got to share one thing for second I really hope you're right because he has like I saw something online with him and he was talking about how he was playing chess with his son and how he feels like his son doesn't really want to be around him and so he's trying to connect with him by playing chess and that those are nice that that's something new that I know and I was like wow like he's he's turned himself into someone that he thinks he's up here and all of us are down here and and there's something and he just have special things happening but I do hope what you
I said Rock a knife is that he that that that he hears the prayers of the prayers get to him because
 I cry I get very sad and in George will tell you of what he's turning into and his wife they call his wife Yoko Ono him away from everybody and he's allowed a lot of distraction distraction
 and just without any expectation just send it to me I love you I care about you and just send that pissed you I miss you. Love in it and yes I got this from the temple or something like that I was thinking about you today but that when you go in there
if we go in with this unit with no judgment cuz judge makes people recoil love makes people open and you got a lot of love I know both you guys you both are very loving couple and and we don't know what would happen to us if we were in such a situation so witnessing this we pray and we try to connect with love with not without condemnation but I have deep deep faith that people who offered and made made a contribution to bhakti Krishna is using their karma now to crush their ego and it'll come somehow and when the Eagles crushed there's nothing left to turn to open up except Krishna Krishna will give it till take it all away and then the person's going to be left wow what a phantasmagoria is probably it's a fantasma fantasma Gloria and it is like watching Like a Star Wars film
 it almost said it just crumbles everything Chrome
and your left dinner with Krishna it's a very beautiful thing and he's going to use his karma in the same way as using your, your ups and downs your good fortune in your loss and everybody who's going through it in the material world you're not alone out there Chris is going to use everything that you're going through to bring you closer and closer right now you might some of us might feel I'm so far from Krishna as long as you render that service to the Bison of us render that service to Krishna he's got you on a long line at any moment he just going to really a Krishna cares also he's not just like the deity away from us that we love and he's sort of like this nonchalant Krishna is recalling reclaiming Us in the same process and I have a few the prasada I have a I have a friend a very spiritual friend who I haven't seen in a long time and I know he has like a taste for your tongue but you know he's not going to call me regular Harry Krishna
he sent me this message and I just reconnected with him and he's just like a guy of Integrity that I just like resonate with this guy and so we went for a walk the other day and said that they spiritual conversation I won't even say Krishna conscious conversation but he's listen to a podcast a few times and likes it and then he sent me this message because I just took my family vacation got a Airbnb and they are so beautiful picture like he opens the door and this is just beautiful I can't remember who is Radha Krishna or she even par booty goes rocking out there was like some type of Miracle Ear in the Airbnb it was clear that it would be was a beautiful than a bridge bossy painting of deities when he walked in randomly and so here's the deal you've take a little step towards Krishna he takes a thousand running steps towards you and sometimes we're turning away from Krishna inside Christmas is okay if you were ever a fisherman you know you left the slack out but it was the drag out on the line you let the
I think he's free he's not free the hooks been set anytime Krishna can really listen and that's what Krishna does but he wants to exhaust us the same way the fisherman is exhausting the fish and then once we give up with try to enjoy the material world then you realize you have
 write it with the Prasad yeah I'm jumping all right we got through at 9 today 9 with the verse about hate but we'll get there tomorrow okay popex
