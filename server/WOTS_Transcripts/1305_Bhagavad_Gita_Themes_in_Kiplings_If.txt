but yeah if you're interested a harmonium check them out Royal harmonium. Com
 we have a big nugget today and it's another Rudyard Kipling nugget who was born was one of those English Indians born in English Delia or India won in the British India British India during the
 British Raj some of the British Raj yeah he was there and
 is very very prolific and empowered writer
 but anyway I'm okay leads to too much about him he can get a little
 controversial leave it at that anyway let's you know yesterday we were at a quote from him and then on the message board Sunny the cat your attention
 to this poem which I'd heard before
odds for the third famous poem If
 I'd like to Sunny the cat mention that you know people draw parallels with this poem in the bug of agita sea-ice there's no doubt no doubt well yeah I mean it's
 it's very impressive like like was he influenced by the Gita was he just a wise person a deep person but since he grew up in Hindi I think it's pretty safe to assume that this is you know they were Direct
 influences here
 it's beautiful palmen in very well very well expressed yeah you know sometimes a writer can or speaker can speak on the topic
 and you know it is helpful invaluable when we speak on these suck dick topics or
but but then somebody take it to another level take a little bit deeper and that is that deeper levels that it I think it's where the transformation takes place at maybe we can discuss this as we read through you know what it's like reading straight through it so it's a it's a it's a it's a powerful poem that I could stop every two lines because I think we probably do need to stop but it would just what I want to share was in my in my life I've seen you know I I live in a community of followers of the bug of agita
 and so you know we all accept it we accept this message we appreciate its message we intend to live according to it
 but they'll be some Among Us who Embrace its message on Ariana still deeper level you know it other words there's a tenant Tennessee to say okay except that I live by that and then we sort of settle in a certain level
we settle into what we settle into is our previous habits often times and times when you get read a book get inspired by a book but the book doesn't change us even if it does change this even if we do take a better habits in and so on you know
 we still may just kind of leave it there but that the spiritual path of me always digging deeper always you know it doesn't you don't just settle you got to go to deeper and deeper levels and I see sometimes what he seems to be indicating what what I'm picking up in his poem is he'll talk about that one level and then I'll take it to that deeper level
 anyway let me read
 it helps if that's the name of the poems if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it blaming it on you if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
make a wild ones for their doubting too
 and I think that's like just the major theme in this release a major theme in this pump keep your head about you you know this is the summit phone right this is even mindedness when you know others are being affected by the externals and losing you know is losing their heads in a sense that only affected by the externals but there are affected by the externals and blaming you and there's that second level for you to keep equipoise when others are not it's another thing when others are not and they're actually directing it with some personal animosity toward this year like cancel culture and its best the point where you could say you know what I don't need to keep my head anymore because they're blaming it on fairly on me so it's Justified it's it is rationalize my own
 unsteadiness
but know if we want to go deeper even when they're blaming it on us whether be fair or unfair sure you have to keep that even mind that's the next level in okay they're tricky stuff right here
 if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you write your friendly foot is right but make allowance for their doubting too and there's that openness that one needs rise if I was blaming you for a bunch of stuff if you can sit back and say you know what
 I meant instead of just being oh yeah you said you weren't alone maybe they do have some points here maybe I should be a little supper flective it's not easy know how do you see if you can be if you can wait and not be tired by waiting patients you or being lied about and still don't deal in lies no vindictiveness and one or being hated
 don't but
don't give way to hate it very important to be hated and not give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk to why is it important to discuss
 like the Haiti went or being hated don't give way to a I think you and you and I discussed this a lot I think
 but it almost with the rise of social media with the kind of I don't know if falling apart kind of the collapse of like
 healthy sources of news with another words that within the culture of Journalism when we were going up there were some of course news is always going to be slanted a little this way that way but there's some journalistic standards
that were maintained that kept somewhat of a balance in the news that you get in today we tend to get our news from from from sources that are very opinionated
 the presenters are almost purchased in the often there is an element of of hatred of animosity within it a mockery of hatred so so when we when when that's where we're getting our news from all over the place we feel
 it's not for the kind of following that path and it's also we may feel that I need to take a stand right we're getting pressured if you don't take a stand if you're just sitting on the fence then you're just as bad as you acted upon to the whole problem you are scum you can I think about it and
this side you know are a hundred percent convinced in it and have their arguments that they were entirely right and everything that they're doing is just of what happened and they didn't even gather all the facts yet and then the other side is is doing or sometimes he's about long historical issues and and and if you even try to see from the Ballast Point of View do you get blamed if you get blamed and you're the reason why this is happening so even without being hated to not give way to hating his is challenging in this age what to speak of when it's being aimed at you and we see that you know if we read the histories of great Saints any spiritual tradition
 commonly we'll see cuz you know what this whole poem is about
it's about being tested in a sense right is right here is here to test that life gives you rather than just see them as like problems in life see the best in life and then try to rise to the test and so beautiful way to look at a beautiful way to frame out any challenge you're going through yeah actually going through it came up to me recently like I'm going through this personal hell right now and that's exactly what I had to say I was like this is going to be over in a moment Krishna just want to see how you're going to react and there you go to the test way of putting it like you know here's the test what if you know if you responded this way you know what if rather than seeing it as just drudgery
 problem Etc said what if you saw it as a test and in Rose up and responded to it so
it's challenging is challenging in this day and age not to give way to hate it's it's even more challenging when it's pointed at you and and instill you don't give way to it and that's why I'm saying like it we read any any spiritual tradition when they give the the the lives of the Saints we see that practically and every case they had to respond to hatred people that misunderstood them people that were envious of them that that that persecuted them how did they respond it's almost always going to be in a course in Jesus he's on the cross can you saying you know dear father forgive them and is being whipped and he's forgiving you know he's always there it's amazing how it's not like these guys are in the Ku Klux Klan or something please or people practicing austerity renunciation prayer and still people will go out of their way to find fault with them and take them down there not do their not you know a blower
mailboxes with m-80s or not spray painting on your door that I was kind of human trafficking these are just like good people practicing a spiritual life and still people are going out of their way to find fault with them when it comes our Direction
 rather than going into it to some kind of
 some kind of fit over it
 one can just recognize all will if I'm going to be a saddle in this life if I'm going to live as a saint in this life will then of course I'm going to have to be tested of course that's going to have enough how could How Could my worthiness to be a fool hearted surrender to God not going tested so well I welcomed the test that you know that's a mature level of thought that's it that's a deeper person in
 and we have to learn this what you know if we're going to go deeper into it we have to do is keep breathing
if you can okay next next stanza if you can dream a hold of the we missed an important line there and then then that's in that sense and yet so if you can or being hated don't give way to hating and yet
 don't look too good nor talk too wise
 which seems to be to me is that I read that as a
 as a call to beware pretentiousness
 right cuz like even if I do come in a sentence passed the test I don't complain I bear the the drudgery of are the criticism I bear that he born towards me but then I start to the Night Comes the next sodel mayak test right look at me I'm the saying so you know or you lies back and chop them down whooping shopping you down so I can do that then you didn't then you didn't then you did give way to hate you.
say you pass that test and you didn't give way to hate now you begin to to embrace the external facade of I'm the wise one I'm the good one I am the Saint David another layer of Illusion sometimes I'll dip into these political debates and eat when someone something obviously wrong and the other side comes back in like Bodyslam I don't do it with Grace they deliver I asking us like you fools it and it just makes you lose they all lose they all lose again that to me that's the first line of that you know that's not giving way to hate and that's challenging enough but let's say you passed that test
 let's say you don't write the nasty reply you reply you know in a very
 in a way that's far more sensitive
 but then then
next challenge the next illusions that you begin to present yourself with the facade of being the Wise One the pure one the saintly one that the name of that dentist third level third level of subtlety third level of Detachment third level of for the for the 4th of October in a third level of devotional response
 all right here's the next stanza if you can dream and not make your dreams your master if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim it is you're so how do you read those
 truthfully I'm a little blank on those two I mean I could extrapolate something but I don't want to just go off on an indulgent tangent that might not be what he's doing and grab them. I mean I think these are very important I think again you know we can approach The Vedas if the bug of agita that and what did these sacred teachings of volleyball tournament and rather than
the true motive of I need to be transformed by them I need to make myself vulnerable to them and be transformed by them
 we can just make thinking about it the a.m. and talkin about it the aim you know again it's it's has to do with facade you know or superficiality the I was taking it like dream like you have these ideas I would like to do this I'd like to do that and let to do this but not but understand like these are dreams these are my ideas of goals but I'm also relinquish the gods go or make sure you know I'm not going to be attached to that dream this is what I'm thinking but it might not be a divine plan there that's how I read that this morning about it if you can meet with Triumph and disaster
 and treat those two Impostors just the same posture an imposter is someone who is
appearing as something else and they are and so we consider try for disaster or we could even say
 Pleasure and Pain you know happiness and distress
 you know the court Skeeter speaking so much about this right you know right off the bat I'm getting more appreciation with bug of agita reading this phone yeah yeah you know she told us we could do good out of the the winter and summer seasons, you know your tongue to tongue stick to two pictures of a border to what has to learn to tolerate them recognizing assuming from the beginning that this world is going to go up and down up and down they're going to try and put my life there's going to be a disaster in my life but these are imposters that you know the posing as if they're more meaningful than they really are and the wiser person is is a Saiga I know there's going to be trying for
I know there's going to be disaster in the life they
 come in in guise of being results of my own efforts
 when really I give my effort and attached to the results you know and I accept what it is tonight and I just keep you know I just keep serving
 okay
 if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken with stood by the knaves to make a trap for fools do you ever feel like that way to your straight edge
 of course I'm kidding never had since I was seventeen years old and I still get it doesn't end you know it's it happened before internet there was just magazines and fanzines or just gossip ever was going to get this what you got a body you're going to get detractors people try to take you down
it's not just that in other words to me this is saying something more than that if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken spoken to it like I tried to give something good to the world and people came and they twisted and started using it for evil in the world
 sure it's kind of just got it it might take the wind out of your sails and might make one cynical sure why bother Why Try been there done that to almost did it recently things you gave your life to Broken right leg is broken and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools so important you know I think that that can apply to one's family because you know where I've seen Appliance within institutions you know you give your life to try to build something up and then
the way things work in this world other people get involved in the things broken you're like all that I gave my life to that you know she wanted now you can become bitter or will you even stoop down and and just try to help in any way that you can even with worn-out tools right without saying but I did this and I did that and you wouldn't you broke it. You just keep trying to help you it's nothing but positive nothing but positive energy here right nothing but positive thinking no cynicism no resentment I'm just keep trying to serve the higher purpose
 yeah that was my life these last two lines for the last two years I think
 if you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss
 that must be some popular game
 sort of like toss across
checking on rolling dice or something and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss that's theirs have no resentment no complaining if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew sinew sign in to serve your turn long after they are gone. Hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them hold on
 why do all of this whole time if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after the going to do not serve you serve your turn means
 now I think what this is is that if you can push yourself if you can rather than fall victim to laziness
 if you can push yourself
in your body what you're giving right you're giving your you have your heart in your nerve in your vicinity I think is like your tendons and so on
 you know if you can take your body take this machine that were given to work with use it for the good use it for the good not in a selfish way but even after you're gone even after your body is gone you want to work in such a way where like you know they say that like people that plant trees knowing that they're never going to be able to have the fruit from them you know that cuz you you're serving because it's the right thing to do rather than because you can you can take the fruit yourself
 okay
 if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with Kings nor lose the common touch very beautiful sometimes you hang out with famous people important people we try to lose a bit of our
it's saying I think it's a no on both ends here right like whether you're so shading with common people can I get there's one way you can be corrupted in that it shorten that sound good in that Association or you can be meeting with you know that the Elites at the end of the rare people amongst society that there's another way you might be corrupted by that but can you walk through this world without being corrupted and it's different forms of songa
 if neither foes nor loving friends can be can hurt you like that neither foolish nor loving friends can hurt you most like you have to have a resilience I love that concept of you can't hurt me I can only allow you to hurt me like I have the governance sure you know nice very thin-skinned and we allow people to affect us almost too much it seems we're if we're just locked into our own person
Albert you connected to Krishna
 nothing can hurt us it's such an empowered way to live and it's not it's like saying you can't hurt me but is in out in other words so even even through the test one ones
 love for the other that might even be causing the potential hurting isn't lost
 steep so if neither foolish nor loving friends can hurt you if neither of all men count with you but none too much count if you're concerned about everyone
 call Mike count there's nobody that doesn't count here they're okay they don't matter but they all matter but not too much I'm not you know I'm not favoring favorite
over the other I have no friends I have no enemies in that sense right I see everyone at the unforgivable minute with sixty seconds not unforgivable Unforgiven Unforgiven you can fill the unforgiving minute sorry with them with switches also, seem like time is not going to stop
 with sixty seconds worth of distance run means that you used all your time fully you didn't waste any time
 yours is it yours is the Earth and everything that's in it and which is more you'll be a man my son you know what he must have run into some Sage who was like tutoring him or can I see something and he's sitting with him on a regular basis he's in like this colonial British Raj India
where the British are running things are employing all the sophisticated you know the Mercantile people and thinkers and work they're there they round sahibs as they call them and so they like they're working everything and he's just running and meeting sagacious people and sitting with them and just listening and like and start making it his own and culturally appropriating it I don't call this culture for his wisdom and sharing it is what it is it's on the way it's when you read this entire poem and what it is is really it's like a map of Karma Yoga
 you know to be in this world and out of it to to give yourself and work in this world not become corrupted by the world why because you have no personal motive in it because you're not striving for the sink you're doing with the attachment you're doing it because it's the right thing to do because it's normal because his virtuous sure
you know and in the test will come in so many different forms and if you can continue to respond with kind of virtuous attachment then you've actually understood then he said the Earth and everything in it is yours I understand that is it saying that then you've understood you know you're everything that you're meant to gain in your Earthly existence you will gain otherwise you're going to be distracted and diverted and caught up in cycles and loops and in go nowhere but can you move through this with that's that's that's where the key to went where the previous text hadn't gone right that you don't find that so much a new pontiff shots you know Vedas are about enjoying this world so you know the pies way and punish a Zara
 about walking away from this world with wisdom with attachment bug of agita sex it take that wisdom take that Detachment in the world and move through the world
in this virtuous detached way that's essentially what this this poem is all about and yeah it's bugging me geeta's just woven all through out it beautiful. Into the bog of town my friend there was other youngsters if I mean it sounds like it's a father speaking to the sun now we have both youngsters less used to try to schedule some other gentleman my son oh yeah okay my son cuz doula
 you're right on the mosquitia that I'm China. Your mom didn't satisfy him before he started to shoot my bag of time which is our brave means of Conquest one should offer special the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan Katha narnarayan reissue the super most human being the author
God Save Us by going to tease the muscle okay back there but a nice turkey a regular tennis in in The Bob & Tom and my rendering service a devotees all this trouble some of the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised with transcendental songs we established as an irrevocable back oh my God I thought you were done with the Domina does my issue. I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes to the torch out of knowledge and I offer my obeisance he's at their Lotus feet reading from the stream on our time
 can't 27 7:48
 x-ray 48
 all right
 the four principles of advancement in spiritual life Dharma Arthur
Moksha brightness of the Nevada seem to see the progress material existence
 all depends on a disposition
 of the Supreme personality of godhead yeah I think proposed using disposition in a way a little different than we, use it now too sure I looked it up actually and forty years or so words can change so yeah I think even I think we're going back more like a hundred and fifty years he might drop pods did they know it's the prop hunt learned but here I think this position has to do with the hi-hat I save it somewhere I can find right now but this position has to do with like how things are placed so it's it's the derangement of the Supreme personality got to do you could say right okay rather than his like mental state or right
 therefore my dear friends follow in the footsteps of devotee
without desire fully depend on their disposition of the Lord worship Him the Super Soul in devotional service sucks so he's saying all these kids are getting trained up in the Dharma Dharma heart to, kind of model
 right okay okay kids forget anything about God forget anything about any higher purpose forget anything about elevating yourself you know transcending your lower nature and all that know the purpose to life is okay will do Dharma for for Motivated purpose because through it will gain wealth and through that we can fill our material desires and that's the purpose of life go out there are you going to that interesting we were performing some religious practice just so we can have money get our senses needed and so he has different than the entire fate of teaching
not teach you how to just be happy not merely had to be happy in this world is teaching how to transcend the material world yeah and transcend it in and it in its highest
 in its highest form artist way so so in one sense, Arthur, most of that is progression
 but he's turning to the tell the kids have been trained up in this kind of materialistic Viewpoint any saying all of that that whole system of door Martha, Moksha and in the universal laws that govern it that's all the disposition that's all the arrangement of Lord Vishnu who's behind it all there's a face behind that all there's someone that arranged so why not just turned directly to him right stop playing this game that you know and meet him in person so therefore my dear friends following the footsteps of the devotees those that are dedicated to the person behind it
 end
and then whatever desires you're concerned about those will seem paltry compared to 22 the experience of of devotion we find a bhakti that and I'm sure we can agree with this one that when you have a desire Krishna does one of two things either with bills at desire or he makes you realize this is just a such a silly desire and the I realized weather for Phil's it or not
 yeah okay the Supreme personality. Had to hurry is the soul and the Super Soul of all living entities every living entity is a manifestation of his energy in terms of the living soul and the material body therefore the Lord is most dear and he is the Supreme controller
 if a demigod.
a Human Being II yaksha, those are higher higher powered beings or anyone within the universe render service to the Lotus feet of mukunda who can deliver Liberation he's actually situated in the most auspicious condition of life exactly like us meeting the Maha John's the great personalities so so he's speaking to the university ality bhakti now the demigod can practice it but even ask the demons right where are our birth
 is not at all the disqualification or we were both born in this dynasty that's just kind of antibody they say but that is not in any way you'd only human beings he's kind of lower beings can do it cuz they're up on the higher Planet start the auction has they can do it again darvas can do it anyone within the universe
and connect because every soul
 is a manifestation of the energy of Krishna whatever type of family you were born into whatever your past is there's no do something simple and I hear this a lot of people say I am just so disqualified to practice bhakti guess what you're qualified you're just qualification makes his own Pride that is larger tiniest Mercy if you feel I'm so broken I'm shattered my life's a mess guess what the doors wide-open thing you're the one we've been waiting for
 hey okay
 my dear friend's son's demons you cannot please the Supreme personality of godhead by becoming perfect Brahmin has really got me God's or great Saints or by becoming perfectly good in Etiquette or vast learning that's very interesting we got to come back to this but my dream I had the other day
Dental Dreams none of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the Lord interesting right now that these are good thing austerity that's a good thing good thing cleanliness or vows can satisfy the Lord the Lord is pleased only if one has unflinching unalloyed Devotion to him without sincere devotional service everything is simply a show interesting you know is it's almost like I don't know maybe in in literature
 there's a conception of like pure love right sometimes it's a man having to win the love of a woman and the woman standard is very high maybe she has many suitors you know but she's looking for something that's genuine
 you know she knows that men are interested in her with all kind of
my motives are selfish motives and she has no interest in them so no matter what they're putting forward she's on moved
 you should waiting for line of suitors I had a bean off the bunch of jackals trying to circle circle her Circle her for her big and meatballs
 I'm sure there are many of each other and so so so she's waiting for that you know whether it's a film or whether it sound that was kind of the groundhog day thing right where is there was only one sooner but he was coming you know when he kept coming with selfish motivation was rejected rejected she's unmoved she's unmoved by that it was only when he evolves and approached her with a motive I actually care about you I want you to be happy and I'm willing to sacrifice for the you know then she was moved and so here saying that the thing let's not
lose that what it called the forest for the trees right all these things that these great text talk about the debate has talk on such charity austerity sacrifice cleanliness these can be performed for selfish purposes I do these because I want to reap material benefits from them right that's why I'm giving charity you know or I'mma tanning vast learning or practicing perfect etiquette I'm being a very well-behaved brahmana even he even he says or being a great saint of learned tolerance and patience and it in all of these things these qualities they're the value of them the ultimate value of them the true value of them
 is that they become the fertile ground for the seed of devotion of growing and it's only that pure devotion that touches the Lord's heart that that moves him in any way it's Oprah Lots you know you say you know what in our schools were studying Nevada
Christina we're learning these things and we're being we're being taught the stuff in the context of how to read material benefits
 but none of that gets us to the point when we I'm telling you about this Divine being behind at all that we can go directly to and I want to let you know also that all these other things that seem good
 their value with their their true goodness is in there be in the fertile ground for pure devotion pure love that's the whole point to all of this and that's only thing that's going to move that person behind it all
 it's a clarification that that some it's important to be made in the end it's a clarification to Bob and Tom's going to
 set out to make
 what number are we on
 53 sometimes in my no fidgeting this I just scroll around my I understand that are my dear friends are sons of demons in the same paper bull way that one sees himself and takes care of himself
play devotional servers to satisfy the Supreme personality godhead who is present everywhere as the Super Soul of all living entities my dear friends with sons of demons in the same favorable way that one sees himself and takes care of himself
 yes take two devotional serviced to satisfy the Supreme personality but God had
 who is present everywhere as the Super Soul of all living entities so in other words like we take we make great efforts to take care of ourselves to serve ourselves right I need to make sure that I'm warm enough I need to make sure that I'm eating good food I need to make sure that I'm happy in this way and comfortable in that way and in all of that he said that effort that you make
 give it to God and recognize it and not only that but then recognize that God is within everyone
 so now I become the giver rather than to take her right because if I'm taking that same energy that I would use
in my own self care
 or you can say self-centered way if I'm offering that to God and I'm and then I'm seeing God in everyone now I've actually become the caretaker the lover of the servant of every living being you know if of God end of ever letting me say this is the way to see right this is actually the path to happiness you know the other way although it seems like a worse I'll be happy when I'm the comfortable one I'll be happy when I'm the one that's being offered everything no no no turn that around offered all the god oh yeah and and dont and dont get stuck in this immature
 Immature level of vision of God oh yeah it's okay I get it but you're saying offer to God so then I go into the temple and make an offering to God right or yes
 but through that practice you meant to see God present everywhere in within in within the heart of every living being
she got there but
 immature that Vision right there's got to be an evolution one's vision of of the Divine Right don't see the Divine merely in the temple
 I don't see God merely on the altar or in the church in a particular tradition don't don't a c with his limited Vision that that's focused on external religious symbols
 but see that Divine Essence everywhere exists and it exists within the heart of every living being served at
 it's getting deep with these kids all my friends are sons of demons everyone including you biatches and the Roshes
 the unintelligent women I guess they're looking they weren't going to school
 the sudras the Cowherd man
 I like how hard math and I guess you know cuz they're just
lizard drawing a training class of people and then there's everybody else out there the lower animals the sinful living beings whatever you're at wherever you're at work wherever you're at you can revive your original Eternal spiritual life and exist forever simply by accepting the principles about the yoga there is no external
 probably prono don't prohibited items prohibited nobody's band is it there's no one that there is a higher key idea of a hierarchy a higher Caster a higher sophisticated group and India's film with that type of structural and there's and there's a reason for it and there's some based on good reasons but the idea is that it doesn't matter anyway it's all secondary
that stuff is secondary and also the person's economic status it's all secondary everything that
 every time we we can't artificially just say that we're all equal cuz everyone is sort of different there are people that are just simple people and there's people that are very sophisticated people and their people are academic people there's people that are like athletic people they're just different class find unrefined unrefined verified everybody is qualified
 I want can't be qualified you can be sure is it our ability to connect with God is not dependent on any of those yeah I know I'm a I'm a I'm a rock Shasha Medina I was born in a family
