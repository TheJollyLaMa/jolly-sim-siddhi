 Mary Kay
yeah we got back to Recovery Group meetings today and made it noon and then we made it to and there's also in-person meetings in Alachua and Nashville that's great
 scrolling all right my friend we're going to go get to that for you but would that be from it's from Pedro Pedro ribadeneyra sjsj what is SSA stand for San Jose I don't know who I believe her first to a monk and the Order of the Jesuits Enneagram the Jesuits know maybe some modern-day Jazz would person has written on it
that sounds like I don't think they know the origin of the Enneagram look but I don't really sorry but yeah but this is a Pedro ribadeneyra has he is speaking of Saint Ignatius of Loyola who was the founder of the Jesuit order
 adjustments are pretty serious pretty serious order of monks I read a whole book about them very surrendered their knowledgeable very effective like in their mission
 what are the interesting person is Saint Ignatius of Loyola
 did Mary get something on that maybe from my understanding is that the Enneagram
that the origin of her don't quite sure of but that any case that's neither here nor there we want to hear what Pedro has to say to say we frequently saw him and being a Saint Ignatius of Loyola taking the occasion of little things to lift his mind to God Little Things little things even the smallest
 not going to start it again frequently saw him taking the occasion of little things to lift his mind to God who even in the smallest things is great right God is great even the smallest thing the smallest thing I ever look at a fly to sit there next month while instead of shoot it away what a design it's from seeing a plant foliage that's at the plant the leaves of a plant
well that's the next thing you're thinking like Saint Ignatius Alief if flour and will flowers are obvious write any kind of fruit
 that's quite amazing any kind of fruit from the consideration of little worm or any other animal he raised himself above the heavens and penetrated the deepest thoughts
 and from each little thing he'd your Doctrine
 in the most profitable councils for the spiritual life from each little thing that's Look up the word to go could you look up the word Doctrine
 a nice little thingy truth Doctrine like you got a whole teaching it you know like a hole
 you know how I hear what you said when he was a doctor a principal or position or the body of principles in a branch of knowledge or system of belief
okay I just from looking at a leaf from looking at a worm
 a rather nice looking at a fly
 he was trying so much sure your thoughts are you a man of the farm well I feel like it's once you you're immersed in nature it's easy to see God
 you have to really be dull headed to look at like even if I catch someone said to me once cuz I had chickens I have chickens now but I had chickens at one time and some other guy I met had chickens he's like about chickens are you even hanging out with these chickens have you spell yeah it's a different types of intelligence and he sort of like clue into them and Zone into them you get to know
different ways and then there is like
 the beauty of a Feather like a feather who could even create a feather and then it has a bird that can fly that's like a whole nother thing it's another mind-blowing thing and then there is you know just how they survive and how they live and how they how they feed themselves and how they nurture incredible thing like living and everything everything has a strong desire to live and how they build nests Cheese's
 you know or or you know how there's how the herbs of the Earth are perfectly designed to treat the elements in the body my God violets
violets yeah violets violets right now we got stinging nettle plant and violets and Will Cook Road and dandelion just like walk Medicine Chest that we never had some things to get rid of these things getting me God sending like these gifts God sending like a Apothecary for us and we're trying to like wipe it out and and create something that meant to do the same thing but doesn't do it as well or that comes with all kind of side effects in record and recognize the water table there's a water table there's water underground stored for us when we're thirsty
 pushes it up into a spring and then it flows over for our taking and something and it's just true in all of the minerals from the earth and are infused in that what is infused water
yeah right that's coming up and then we're just like pouring lawn fertilizer on it recognized water table fluoride in there a shocking it is so so right now I'm studying about like a reforesting deserts
 Canonbury interesting thing that's a rare that you could sit and look at lost in that Google's in that YouTube search for a while as a reforce desert unbelievable that who I so much about himself he was looking at Saint Ignatius and he's seeing how this person is finding God playing with a a dynamic here right he's looking at the tiniest things in understanding the biggest things right it is so so there's as macaron there's a micro there's there's evidence and anything that you know the faster I would think for four scientists would be fascinating to go deeper and deeper into
can you can you continue to see like you open a new door with your microscope for you open a new door with your latest Revelation about oh my goodness it's this greater design still underneath this all you do and so Saint Ignatius was kind of seeing that he was by looking at small things he was understanding fixing so he was understanding God that connection you use use the term few minutes ago you said you have to be so dull minded I don't think you've finished your sentence but I think you what you mean to say was how can you see all of this and not understand that there has to be something someone some intelligent some designer behind it all now eating because I supposed all would be one way to describe sometimes it's like over intelligent right or just sure or just you know that they're their brain may not be doll like they may
able to understand and calculate that you know things you know rapidly and it's not but it may have more to do with a disposition a psychological disposition or hesitancy to accept something peasants hasn't hesitancy due to some inner psychological thing that makes one resistant seeing what's right there I like this you know we always used to talk about the Fibonacci spiral how it's like the completely perfect no matter how small I guess no matter how big it gets and we see
 nature moving in the direction of like even like war in a war between nations and War on a college campus war in the family war in the in in the dogs in the cats that you can set up at by Pond and see okay here come the snakes and they're going after the little guppies are going after the salamanders and then you can
even lower lower you can find Wars amongst bacteria within your body and the different blood cells are fighting Wars what makes you think you can go lower lower lower and you go bigger and bigger and bigger and then there and the yogi say there's wars in the heavens amongst sora's and Soros and it just keeps going on forever what makes us think that for some reason just stops when our vision stops
 these are just that beautiful Cycles within the material nature and their observable within our range of our senses and then be as we learned to expand the senses of the microscope a little imagination with a little imagination you can see there's probably other things going on and celestial bodies much bigger than we can conceive you know I read a letter
 that was you know sometimes I think of religious people want to quote Einstein
as being a believer in God and said I believe they're like some fake you know Einstein quotes on quote so you know there's no source for them so they're there their validity this question but I found something that's that seems to be more solid this is this was taken from a book called Einstein The Human Side and in 1936 Albert Einstein wrote The Following letter to his sixth grade student her name was fully Phyllis right
 and she wrote asking she wrote to him asking whether scientist pray and if so what do they pray for
 all right this is written on January 24th 1936 by Albert Einstein and here we just see it in the reason I want to bring this up is what I appreciate in this is his objectivity he's not coming on saying I believe in God exactly
but what is but what he's doing is she deceased showing the objectivity of a of a scientist so he says I've tried to use his Deerfield as I've tried to respond to your question as simply as I could use my answer is a scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature and therefore this holds for the actions of people for this reason a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer
 iepa wish addressed to a supernatural being okay so he saying this is the way scientists operate generally with a certain assumption as you know a presumption that everything that takes place is according to the laws that we identified
 but then he goes on to say however
 it must be admitted that our actual knowledge of these law
is only imperfect
 and fragmentary or fragment remains like we just have little pieces in the not even tied together
 you know so so that actually the belief in the existence of basic all-embracing laws of nature also rests
 on a sort of faith
 okay now that's subjective you saying that we are making presumptions and it's our face that they are correct
 so you saying someone says he saying we're all investing in faith one way or another
 I'm all the same this faith has been largely Justified so far by the success of scientific research so he's swinging this way then you swing back that way and then he's waiting back to see now he goes any swings again but on the other hand
 everyone of us who is in this I think this relates to what we're reading this morning turned out this morning but on the other hand everyone who is seriously in
hold in the pursuit of science as interesting what he might mean by seriously perhaps he means objectively right it with a real eagerness to understand truth everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest
 in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly Superior to that of man
 in one in the face of which we with our modest Powers must feel humble
 is today to a six-year-old again this back so he says okay but on the other hand one who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that is Spirit
is Manifest in the laws of the universe is Spirit vastly Superior to that of man and one in the face of which we with our modest Powers must feel humble in this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive
 I hope this answers your question best wishes yours Albert Einstein it doesn't think that she wrote in the letter that might have indicated
 you know her ability to grasp this but here he's saying you know if you look carefully at something this is what Saint Ignatius was doing right if you look carefully something you should feel a spirit manifest
 that is vastly superior to man that is created this herb
that is healing his body that both have designed so complex that we can't even understand it but it's masterful right and end so you go out into that gardening and you don't have one other nugget too tight to this
 and this this connect to I think I don't know whose last week or the week before a couple weeks ago some didn't we we had a nugget that had to do with how we got all these things in the speeding everything up oh yeah we did that another where we we Analyze That Tik Tok video and was saying back in the way that we grew up like in the seventies we didn't have all these things that are like we are faster and yeah it's so how it affects one's patience and how when you're facts and how when your patience gets affected then you're just to satisfy your mind is always disturb so this is from summoning made certain I have no idea who she is
 but it's about gardening
and she says everything that slows us down
 and force is patience
 everything that sets us back into slow cycles of nature is a help gardening is an instrument of Grace but that's interesting to read cuz like you know back you know no matter what Adrian you know we have to wait for that to you you plant the seed and and you tend to it and you have to wait there or something for it to grow you know and it's like riding a bicycle. My bike around my bike on a regular route that I would drive you just take things slower you notice things more and in course there was a time before bicycles where people just walked and the same road you walk down every day or drive down every day now becomes a whole different Road when you walk and definitely definitely slows things down when I want to hear about these pilgrimage is that happened three hundred years ago or five hundred years
do in Indiana are going to walk to jog enough pori from Bengal like we forget that store the other day or so the story goes she been on the same yeah what what what a whole different trip that is been flying into the blue baneshwar airport getting picked up by a bus in an hour and an hour but will be in jagannath Puri it's just walking to this play at your building anticipation the entire like that time I went to I went to tirupati that's what happened.
 It was it was nice to arrange for me by our friend radical inform you that I was traveling to tirupati he got in touch with the temple there they set me up it was great and the Shortline right not that okay
 but they said they would get they would send someone to go with me the next day
to go have darshan of biology which is like on this hill with a 3500 more than 3,500 steps to get to the door Hills or Hills but you don't have to wait until you got to climb that and it's very beautiful and then you wait in line for a long time and yes you know what large part of the reason why they're sending that person with me because there's some technicalities to getting in the line and and so on and it would help me do that and it involves the passport and all its understand that person to assist me as it all wow how thoughtful and nice you know so then then when I met the person the early the next morning and with the break of dawn and ready to go up that hill and then I've heard about in this Temple is like the most famous popular Ancient Temple and you know of Lord goes back you know
all the great Saints have gone there a few of the century and so
 so I said okay I'm ready to go sit okay we'll work with what we get we got a car ready we'll drive on up you drove up the hill so I said no no no I really wanted to walk and I'll climb up the hill
 I don't know probably you don't want to do that put up with anybody difficult for many many steps and that's exactly what I want to do and he kept insisting that that would you don't want to do that and you know like you just going to waste your time you're wearing yourself out you know it's this is a much better way to go you know I think he didn't want to do that you know and so he's convinced me that I but is exactly what I want to do so I realized I was kind of stuck
 because you know it's the graciousness of the devotees to provide this person to assist me and door and so I I just
the kind of cave and did what he wanted to do and and then what and then while you're waiting in that line you know it's like it's ours and you're kind of scrunched you know yeah and but even that as you were saying it's like it's building your anticipation and and and you're surrounded by
 every single in your area is something that has the potential to stimulate you know the kind of mood that you want to go when you actually have that moment adarsh how many had that moment before addition and he started inquiring from Beyond different topics
 I'd like controversial political kind of topics if you don't want to talk about like and yeah and so I was just trying to change the subject or void it or just kind of like subtly show my disinterest in that topic and then and then if any just wasn't picking up he was trying to call you on a regular basis
TV at you for Krishna Consciousness isn't picking up on my on my signal and so then I just said you don't respect what I said do you know honestly I just prefer not to discuss these things don't get angry with me he told me when it came I had the darshan and then I walked down the hill and I said I walked on the hell alone you know I just want to spend this time I must have I walked out alone and when I got to the bottom of the temple a bump in the temple
 the discontent of the bottom of the hill I bumped into an old friend of mine. Bondo who I hadn't seen a 9 years somehow you know he happened to be there right at that time then so we decided tomorrow will walk up the hill together and so we did that and that's what we want to do wanted to climb those 34 you wanted the austerity we wanted to the Simplicity we were
wanted the extended time to wanted to slow it down so that our minds could be in the right state in a right state for for the right devotional mood and also I think what's being said here through these through these ideas that were exploring this morning
 slow down so that we can see all the evidence
 to help us understand reality that we've just zoomed past or zoom over you don't like sometimes these these these atheistic scientists still say there's no evidence forgot evidence is everywhere it's a question of how you're going to process it up it's kind of like you know if there's a if there's a if there's a bank a bank robbery
 and or another robbery where there's a safe involved
 and we see that the safe was opened like the door
was opened in what to speak of there's evidence that return quickly right like within a short amount of time that Savers open quickly then that's evidence
 that's someone that knew the combination was involved in this now it doesn't prove who did it is not even exactly proof
 that it was an inside job but his evidence that there was and you start to add up the different pieces of evidence and it gets to the point where it's beyond A Reasonable Doubt sure and so did just look at every took two to do like Saint Ignatius was and look at the leaf and look at the worm and look at look at the herb and look at the plan look at the tree and look at everything else that we're seeing in life and end in science is just showing us that she's far more intricate and far more complex in far more well-designed and we could even imagine just with our blood senses to see it all and say there's no evidence know if you say that it already I know that
you're compromised if you say there's a lot of evidence but we don't quite know what to make of it or there's not a lot there's a lot of evidence but I don't believe that it proves okay maybe there's some level of subjectivity their objectivity but did you say there's no evidence of God already I know that that that that you're you've been compromised by something within you be a real you really have to stick your head in the sand and yeah you come to that conclusion by the way I also had one of my first pilgrimage is I took people on a long time ago I took them to Balaji also and we did the steps we walk the steps but when we got to the top right I couldn't put us in the fast lane there's like a VIP line which only takes like an hour to see have darshan up and then there was the 8-hour line so I was like oh my God we're skipping to the fast line and if you're unfamiliar with this it's almost like going through TSA PreCheck or something or the lines and security where you're going or Disneyland are you going back in
the back and forth and back and forth in these zig-zag lines take out to the front so it goes on for hours but I was like wow this is great we're in the Short Line and because it was a short line or sort of like not also not focus and we actually did go in front of the deity we weren't even like looking we are just a moment to actually have darshan the line is so long and they did she write out
 as soon as you start saying see the Lord God started looking around and then and he said we got to have darshan apology and I guess what we got in the Short Line and always take us 1 hour and he goes oh
 I actually like the long line as a y goes the building
the anticipation to sign the word is so important
 nice same thing walking you know when people used to do Char dham Char dham yatra and go to Bhajan out kid or not the moon or three good-looking go to the walking off the Himalaya and I know a lot of people still you can find people to still do this there are walking trails to do you know how long that would take that far its width when you're in a car you have to come down to these Forks in the road to go back up there are ways to go from think he could do good in a light a half-truth maybe a tarp and people that know that do that do walk you know they walk from your supposed to start it hard to our butt
 enough to get a car ride up a little bit okay so any case
that everywhere this is what pilate was doing
 her any costume like where is your god that's what we're going to get to the heavy stuff tomorrow gonna hurt any kind of person where is your god out and I'll leave okay Rena cash a applied before he said and she might buy what time which is every means of Conquest when should offer respectful of base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan internado Ryan Ricci the super most human being a mother sarswati the goddess of learning industrial yesterday the author not stopped right by regular tennis in classes in the bag with Tom and Byron Reece service to the pure devotees all that is troublesome the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise with transcendental
we establish as in a revocable fact oh my God
 was born the darkness of ignorance my teacher to opening my eyes at the door side of knowledge I offer my obeisance he's at their Lotus feet are you look straight at the at the screen to the great because before you always like this
 that's the way I am anyway with or without a camera and now you're like you're looking right at 7:11 so yeah it's about to reply to his little boy
 he's angry too I know sometimes little kids can say things I can just like their schooling you like they are right
yeah it was telling him you haven't conquered your enemies what you talk about him and Conquer my enemies out, toes for like years and years and years you who is this little kid to tell me anything like this is angry
 Renny koshy pool replied you rascal you are trying to minimize my tell you and no one likes that when we're in our food if no one likes our value to be minimized as if you were better than me at controlling the senses this is over intelligent I can therefore understand that you desire to die at my hands for this kind of nonsensical talk is indulged by those who are about to die he chops down the ego and what do you want to do you want to kill him yeah
 Hugo
a most unfortunate prahlad you have always described a Supreme Being other than me a Supreme Being who is above everything who is the controller above everyone who is all-pervading
 but where is he
 if he is everywhere then why is he not present before me in this pillar people say that all the time if there's a God why doesn't he get up and do a little dance for me so we can argument is that there is a dance Just the Dance of the nature tornado
 I have not in person I've only seen me neither but they're actually quite beautiful as destructive as they are I struck tab natural Forest but it's like sacred geometry with big fitment Fibonacci spiral
spiral
 okay being obsessed with anger honey cuz you poo who is very great and bodily strength dust chastised is exalted devotees son
 I'm sorry because you were speaking so much nonsense I shall now sever your head from your body now let me see your most worship will God come to protect you
 I want to see it
 being obsessed with anger hernia cause you poo who is very great and bodily strength does chastise his exalted devotees son a lot with harsh words cursing him again and again for any cash to put check out his sword got up from his Royal throne and with great anger struck his fist against the column
 Ben from within the pillar
 I'm a fearful sound
which appeared to crack the covering of the universe oh my dear you just hear this sound reach even the abodes of the demigods like Lord Brahma and when the demigods heard it they thought oh now are planets are being destroyed while showing his extraordinary prowess or any cuz you poop we just hired to kill his own son her that wonderful tumultuous sound which had never been heard upon hearing the sound the other leaders of the Demons were afraid
 none of them could find the origin of that sound in the assembly
 to prove that a statement of a servant provide Mirage with substantial in other words to prove that the Supreme Lord Harry is present everywhere even within the pillar of an assembly hall the Supreme for it's not a God hurry wonderful form never before seen the form was neither that of a man nor that of a lion that's the Lord appeared
is wonderful form in the Assembly Hall okay wonderful from Abu to rupam there are
 the way that that the sages explain Krishna and all the avatars is that from from Krishna and this is founded by what time Rite Aid take chunks of clapping sir Christmas to buy the bonds family list all these different avatars and then it says but all of these
 are all coming from sweet little baby Krishna ride then there was all, there's one source for the mall is One Source from which they all Spring right in that is the full form of Krishna did the two-handed beautiful lovely flute playing boy surrounded by a double bogeys approaching shovel approachable and loving and dumb and very beautiful and
I'm like way then he expands into different experiences and from them come different avatars of all different varieties there's a Lila avatars that you know they're playing right now is a little after he takes joy in becoming angry to protect his beloved is it is it is Lila it's his pastime Lord ROM that's a Lila Avatar or he comes to you know conquer over Robin and to rescue Sita you know that's it's exciting and satisfying for him to
 become fully absorbed in that Adventure avatars and then there's going to Ava tars you know who are these has more in charge of the material realm in the different modes of nature you know someone has to govern that you know there is purusha avatars
and there's all these different types of Avatar you got mattars
 but amongst them all and end you know there's a book that I think for a lot of people at a certain until a certain point this book might see this logo bag of a Time rated by rubika Swami it can seem kind of like a book it's an analysis of all these different avatars and how do understand cuz there's so many piranhas in so many you need so many texts how do you make sense of them all and categorize them he's he's done that here he's he's done the research and laid it out of how do understand Christian all the pictures different avatars and sauce so for someone with us an interest in this you know like a well-developed interesting it's like always answering all my questions for someone that's kind of new toys like it's just it's the overwhelming yeah but there's a there's a mention here
about machine days and it's something that I don't fully understand
 but it says
 he's describing different avatars and then so the rumor goes to his right and says now for the power of us the forms part of Us 2
 from what I believe pot in a part of me is higher in a bus. I think just mean situated so I think literally part of us should just be situated high or like these are categorized as higher so now the power of us to forms according to the Padma purana you know he's gone and done this research nursing her Furnishing a day that I'm out now ramachandra and Krishna are complete in all six qualities
 they are part of us two forms of the Supreme Lord like lamps lit from another lamp so for some reason this form
 I'm missing a day I am hearing why because
full of the six qualities right we should ice ice only speaking the qualities that we refer to when we say pahlavan Marin Osos all six
 she comes yeah but you always forget 123 intelligence
 Beauty and
 she's always wanted strength okay so somehow this form amongst all these different there's Krishna which is the original form there's a rama
 and then there's your see my day that this particular for his son
very special son of very manifesting opulence is beyond that of even so many powerful and fastening avatars this form of Krishna as the half man half lion you know is especially worshipped and especially is especially dear and especially fascinating especially especially especially amongst all the avatars and he's about to bust out in this program beer. You don't like this this is a manifestation of
 ferocious
 anger
 the Ferocious anger pure love if if if if if there's an anger that manifest when your beloved is threatened
 this is the most condensed and Powerful
Devastation of that love
 that burst out of this pillar and fruit for all the centuries coming down in a millennia
 the the Christmas boxes that the walkie talkies
 they hold this form as very special and very dear
 yes I'm a manifestation of God's anger when the devotees are being persecuted
 I think in the last we have this idea of God is angry if I if I'm misstep God is angry if I send God is angry if I don't live up to my Highest Potential and that's not it that's not it we cut we caused our own Karma by our bad choices God is Not punishing you your your own bad choices are punishing you but there is an expression of God's eye
your net comes when the devotees are being persecuted because the devotees are dear to him and doesn't like to see just like a father doesn't like to see the children takes it personally take it personally and kept on getting pushed and pushed and pushing okay now you now you're going to see something magnificent yes he is in that pillar yes he is in the yes he's in the in the beautiful designs of the sand when the waves come in he's in the beautiful veins of the leaves he's in the beautiful circular lines of a piece of wood that sod right down the middle and then can see all the was it called in the Rings Rings rings but he's also actually manifest in full as well when he's when he desires to manifest will hear a description of
form now and it's fascinating you know what show Christmas writing on the the chat board demons get the claw devotees get the par-3 tries to say that say that he's like like a mother lying like a mother lines very protective of the Cubs and you know she said D on the mouth of that mother lion the teeth that line are terrifying or anyone that's mystery in the Cubs you know they got those drawers for the cob the Sperry same mouth a very same job as if they can we pick you up from the nape of the neck and lovingly movie from here to there and you know it's it's so that ferocity it's it's yours my ferocious side and here's my loving side and if you threaten my loving side cuz Krishna is the god of love then he manifests his ferocious form
and that's his Lila too because there's some taste and protecting the one you love right there some flavor there that he wants to taste and he's tasting it in this form
 Loretta
 I just looked all around to find the source of the sound at wonderful form of the lord we could not be ascertained to be either man or a lion emerge from the pillar in amazement trying to catch tapu wondered is this creature that is half man and half lion
 shoosh and said this is the first if we go back remember that long before this here anytime she poo wanting power really what he was looking for was
immortality
 he performed severe austerities
 and on the basis of those are serious he was granted benedictions from Lord ra ma he wanted he asked for immortality and I have a very long lifetime but even I don't have the mortality
 so you can have to ask me for something else and then he tried to Conakry loopholes where to get immortality without actually getting it so he said you know I don't want to be killed by I want to be I want to be unable to be killed by man or animal granted that was a clerk said there's a whole list of it right but this is the first the first condition condition that that that the Lord found a loophole around okay you manifested informed that wasn't man in wasn't animals half man half a man animal animal animal
already got you could study the form of the Lord trying to decide you know is interesting this is this is how every demon goes down there living in there you go there if you ever watch a yeah
 you know like a mafia movie you know like these guys think you're undefeatable or no one can take me down then all of a sudden someone they all go to the other the other family comes and shoots them down there like in this is how sometimes you see what they like MMA MMA fighters who live in their ego some of them live in their ego and when they go down like what must be like to go down and your hole is not just like you going down going down and right when you are near the illusion that you were infallible and then it just like crushes you
 Twilight idea Behind the Music documentaries or the Behind the Music documentary.
