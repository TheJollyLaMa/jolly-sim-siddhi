 as my mom would say this could be the end of the world it's one of her famous quotes
 do you know it just goes on and on. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to have one of those where they call it you know that thing that the drug deals are on a run around and do some service never never quite satisfied with it
I got Anna maybe that's a good thing yeah I don't know if you are supposed to be like
 I've done it all I've done everything I had a weird thing yesterday I was in and out of urgent care and weird heart palpitations look closer at Mexico sunrise and weird heart palpitations and I know you're little like 30 minutes and it was very weird for like the last 3 days I've been really out of it and I went to the Urgent Care am I and my insurance lapsed horrible with so I went to Urgent Care because it's like a $5,000 bill is it ridiculously in America to go to the emergency room and I thought I'd be respond I put it off as much as I could
 and then there is like just go to urgent care and the whole day off yesterday cuz you're feeling I thought it off yesterday to see well maybe I'll be able to tell me what tell me what was happening
I had 30 minutes of weird heart palpitations that's got to be very uncomfortable as like weird is happening with my body
 Play Never Had it felt like that before and then I then I went to Urgent Care and I had my EKG done in India at the Box about the hospital and I will always wondered I was like it's like a real hospital hospital it doesn't look like a big American Hospital but when I show them all my reports they're like this is incredible what they've given you is incredible they were very impressed with how it was going to lay it out at me to put down that hospital at all but sometimes like American hospitals are just things in America just a little shiny or a little bigger a little Bolder but they're very impressed
and they saw my EKGs from January when I went to get my physical
 and then they showed my EKG and they're like the doctor was like something's very wrong here something's very wrong I don't like I don't like this at all okay Mara look at me like she didn't say that then it starts palpitating like Fort Worth
 she was so happy with the way they did the reports you like this is incredible about how they did a report that the Indian at the hospital but I thought you was going to come back with good news I call you like those great she's like yeah and it's really I don't like what I see I was like okay I thought you were in a good mood swings back and forth she's easily pleased and he's like I said so then I had to go to a home now
urgent care for cardio things I wanted to send him to the ER anyway to make a long story short I spent my entire day in these type of like that are.
 Eat a lot of realization when you're in this helpless position so I can I get it it's by everything that is true in the second and then I have a bunch of dreams and pokes I have plans to go to California with the stupid Mara and and I started thinking you know what Krishna
 I guess I feel good about my life but my kids are too young not to have a father but who am I so arrogant to think that these are all the thoughts going through my mind my so arrogant to think that your day care for them I won't care for them somehow or Krishna has it they need you to after while
nothing to even pray for except pray for my children's connection pray for my friends
 feel like you're fine get up my world I did realize is I couldn't yesterday I just couldn't chant my rounds my conch I did do my Puja right before I left
 it said it right after the show or something is it because of me tell me the truth my point is this when you're not feeling well it's really easy to it it's really difficult to do are prescribed spiritual practice to Champion Opera to read to do your regular it's almost at the end of the day I was like you know what
 week I got to take my
virtual life seriously while I'm healthy because when I'm sickly which comes all you got to do is walk through one of those hospitals and see all the sickly people when I get to that stage I will be able to do anything except like listen to some Puritans
 so maybe I'll work out range this just for this realization yeah yeah just for some realization about that I think that's important

 attending our world and I see you know you because you're not in your normal situation with your whole computer and Screen instead of you probably not realize you're getting all kinds of Love on the chat for today oh yeah my lover's is concerned thank you
alright alright got a nugget
 all right in the Nugget is by Pope Francis Francis live but really I saw Obama live Francis is everybody's favorite either I mean I don't know nice really sad about religion politics okay
 but here's Pope Francis is quote let's see if we like what he says there are Saints of everyday the hidden Saints to which we can all be long as we can all be one of these are going to well
maybe Pope Francis has to be reminded that to actually be a saint according to Wikipedia to Miracles he need to perform to miracles
 hidden Miracle sale
 truly I think when these people when you have people that are really like givers in this world and they're sort of like not flamboyant they're loud about it what they're doing it is a private thing
 and they've actually transform their consciousness
 transform their life that is very saintly and that is almost miraculous the fact that we can work against the way we were trained we've all been trained to behave and act I actually I think a lot of people are coming to this show
 are people who are saying you know what the caterpillar it's time to become a butterfly we're actually going against the current of War
call Cheryl our family or what how we're wired to be to become someone better and so I think
 all you Zoomers out there you're hitting Saints perhaps you know what this reminds me of Hannah Avatar I've shared before on the show but you remember this book by Tolstoy that that I've read before spoken about before father sergius
 oh yeah have you read that I didn't read it I think you would really like my audible last book
 but I won't tell the whole story but it talks about this very very insightful writing about a man who kind of you know until stories time in his error
Russia and how he
 turns his back on high society
 becomes a priest
 disgusted with them you know the whole material game social games and all that but then
 when he gets into that church he finds there's a lot of the same kind of games going on in the church and then he wants to leave it behind and he manages to get permission to just kind of like as a Hermit and as a Hermit he starts to get deeper realization so you know
 so so deep that he's people are starting to recognize him as a saint and he even starts to get like powers like he could heal people and stuff like that now nice perk.
and so and in his reputation just keeps growing and growing and growing
 but then but he keep ask his reputation is growing he's actually feeling more more hollow inside like I'm not what they believe I am I think as his Fame grows his Focus begins to
 fade you know his the depth of his spiritual Focus sure if you can still pay it and then he has like a kind of a fall down no spiritual fall down
 having him down and then he just that that it was that incident that just made him realize I'm just I'm just at this is just a facade you know everyone thinks I'm a big say but I'm really not
 and then he just began to live like a Wandering beggar
 really destitute you know but but destitute and kind of destitute not only like materially but spiritually destitute in the sense that he feel
like my life has been a waste I've you know I've just been playing this game all along I was thinking the others are playing the game in the church and Society but I was as well sure and then he has his dream
 he was feeling so destitute and Just one thought kept coming to his mind and
 and it was a thought of his when he was a boy that he had this cousin a girl and she was just like almost pitiful like just very shy and and
 shy and dumb
 like I don't know what the right word to use his butt
 do you like pitiful in a sense you know everyone would tease her he would tease her even Steven he would feel just looking at her face even her face with that kind of brought up feelings of like all poor girl you know and and even he would feel some shame and in teasing her
but you thought of her and how innocence good-natured she was sure and then he had a dream and in the dream he was instructed go find her and it was Pechanga
 and he has his dream it says go to Pechanga and learn from her what you have to do and what you're seeing is and wherein lies your salvation and so he he seeks her out and she's just like she's like a a grandmother Widow with with her children and grandchildren she's a struggle until I pay the bills and living in this tiny little house and she's but the way that toast with Paints the picture of her just with his details as you can see she's very very saintly inside you know nobody recognizes that even you know she's kind of like just living a life of selflessness that's going on recognized and he comes in and he
he needs her they sit down and she shocked to see him
 and he begins to ask her about her life and she speaking about her own life in such a way that's like with humility like really feel like my life is so unimportant look at how ridiculous poor I am and you knowing and he starts to ask her questions like would you go to church
 she goes how I am but I'm so bad I don't go to church and all but why not oh well I just kind of embarrassed even go I don't have any good clothes I got to let you know and I'll let you know I think I'll embarrass my family if I got it and it is compared to pray and she says oh yes I pray all the time but the my prayer is so insincere you know it's like it and and she says that he's like yes yes like yes in a sense that when I was in the church we're all pretending we're praying so well this woman is praying so well
feels like she's not and it's it's in the character of her that he actually saw that you sent me to send and there's this one little part I want to read work when you finally guess it only says
 this is so so that is what my dream meant the dream that to go seek her out Pechanga is what I ought to have been but failed to be I lived for men but like living for the respective man at Prestige know I live for men on the pretext of living for God while she live for God imagining that she lives for men
 yes one good deed a cup of water given without a thought of reward is worth more than any benefit I imagined I was bestowing on people
 but after all was there not some share of sincere desire to serve God he asked himself and the answer was yes there was but it was all swelled and overgrown
why desire for human praise yes there is no God for the man who lives as I did for human praise I will seek him now
 yeah it's it's it's it's I think it's a really nice illustration that he writes so well and really goes deep into the church and the
 the Dynamics that can take place within a so-called spiritual or religious Institution
 and then what is really the essence and where do we find it and I think a lot of times it's in Hidden Saints you know if we have to we have to recognize that look for it preciate it
 I like how you're pointing out this idea that
 we can join a spiritual institution is force of community and still get caught up in all the sort of the high school politics or such a community yeah and it becomes sort of like a Gathering Place becomes very social
 I need a
play sometimes because I used to go to I got we we live in the ashram but then there be a Sunday fees with the community comes
 and I can even reflect living in the ashram going I don't feel that spiritual necessarily during a Sunday Feast I feel like I'm trying to just like enjoy the material world within a community have deep spiritual emotions can be like that where you're sort of like in a party mood and I think and everybody spiritual path they might go back and forth between these two places like I need Community I get something from the community and then I need to retreat and go a little deeper I think the community is good till like Bowie people in a certain way but there has to be personal work the current of the community can help you but it can't like say it could be potentially could stifle your reflection
for sure for sure and I've seen so many great Souls step away
 sometimes come back step away come back and play that game again and again I think in my own life sort of been that as well too but once I stop that deep spiritual in introspection especially in my own life I have a tendency to just get into
 so like a high school mentality of
 you know what school was fun different cliques and stuff like School traumatic for you I'm going to take you to go to high school Eastwood Heights knock out the back door wouldn't the Lower East Side pinky nail lacquer
hello big as long I think I think you just forgot the cliff that one last time around and it didn't help of growth going on
 right all right let's get into this here you go you know we're going to find out about another hidden Saint in today's reading connected the dots I was like oh I know where he's going on man carrying the the religious symbols of a holy man even of a renunciate write up a staff and the coming down through the beggar's Bowl
 he's actually quite Stout me as a Hermit and his he's quite Stout I'll help you as a Herrera just laughed at me what you enjoy each other's company your social person right now
see myself being like a know what enough of this hermit time swing the pendulum to the other side okay text him
 what about the mattress coming first grind on the mosquito bite with time with several music Conquest what you'll offer respectful of Mason City is to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Ricci the super most human being and some other saraswathi the goddess of learning at the house today the author last appraised for botheration the chum bucket in the back rent during service to the pier to mod all that is troublesome to become erratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praise the transmittal Psalms be established as an Arab a cool fact.
shaggin on Genesis College I offer obeisance he's after Lotus feet reading for the shoot and I'm jammed in a car to do this podcast I'm holding a mic cuz I can't put on a table and they're my painting is pretty girl sticking up in the pinky is going right to the camera and the ice is gigantic as if I play classical guitar like you just crawled out of a grave after being in there for 20 years I heard that the nails still grow after the bottom drawer that's the point or like a little monkeys and burned out and they got like that too long nails
security guard the sinkhole Pantoja right now I'll hide it and hide it is hideous
 that's how I got it make the pinky nail if I'm now yeah I realize the next 10 me not expose himself to the vision of human society
 right by his behavior his purpose is disclosed right sure to Human Society he should present himself like a Restless child
 I should recognize doing man interesting not the first time in bobtown we've come across this
deeply realize Yogi that's pretending that he's just like a dumb person cuz he doesn't want to get caught up in the materialistic
 circles and vibrations in all of that I think the first time I heard devotees speak in a deeply humble way it was so shocking
 like wow they're not trying to play the game of let me impress you like the if anything they were you know speaking lowly of themselves not presenting themselves as an authority not presenting themselves as you're trying to impress me and I was so impressed of the way the eagle usually works and that's one of the qualities about devotees that we fall in love with is there the softness and their humility is exactly were talking about yesterday about you know
political debates were you trying to rush the person you're debating it's not like that devotees don't Crush by force they don't they're not trying to crush they're trying to like
 they're trying to connect with the soul and were inspired and impressed and want to be like them
 I tell ya what we got to be devotees we got to act like devotees cuz that's the attractive bit more than the books is how we behave you know we're going to swing I think of like a do you take a text like she Tony Chargin Rita which is one one of the the wonderful things about that book at this it's not just you know what the 17 volume it's a large work
 essential work in our lineage
 work that covers the life
 as well as the present the philosophy of shoe to Tanya the refined violation of a philosophy but you also its it take that it's Saturday
is within the Society of Bucky Oggi's within the Society of the Bison of us and so you get to learn about them how they relate to one another one another through different personalities of the different roles that they play so you it's kind of like a sort of sociological kind of
 yeah look into vaishnava society right this is how they behave this is how they talk to each other this is how they another This Is How They present themselves in different in different different different Yogi's present themselves in different ways in the book end but it occurs to me in there so many important so sheets that we learn of Catania who are seen to us has different role models and put the ones that get the most coverage
 nnn whether there's also the chance on your blog about you know
another work of similar nature
 is the ones with the deepest humility seem to be like there special that there's a lot like for assessing the heart attack or has that whole chapters just devoted to him right now and he was this person that had this uniquely deep you know so so humble that he wouldn't he was he was always kind of in the background always going to do you like himself qualify to say I lived in a cave deeply spiritual deeply led by example and he was considered the highest Holy Name there's a lot of coverage on a cultivator sridhar
 who is who is like a beggar who has nothing his financial net worth is zero at yeah it's so it it was Gloria
find his poverty not just his properties glorifying his attitude amongst being impoverished you're the humility to get it you don't have to have anything to be number one yeah right we're trying to get number one by what we accumulate he's number one by his behavior by his gentleness by his soft Heart by his Devotion to Mother Ganga
 and I'm so perhaps the reason why we get it extra coverage on those is because this is what we really need to imbibe ourselves we might want to we might look at the greater Chara's and say oh that's what I meant to be and I like that's my destination to be respected by everyone is the grade saying not to take a look at these other characters you know who are the you know they're they're they're hidden more culture now today is a very powerful current telling us what's how to be number one and has a lot to do with those I'm getting older am I getting back
am I getting an extra 10 um I fit do I have a gut do I have a butt how are my legs how is a camera angles do I have eyes with her my eyelashes how is my bank balance what do I drive and where do I live what part of town do I live in this is the metric to us to feel like now you have some work and it's not a real worth anyway it's just it it it it it says it's incredibly shallow type of work that's first of all temporary and second of all doesn't necessarily make you a great person it just means you have nice eyebrows eyelashes Babs what that's all a big deal and so they're almost like people are also concerned about their nails to how you do your nails also and so it recalibrates what we consider be a win in culture and their
she told me try to reach especially with all these literature say our Behavior to others are behaviors to our sell our focus on the Supreme personality how we live our life how we allocate our life and all the stuff of this world is really really secondary it's almost a most have to say this every day because the Maya is so strong
 so we're got to meet this character here
 text 11s historical example of this learning sages recite the story of an ancient discussion between prolonged Mirage and a great the saintly person who was feeding himself like a python what does it mean to feed myself like a python
 well the python is not Super Active they just
hey there when something comes by
 wrap themselves around that thing that's so they're not on the hunt they just make sure that what comes to them except what comes to them in the eat you know there's a big Burmese pythons issue going on in Florida you know that right
 I'm sorry there's a python issue in Florida like you was not at all pets in the perfect breeding ground for pythons some people like the highway to run over and make the kill all natural taking over the East Coast. It's almost like an invasive species today is Youmans
 I'm sure that
me like baby you're a little bit go for like raccoons and go for like they go for like they do bobcats
 rabbits deer
 there's a huge yeah it's no big deal anyway but that has nothing to do with or talk in person is living like a python okay with her question is how we get the news here for those who would listen was with sages and regular basis in December 2021 the heaviest Burmese python was caught in Florida weighing in at 215 pounds is a human being would like 100 lb human the longest one is 19 ft long
 yeah
people that hunt them actually in Florida out of control by the way why were just a little bit he did leave a message for you regarding your heart cuz you're ugly I'm going to say if you live or die
 you be happy
 if you live you'll be happy and if you die while thinking of Krishna then you go back to God heading to steal butter with y'all the Tractive Lord SRI Krishna
 thank you. Our ten-year-old from Lebanon sitting there daydreaming about my death thank you for dinner either way I'll be happy
 alright let's hear about the python man so there's an old story there's an old store that provide Mirage spoke about relied Maharaj the most dire servitor this every person of the godhead once went out
touring the universe with some of this picture of a dental associates
 send me a confidential associate with them in confidence okay that means like your your your besties people that you open up to the universe was some of this some of his best he's just to study the nature of stately people what a nice mission right yeah what's go around check out seeing the people that she arrived at the bank of the kaveri river that's one of the Holy rivers in India where there was a mountain known as Sia
 there he found a great Stanley person who is lying on the ground covered with dirt and dust but who was deeply spiritually Advanced so he just looks like some lazy guideline
brown right you think like who's this guy would just we call 911 and there is sense this was a special person
 neither by the saintly persons activities by his bodily features
 by his words nor by the symptoms of his Varn ashram status could people understand whether he was the same person they had known so he apparently like even people that might have known him before
 he just was different now
 is lying on the ground this is a thing people just get a spiritual calling and they just
 they go off on their own profit share this in the counter he said a highly Advanced version of a Harley man spoke to Yogi lives in such a way that no one can.
and what he is or what he was
 then he says this is important nor should attempt be made to understand the past of a vaishnava
 he said that to the fence to try to understand the past and accept them for what they are right now
 and what they were previously really doesn't matter once you come to that place where you are
 operating as a servant of the servant of the servant of the Divine you know
 their culture doesn't do that now that's like yeah I found this on the statement by Mehran Facebook post from 2003 found out her from her yearbook high school yearbook this is what she was dressed as and we hold people to their past that's a bad way to beat don't hold yourself to their past and don't hold the other people to the Past see them for how they be
in the present we want people to see us that way we have a hard time lowest incarnation of myself
 Carmen understand that the python Man story was on the lyric sheet for the Quest for certain the album when it first came out is that true or other he's asking if that's what he thinks he's not sure apparently we did do something with the python man I can't remember though anyway
 the best of the band stability play Mirage de lis worshipped in an offer to Basin to use to the saintly person who had adopted a pythons means of livelihood does it after this worshipping the saintly person and touching his head down to the Saints ft Lotus feet a lot Mirage in order to understand him inquired very submissively as follows
seen the saintly person to be quite fat a lot more said Dear Sir you undergo no Endeavor to earn your livelihood but you do have a stout body exactly like that of a materialistic enjoy our
 I know that if one is very rich and has nothing to do here becomes extremely fat by eating and sleeping and Performing no work its prolonged Mirage fat shaming here when I think that there is sometimes use that word fat differently right but it's give me like Stout I think they were but I don't think he's shamming at all I think he's just trying to put it together you don't work and yet apparently you're well fed and well fed what's what's going on here
 Mo brahmana bully in knowledge of transcendence you have nothing to do and therefore you're a lying down it is also understood that you have no money for sense enjoyment
how does your body become so fat why do you keep talking about me but feeling fine about myself
 if you do not consider my question imputed, explain how this happened interesting that he referred to him as a barometer although he has no external symbols of it well I have some insight
 that's what I'm thinking because actually the python man is going to speak to that when he starts this week we'll see you continues your honor appears limited experts and intelligent in every way
 you can speak very well saying things that are pleasing to your heart to the heart you see that people in general are engaged in fruit of activities that you are lying here in active to prolonged saying everybody else is
how to find happiness by working hard to try to get the money to get the external things to make them happy and you seem like you're totally satisfied just lying here on the ground interesting it is really a most people are walking right by I'm saying who is this slop guys lying around to provide had side he's on to something and it's amazing how hard we work just for the basics of life isn't it oh yeah
 I was in apartment on this on the show right now so make a reference department on it I was at I remember working in LA and I was like
 I was working so hard I was ready to kill myself I was teaching like 8 Yoga classes a day and I had a huge mortgage I couldn't afford and I had for little kids and I was like losing my marbles in LA traffic like literally I've probably
the healthiest I've ever eaten in my life and my yet my body was just breaking down and if she exhaustion and then I talked to Carmen under the phone and he was like sort of like living a simple life his kids were going to The Inn at the Waldorf School and they're surrounded by the countryside and the cost is living with love and I S am I some jackass jackass just working my butt off and there's pirate on descendants get to the Waldorf School lying around like a python but the exhaustion I was working I was like why am I doing this I have no you know the quality of life is so low
 or what sometimes we have to ask ourselves before we get so busy why am I going to get busy why can't I just simplify certain things and I think it's important to all over the car
check the map what is my direction what where is the finish line here how much is enough you know and
 I think that's a big part of our spiritual path to is sometimes we say you know what no more or sometimes we say I'm going to go live in this place anymore. Going to keep doing this I'm not going to work for this guy anymore I'm going to eat there there's other options for me my mental my sanity and my sanity my peace of mind my family
 is well worth it
 hey go thank you lessons from the python man
 you know I just love this idea of
 a lot going on this tour to innocence to find the hidden sense you know
 yeah can you think of a hidden Saint in your life
 Mara is my head and Saints nightmare
you know how I am with the person that there's so many I could think of you don't like people that I know that the really deep talk to you all these but they're not so recognizes that you know my my friend soccer ball might you know I just wrote me a letter yeah he did he is saintly that guy he's very Advanced you know he walks around and maybe the whole Community just kind of season is a kind of ordinary and everything but like he's not at work now him he's not ordinary know a person keeps to themselves you do me a lot of saints within the Hare Krishna be really do that especially if you look for it like they might not be passed off as I like a liter or a roar Guru or something like that but they're hidden in their community
yeah
 our man on the says mother collini she was very same and she was like that without all right I think we're at a time or not that one quick I felt like was more to say there's more of this Saturday tomorrow okay
 I want you to think of their I think I want to think of their hidden Saint in their life today and maybe appreciate them
