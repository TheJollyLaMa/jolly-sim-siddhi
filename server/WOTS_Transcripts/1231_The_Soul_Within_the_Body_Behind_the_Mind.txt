 wow he's like he's just empowering everything to go forward and he's got a powerful Vision like I just want to get caught up in his current he's really encouraging us and wisdom of the sages I'm really excited to see how all this stuff expands and yeah his his vision for the Golden Eagle built just one of his many projects and it is so tremendous and it started off with nothing it started off with a big Baron Stonyfield and then he would tell us we're going to have to go over downhill over here we're going to have a burned oven for
here and nobody can make heads or tails of it then he's like we're going to make an exact replica of the Madan Mohan temple in Sandstone on this property no one got it and sure enough January 1st through their 22,000 people were there and it's become like it's is created a holy place and people come from all over the world and I will say it's the most peaceful and organized place and clean place and all of India in Lush beautiful quiet and puppy on that
 all of this are all of the the beautiful spiritual Aesthetics are combined with a very powerful effective Dynamic presentation of how we can live more in harmony with nature so it's got a very powerful Eco element to it that's changing you.
you don't potentially little projects like this eventually can change the world what we can say for sure is the 70 Villages around this Village are very directly and dynamically do you know feeling the effects of this place for sure.
 I hear you you hear me okay
 well maybe you need to turn up your mic a little baby my mic is louder than yours
 how's the answer
 now they'll let you know maybe I might go to turn mine down is really loud that's the feedback it's the first time for her maybe that's fine
 alright we're ready to go we are ready to go we got to get out here today so the nuggets
Altamira
 oh you got something else was very sorry I was cutting things at 1 and 9:30 eastern time today. Let's say tomorrow is like a possibility but maybe it may not happen tomorrow can we may be announced at a certain point
 okay what will get the word out to you it's okay I'm also noticing that you're not the only one wearing new clothes today here it seems that Mara has or has not been shopping I got to twist your arm to get her to shop she's she's just taking care of me she's like really focusing on my birthday that's where she's very very sweet she's wearing old stuff
 it's wonderful here we go this is from
will Durant who's older and very interesting guy I did a little bit of research on him will Durant is an American historian and philosopher best known for his 11th 11 volume work called the story of civilization which contains and details the history of eastern and western civilization's seems like a really really thoughtful guy and he visited India in the thirties and he really kind of spoke out against the the the conditions that were created there in the nature of the British kind of takeover of India no really I'm really jealous of those who went to India in the old days yeah you know I just I just romanticize about it
 anyway I was going to I have tried to be impartial though I know
right now I try to be impartial do I know that a man's past always colors his views and that nothing else is so irritating as impartiality
 I'm not sure what you meant but I could you could you could take that a couple different ways right where did how did you take that
 well he says I've tried to be impartial though I know a man's past always colors as you even that right there is important right he's saying that we have a pass from from our yoga point of view you say that our past means we move through time we take in information through our eyes to our ears to our skin you know throughout, especially will be taken to her you know if your eyes and your ears
 and that in the end those Impressions passing through different layers of the Mind becomes
in the subconscious mind and therefore its various the very very rare person whose views aren't colored by that experience which makes it difficult it means to be impartial and we can talk about
 the virtue of in partiality right but to be impartial is challenging and so he's saying that's you know that it's I've tried to be impartial do I know that a man's past always called lose his views and then nothing else is so irritating isn't partiality perhaps what he means there is the challenge of it is irritating the challenge oh that's how I took it too it's like it's hard to be objective when were born a certain time space family experience emotions are tied into the experience yeah
 yeah and I think this is why I'm a reoccurring theme in bhakti teachings is
very tolerant with others that's a big one for us top strict with ourselves tell her it with everybody else that's a reoccurring theme it because if I really want to be objective I have to be tolerant I'm asked to be broad-minded it's it's and instead of like going out there and trying to change everybody I really got to work on sitting down and just first of all Justin viewing people and just seeing people as they are and before I go get pulled either way and what they're doing right what they're doing wrong for so I got to see what am I actually doing what's motivating mean am I actually am I actually living up to my own expectations of everybody else
 that's what how I came that of that that's how he's going to take away from that in a little bit I looked up the word impartial yeah and it said treating all rivals and disputants equally
 and you know whether you want to call that irritate
I suppose there is a lot of irritation doing that because internal you feel like what this person should not it should be recognized do you know the wrong that they've done me or you know it should be recognized their shortcomings compared to my own efforts and so I didn't but I think you know again from the history I think people like historians journalists although we live in but traditionally those were Fields were someone were in partiality was like really valued and it was you were trained in the university to be impartial that that's what it means to be a journalist right now it seems like you know that that's largely thrown out the door or what you spell corruption at the speed of light to be in any field of Justice right the import particularly it in quarts and it's on that look like they are specially
right at Marshall News is so important but we all feel we have arrivals or disputants are crazy Joe d'avola is in life and it's it's it's challenging to be impartial but
 I think what's if you look at this from the perspective of the oldies how they look at things they say without that you can't see truth and truth is Ultimate would set you free right and then and so therefore it becomes essential to develop pure in partiality and end really the only way to do that
 the always will say right is to see what's actually equal to see what's actually sacred to see what we all share and we're all made and what's the same in all of us and lies underneath the externals that loves lies underneath the body that lies behind the minds that with the confidence to full confidence that
did back there is a being exactly made of the exact same stuff is me just coming through a different filter and the filter may be pleasing around pleasing to me but let me let me see that being behind everything is obviously on the external level or social roles will call us to respond to different people in different circumstances in different ways but at the same time there's part of us and maybe the most essential part of us
 that's relating to that what's the same to relating to the to the spark of spirit the immutable right. That part of us that can't be contaminated that part of us that can be corrupted that's behind it all and if we can see that we can develop this this spiritual and partiality and see every living being as a brother as a sister is as a secret
 call the order it's a tall order
bhakti yoga we asked to raise the bar pretty high were asked to see a person beyond their present activities are behaving poorly were asked to see them with some great type of
 ability to be something greater and when you hold someone in their Brokenness or in there
 in their inappropriate behavior they stay there if you can deal with the person who is doing something crazy and I used the example of the the dog whose very cruel and bites in a b and they say well you know how do you how do you correct A mean dog you know the Civil the dogs been beaten so he's not good with children how do you take care of a bad dog you don't beat it more to discipline it you actually have to love that dog when you love the dog
the dog starts to change and it's a little bit more difficult than just listen dog here's the new I'm the new master and hear the new rules cuz it's very easy to hate and discipline and check and is very difficult to take a longer way around and love and that's how people change and that's what we're asked to do see something greater in a person even those who are driving you nuts and I've been having a lot of appreciation lately just being around rodness why me I was like this man has repeatedly like invested in me as I've repeatedly dropped the ball I feel and because of this I feel like he's been short of lifting me out of like this this
 in a moth like state or are this caterpillar like state to become something more beautiful like perhaps a butterfly you know they were going well I'm trying to flutter
but this is what a good teacher does a good friend does a good lover does they try to see something great in you and it when you have people like that do that for you you feel so empowered like this is very easy just to lose all faith in yourself in this material world cuz there's so many detractors he going to try to do something good there so many people taking it down we need people friends teachers that are going to say you know what I believe in you I think you got a great thing going I think you can do this and that's what makes a great friend that's what makes a great teacher it's their empowering
 that's gentleman partiality is do they deal with you with tolerance love and compassion
 thank you you're welcome thank you for tolerating loving me and compassion and because I actually slept really good that's good
annoying will always be always be there as long as you can love me help me become a butterfly costume I believe in you I actually love you I just hope I was just telling Mara today I love this guy cast
 I have a lot of appreciation for the words I say I used that's different than love all right let's do this craboo Ryan on the mosquitia Saraswati before starting the she went by with witches are very means of Conquest what should I bring back a little Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Ryan Reese you the super most human being until either starts watching the goddess of learning and she'll be off today the author non-stop reggae

 and that rendering service a pure abilities
 all his troubles in the heart with a rat a kitten and loving service of the Supreme Lord was praised which Transit at the songs will be established as in a revocable fact on Genesee LaToya Jackson was born the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet we can have any chapter for you you know what you'd rather not been having a little annoyed with rubbing off lately I've been a little upset about something right what I'm saying I've been a little upset with you about something recent
do that but yeah that's why you kept bringing me sweetie upset with everyone know I just saw a bunch of sweets and I was like it's so nice to get the bodies I'm oblivious you're mad at me you hadn't picked at Bubba
 I don't know you're joking the other day well that's why I'm really up to her now I can't believe she don't worry about it but the funny thing was I sent you this nugget I sent you about an hour ago but an hour before the show because I was sending out the Nugget before the show to read like as it has like a WhatsApp text kind of thing in this one read I've tried to be impartial do I know that a man's past always comes to his views so I was reading it
I was reading what you saying to me I didn't realize I was a quote impartial but I'm ready to kill you oh I apologize right now in front of everybody I buy off of my base and CC please forgive me for my offenses I often lie to you right but that being said I still want to know what it is we can talk privately in a secluded Place holding pinkies I'll listen to you I will do that I'm a better man then we'll Embrace in your mouth right you never break if it's okay I'm a little bit more annoying than you and that's okay
all right before this turns into whole thing when we get into Vault exciting it's a new book that's huge through 66 cantos out of the 12
 and I think even in terms of versus we're pretty much in the middle not so it took us four years to get halfway through
 okay well but the temp gauge was very very big but the third and fourth cancers are big
 okay right Brady yes I just feel like the 3rd and the 4th cancels each one of those is like an extra Kanto and then the temp cancers like for cancer so in the 12th Kansas very small so it kind of evens how does the 11th verse I bet there is a charge to do things like that to me and I don't know yeah like you know that
Akita Mahna Mahna Mahna Mahna by my doctor always think of me because my devoting all the central message or already you know this question people middle verse that's everybody told me today I don't know if there is a middle I don't know if count is like that's the first time a 350 between a 51 out of 700 verse is I'm not sure about that but it's the middle in the sense that it's right at the Seymour the cusp between the 9th and 10th chapters in the 18 chapter book
 okay I'm going to call that the middle at least I want everybody to read that verse today 9:34 at your homework read it three times the verse over and over
 now it now in this rug and I know this isn't it it's interesting when we get started this is a beautiful Kanto in in the the main part of this Kanto will be the story of
great the great about to Yogi little boy little boy also like we're reading about Richard store in the previous Canto born in the family of the Demons right one in the family that is
 what's the word I'm looking for that is kind of like bent into animosity towards towards towards the wall towards the end towards How the Universe Works their kind of against it
 and when we read the previous Cantor we should feel when we discussed this many times that the six cancer was really demonstrating that the distinction between sure
 devotion purelapeer Bucky and Bucky
is mixed and Ginger is kind of the emblem of the mixed bacta and we see it in the end eat throughout that can tow interest full of fear and anger confusion you know and where is Richard Surah who had pure devotion even though he was in the demon family even though he was fighting against did the the the Davis he was fearless and free he had no anxiety had no Hang-Ups he had no anger he had no Envy he had he was he was her free as a burden and when we read that can't do what you feel like how do I become free why did Richard surrogate. Booked an injured doesn't get it
 how did Richard sore develop that in his heart and look at the results of his that freedom even he was born in the demon what does it take
to get pure devotion that's that's kind of going to be the theme of this Canto and it will play out especially in the life of a lot but if the cancer is going to begin
 with this question about in partiality cuz we've seen
 injury is partial
 right he's got this he's got this this like for instance he needed a good priest to do his ritual so that he could get the power that he needed to maintain its position and that and that priest he was he was instructed you'll find that you'll find the right priest and vishwaroopa young 300 priests born in the family the demons bunny was he did his job and he he and partially he was impartial he he he okay you're born in a different family and a different lineage kind of opposed to the one that I'm in but I see you
equally because I have that spiritual equal Vision if you're asking me for help I will see how I can help you any does helping you and he helps injured very effectively but then once he said it wasn't even betrayal but then then the asuras asked him for help any and you offer them some help to because he helped someone when someone asked him for help you know that's just that he saw the world and interest saw that and being partially just saw that as betrayal
 and killed him
 killed him and in and that that set injure into deeper entanglements and deeper states of confusion deeper states of anxiety and in at the very end we heard about how Vishnu protected the day Buzz
 by killing the two most important
of the insurance hiranyaksha and over in your cashew Pooh
 that was mentioned on the last chapter that we read and so now Mara spricket is going to turn the sous vide goswami the speaker the bog with time and he's going to say I want to see it's kind of like fishing takes the side of the Davis like he's playing favorites like he's part of a good question Google you're good, and that question has a lot to do with what does do the people that get the pure bhakti do the people that become free of fear and free of anger and just become free in general is it is the universe set up in a way that is not impartial do some people just do two no merit of their own get special blessings and others don't because it seems like the day was always get the Lord Business favor what's going on if you could read what I said the introduction to this so I can tow
 hours of this chapter of and I'll see what she
said that after won the super real or scream or equal to everyone in this chapter in response to a question by Mirage Cricket sootoday goswami gives its conclusions concerning how does Supreme personality godhead although the super-soul friend and protector of everyone killed the date is the Demons of the sake of Indra the king of Heaven in the statements he totally refused the arguments of the people in general who accused the Supreme Lord of partiality she could have us want me proves that because the body of the condition soul is infected by The Three Goons were the three qualities of nature
 do Audi's awry such as enmity and friendship attachment and Detachment to pause there for a moment that's that that was an important statement right because the body of the condition so that means most of us who are affected by the externals harmine
become program by external stimulus and indeed he uses the word we become infected by these three qualities goodness fashion ignorance or we could say what were the terms that we use we were talking about you saying I'm illumination
 was it attachment illumination attachment and delusions delusion I like that yeah so get out yeah yeah we become infected by those qualities as we as we encounter them they they seep into our subconscious mind so then because of that and only because of that do do Audi's arise Soca 70 and friendship attachment detached if if we were beyond that if our minds and bodies were immune to the effects of these the qualities that are radiating from every external material
this illusion and delusion and attachment then we would have it wouldn't be like we had that person my friend that person to my enemy I'm inclined towards this person I'm not inclined to accept it that wouldn't be but because we are but but the point's going to be here
 is that Vishnu or Krishna isn't condition like us it's even like the points always made that he's the one behind the three most material nature in other words he's the programmer of this universe
 so if I'm a program in a program a computer doesn't mean I become infected with what I just downloaded on my computer so I took the warden living in the computer and then walk into the prison the warden will even put himself in a cell to look around the cell but the warden can leave anytime he wants he said out the guy said he runs the prison yeah he's likes and dislikes I'm a cat person she's a dog person stuff like that
get out your salad yeah we're going to be partial that's part of our limited scope are you nice and to your cat's than you are to hear. Well I've changed I've learned a lot of my dog. My dog just bite you know their little dirtier your little dirtier than dogs cats and litter boxes then jump on countertops and stuff
 I would have been would it could have been would it would if they could subject and I know the zoom viewers are always or so I see cats on the screen right now I see dogs on the screen is because we're all covered by these gunas
 Tracy Conway spin indoor Caster cleaner
they lick their entire body all day so that's why they're cleaned they don't like their genitalia at Chris and I didn't need to hear that at 6 a.m. need that visual okay okay let's go back to my point is we're all trained with likes and dislikes that I trained like that it's not like yeah these are the people that like me that they like me there like me
 is other people that don't like being with other people that are not like me
 right back in for the Supreme purse out of garden
 or the Supreme personalidad whoever there are no such dualities even Eternal time cannot control the activities of the Lord I worship ejected time
I'm about to be 8 tomorrow I'm at school and independent as I think I am I am under the control of the factor of time and if I don't believe it
 I got to go up to one of those one of those mirrors call in the bathroom that magnifies everything what it's called honesty mirrors are like this is what you really think you're going to let you this is what you really look like Sarah might want to look at my nose up close my nose is like disgusting up clothes from the screen and I put that filter on that touch up my appearance. That's right when I was going through your thing there had the touch up filter crank I don't know you do marry a crazy things haven't always wondered why do I why is like when we do the the thumbnail I want to make the thumbnail for the for the Q&A episodes
I get so clear out a good camera and why is this is picture so like distorted you know
 and it's not just your shin that's my face oh that's in the filter this point B is we're subject to the time Factor no how matter how strong we are no matter how wealthy we are no matter how independent we are we're little slaves to the time Factor time is a real thing within the three material modes of nature
 it's the bhakti is the Fountain of Youth my friends okay isn't it is the Fountain of Youth it's the real America Vespucci was looking for the Fountain of Youth we found it right here to Florida for that it High Springs to go in those Springs in Florida as we thought you could drink it's not you got a chance and then you're not a man that you're not up to spot any longer
are they continue continuing on even Eternal time can I control the activities of the Lord Eternal time is created by the Lord ax under his control the Supreme personality of godhead therefore is always Transit Dental to the influence of the modes of nature Maya the Lord's external energy which acts in creation and Annihilation do you want to get up on a hill and just scream the stuff we've got
 over here. All the demons killed by the Supreme Lord attain salvation immediately
 yeah I feel like getting on the top of the hill and say we've got some secrets of the universe you're all looking for the right here contain information a treasure chest of valuable info to transform your life
on the streets of Mumbai and try that today to Let It Go just Let It Go on a soapbox like that John the Baptist or something it was like that cuz that's who I think that's who those kind of Street Preachers model himself after it's on the back after John the Baptist
 and second question the second question raised by Prickett Mirage concerns how shih Shu Paul although in mimical towards Krishna Missouri child was the one of the Rochester your sacrifice when when you to steer arjuna's older brother perform this very everything he said I think it's going to register your sacrifice when you just your arjuna's older brother perform is very big ritual to to claim his Emperor ship
and to worship Krishna as the guest of honour he invited all the lower King she was the emperor of all the lower Kings from Oliver bharatvarsh all over India to come and to pay some tribute some taxes actually and they came and respect but when you just year was asking them to contribute to the ritual and a censure and that's what you do and it's hard to keep diplomacy with the with the emperor and everybody did it all of you to steers big follower people that were his Rivals it still did it cuz I didn't want to cause any Schism but when you just your started worshipping Krishna as the guest of honor that's when some people got angry cuz some people
 especially the Demonic Kings did not see Krishna as who he was which was the Lord of all the demigods then you know the super 10 on the father of the universe they just saw me some puny
Prince and so when they start when everybody started worshipping Chris as a guest of honor shishupal was the first to stand up and say how dare you worship this heard if you wanted to worship someone it was a great powerful King there's many powerful things here if you wanted to worship someone whose people great and knowledge is here if you want to worship one of the elders in a list one person after the other but to worship and waited and waited and then Krishna stood up listed all shih Shu pause crimes cuz he had some serious issues he had he had a track record himself and then he manifested his to darshan chakra
 and through it was a sweetheart Central
Ami's Acres firing us and it is slice the head off of shows you pop that everyone thinks oh how horrible a bloodbath at a religious ritual don't sweat it when she when Krishna kills a demon
 what happened the everybody's visibly saw the soul leave his body like some energetic Force leave and enter into krishna's body
 and so that's always liberators you probably live rated movies killed by Krishna anybody killed by Krishna is liberated immediately that's that's one reason why Christian is impartial
 so that's that's that's part of the evidence that'll be brought up and then you know you're telling me that Christians impartial and it's true I see that even when there are people that are dead set against him even when it comes down to a fight and Yvonne Krishna kills them we all witnessed cuz usually can't see this kind of thing but everybody could kind of see this so like a spark of light go out of an orange
Christmas warm alike or wha what was that that wasn't like I was some very special that he treated him he gave him Liberation you gave me something special even his rival okay I've got it I've got a trivia question for any uninitiated devotee listening on Zoom how many insults did Shoop all the row at Krishna before Krishna cut off his head that is My Trivia Question Maya got it you're good the first time I I used the job is about built out there you guys are good
 you knew the answer you just didn't type is quickly yes
 is okay in the second Race by Wreck-It Mars concerns how she should follow the local towards Krishna from his childhood and all who is blaspheming Krishna attain salvation in Oneness when Krishna killed him
by the way I'm very excited to read hdgo Swami's
 reenactment of this story in his big Mahabharat he's trim translated
 because I'm hoping it will list every insult because they're actually quite funny the insults at Krishna get your squishy ball that you think that list of 100 are there I think it lit I've seen versions were they list all hundred insults and one of them is you think you're so important because you lifted a little clump of dirt like go over downhill oh you think you're so powerful cuz he killed the little duck which was Baca Surah waqiah things like that it's just like whatever somebody does a person who's envious Caesar this puny no big deal you know
 I was always envious of Krishna even from his childhood and I could have this one explains that because of their fences at the feet of the devotees
 the two attendants of Lord of the Lord in Viking
the name ja in Vijay became to Ryan and cashew Pooh and Henry who'd run yakshe insult to you that's the first stage of the agent truth right then they got killed and they were Reaper as Robin and kumbhakarna in the next yoga in trailer yoga
 and then in dwarka you could be born as shishupal and done to bakra at the end of Ages they took the forms of different asuras different date of birth of different demon lineages
 and every time they were killed in Lord Vishnu because of the fruit of Acts giant BG agreed to become the Lord's enemies and when killed in that mentality they attain salvation in Oneness thus even if one thinks of the Supreme personality of godhead in Envy butane salvation
 what
it has to be said of devotees who always engage in the Lord's service with love and faith have you ever met a person who became a devotee from hating the devotees
 I know I have I met someone to he used to like throw things at them and be cruel to them and he ended up becoming to the body not exactly but there is a person that dumb
 I know in Russia there like KGB agents were focused on taking down the devotees and they became devotees and I know that in the Old Brooklyn tab on Henry Street do you know I may have mentioned this on the show before but there was one of those those you do back in the 70s like you know you can buy these books at the drug store right next to call Mike drugstore oh yeah and yeah we talked about things
it was even Pampers like a real book it's like a mini type of book is one about what about a woman kind of pose as like oh I want to join up and get involved in this young lady and so she moved into the temple and live there in the ashram with everyone and I was undercover reporter or something she was an undercover reporter do an Expose and. But even as she's riding the expose she's like kind of getting into a kind of like homeless kind of bullet gets into it that's the problem with bhakti yoga is good you can suck then get the food doesn't suck you in the music sucks here in the ritual suck you in hey we wear flower garlands a lot
 All Stars
