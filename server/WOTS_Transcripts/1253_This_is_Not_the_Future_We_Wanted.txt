 graduates
 and she said she want to hump it and now we're excited maybe we'll go to hump you for a few days because it is only trained right away it's not that far from here and spin on our bucket list
ancient city the city of Hanuman costume for Halloween in doing a lot of you been doing a lot of talk and recognize he talked about chitrakoot you talked about Marca and let's see if you make it to him. You know what sometimes I think less is more sometimes dual asked us to do less but that being said talk more and maybe do less but I have some burning humpy desires inside me and I would I would love to go to hump it I was scheduled to go to Auntie one time but I got a I got sick just before going
 yeah I was all set we have tickets and everything really well it's not that far from here you know they say he is like what is it the viginal Gaara Evans called the Empire
yeah yeah and so does this Ancient Ancient version of Empire right and dedicated to Ramen Hub and the ruins are there
 yeah incredible ruins incredible rooms
 oh man I know where I can I see electricity just went out that's bad that means he's got to unless it comes on again quick he's got to run to start some restaurant or something to get it started
 I hope he'll be with us today when he goes over there tell he's he's going to blackout
 so let me just see if and when we're going to get drug out back hopefully he'll be joining us back in a few minutes which means that I don't know anything about the announcement said Mary was going to make and but I do have a nugget that I really want to discuss with a pocket knife
 so hopefully he'll come in while I'm still talking but I'll give it a shot.
nugget usual is from a Lebanese satirist
 maybe this is something one Corona has heard of before but his name is Carl sharo cuz we do have our Corona and family listening out there in Lebanon so his name is Carl shuttle
 and I see you there and speak to me
 see if he comes back
 okay Corona does not know him which doesn't surprise me.
 As to unmute
 Hey Delilah speak to me when I get there now we're at the wrong or coming back there is she
 okay anyway let's let me read from this nugget about enough
he's going to come in but here we go is from Carl's Shiro the Lebanese satirist and he says this and I think this is something we're thinking about he says humans doing the hard jobs
 great. See you there yeah I'm here
 hopefully your connection is good we'll do it later just do the Nugget were on it you're on it your doing good ready I'm just getting started on it here goes humans doing the hard jobs on minimum wage
 while the robots write poetry and paint is not the future that I want to hit what robot you're painting and doing a I right so you know when we were kids
right
 there was all this talk about how and I guess I guess it goes Pride back or two early with the 42 the 50s or something like that maybe even before then but sure the one we were going out there's any others talk like you know eventually the machines can do all the hard work and will be free and will only work like one day a week and will be free to roam around and do the things you want to do you creative do whatever you want to do but somehow it doesn't work out that way we're stuck inside doing computer programming and the computers are creating the painting is in the music and end the art you know poetry writing book still doing all the creative stuff that we want to have time for
 you know this with the machines are starting to do that which is not only disappointing but they kind of creepy but you know we were around you and I think it was a few days ago or a week ago or some of that we're talking about how her run your costume
we are in the Bog of Time how he was trying to beat the system
 sure he was trying to become immortal you do through practicing austerities and seeing if he could even though it was too he was told that he couldn't become a mortal he just try to get benedictions in such a way where he were practically got around
 carotid about into some kind of loophole when I hear you know when I hear this is like it's a it's like as a civilization you know we
 we want to try let like another if we take these ancient texts or probably practically any wisdom culture but let's go ahead and take ours right and it says yeah you can live in this world than you can live relatively peaceful and satisfied and happy most of you should be Farmers right you should you know what you need will come from the earth see what you did you get
Cows and Bulls and you love them like they're your own family members and you treat them with love and respect and care and they're going to provide for you the energy that you need and the power that you need the food that you need the clothes that you need the oil to like your light up your homes at night you know they're going to provide the Earth in this in the cows and provide everything that you need live simply be satisfied with that you want to have sex go ahead have sex and then raise children and how they take the responsibility that comes with it and it's like we try to get around these things in so many ways and it never really works and where as miserable as we've ever been you know where where is probably more neurotic than we've ever been just no way around it
 yeah you know drives me crazy it was when my computer which is basically a robot asked me are you sure you're not a robot as I have to prove
robot computer that I'm not a robot and by doing jumping through so many Hoops for my robot just to get the robots approval of my human ship that's skin I don't know you're not a robot just checking and yeah yeah beat the shit out of Walt Disney trying to beat the system they're going to freeze his body to look that up but she can find it you're into getting until these guys Walt Disney and other one
 what was the guy that you did yesterday Howard Hughes but I was an urban legend in that Walt Disney was frozen believe that you tried to read the whole thing will you freeze your body and urban myth
 it's an urban myth okay
stand corrected anyway the rate against time and I get it we don't want to get old and die
 you never know you never know what you could be fearing the greatest thing that's ever happened you know maybe death is this whole entryway into a much better existence than this world a three-fold miseries and you know I don't think death is one thing I would try to help people try to get around to it and that's what's so ironic ashepoo thing but whatever it may be if if within ourselves if you don't has a lot to do with what are values is and what we think success looks like and we think a penis looks like you could bring it down and if we if we get the idea that what am I looking for in this life am I am I looking to satisfy the senses and find you know sensual thrills
 you know or find pleasure through things like fame or Prestige or money
or whatever or is that not what it's all about could it be about that it's about learning something learning lessons in life you know who it is is there some message and I'm supposed to be at that the movements of this world are are speaking to me are informing me if I'm open to hearing the message now and that attitude means okay if that's what I'm looking for and let me live simply and let me be kind and and let me try to take him with messages are there in a 5 thinking that that's not it. No it's not about learning anything it's about enjoying you know through the senses as much as possible I'd become complicated and I am in very likely I'll become unkind very likely my needs what I perceive as much as my knees
 begin to seem to overlap with the needs of the perceived needs of other people and that leads to conflict and
tensions that bring up anxiety that brings so much anxiety in the community and the culture either endorse is it or makes it it's slackens it up a little I know it like where I live in LA or New York to it any any sort of big city where the currency is your beauty the currency is your strength of currency is your your your money when that's when that's your focus
 it's a problem when you start getting older and losing your beauty you know I get four I mean I know all this stuff and I still get frustrated like you started losing your beauty well I was never a Covergirl believe it or not your beauty slipping away
 is there a cover girl or a Sports Illustrated her muscle and fitness magazine guy although I was at one point as to be in yoga journal but it never happened is that what yoga journal means that you like
tractor some good-looking yoga person on the cover okay but anyway where was I going do you think do you think that you think that's there's some editors over the yoga journal said okay who do you who do you think you're going to cover you know if I'mma send what we got this guy rug enough Capo let's see the photos well I got news for you it was at a time when I was a little better-looking before my kids my kids and my marriage age me tremendously okay oh no headlights flicker do you see that it's like it's like Blair Witch Project
 I don't know it just that we go I guess we got a warning that when we get the blinking hopefully we're going to be back soon all right so any case we smoke a little bit but that is you know if you think about it if we think about this is something that when we
I was a kid when recognize was a kid if we would have thought yeah this technology we couldn't have we would have thought that machines could write books that machines could create intricate art we would have thought that but that's what they're doing now
 and we would hope that that is a technology increases that our burdens you know our our work burdens with decrease and somehow it doesn't work that way at all, it seems like it's working almost like entirely opposite of that so any case I just thought that was an issue I thought it was interesting a general his observation but I thought in particular it was interesting it in terms of I just ate your the broader message I brought a message about how no matter how
no matter how technologically advanced we get no matter how intelligent we are no matter how much wealth we accrue or how powerful we become we really just can't get around the system and the only way that we're going to find satisfaction is through a simpler and kind your lifestyle and in that simpler and kind of Lifestyle it's that's the conducive lifestyle for her learning the lessons that were meant to learn you know otherwise we're blocking that is that mode of passion is that is really a lot of it is a difference between Suffolk Luna and Rodger Guna re Raja Gana
 meaning I'm not satisfied I want to change the externals so that I can find the happiness of the satisfaction than looking for and SEPTA going or which has more to do with contentment which you know maybe the print the person that's ever going to may have far less in terms of resources than the personal Rodger going to put their butt in their mind the saying I have what I
I don't need more you know I'm willing to accept the circumstances as they are
 and because of it because I'm not focus on changing the externals
 I can actually go with him as long as I'm dissatisfied with the externals as long as the externals annoy me bother me confound me or tempt me
 I can never go with him but once I become content with the extras once they're at once they're at a reasonable level and I said you know what that's enough that that that that will work now I'd like all of that and I can actually start to take you to look with him to take with him and so that's what that's that's what you know I can see the bhakti cultures all about but I could say Bucky culture culture in general and has to do with cultivating that its Simplicity and
when the kindness which is typical to have without the Simplicity all right I just got a message from raaga. Who says he's trying he's trying to come back I mean while want to go ahead and chance opening shlokas
 and we can stop by with him
 there I am no mas que NADA on Dave and Sarah's reciting the Schumann bar with Tom which is the very means of Conquest when should offer respectful obeisances under the personality of God hidden or Ayana on sun round or I know reshy super most human being a mother sarswati the goddess of learning and I'm sure she loved you a sativa the Oscar
 messed up trying to save it to you tomorrow okay nice sticky I regular tenants in class
on the bottom and by rendering a service to the pier to votee all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service unto the person out who got it was praised with transgender songs is established as an irrevocable fact
 oh my God.
 I was born in the darkness of ignorance and my spiritual masters of open my eyes with the torture knowledge that off of my respect for the bases on to them
 okay
 so
 picking up where we left off yesterday we were reading we're going to give me a phone call
 arvo
 hello
 he hung up on me too he can't get it together today
alright let me try again so what we were reading short bob with time
 I can't have seven chapter 4 which is entitled to run your kashyap who terrorizes the universe and I believe that we would read up to text 17 so we'll pick up at Exit 18 now see let me see if I can give you a bit of a recap
 I'll run out the saying
 that I may have to do the show with that so let's see how it goes.
 Okay so let's let's get busy and hopefully we're going out to be back not sure if he will or not we're reading we're up to text 18 and this is describing how he run Akashi poo how through his austerity he gain power with his power
took the the property of his Rivals right now he's living in the Palace of the Lord Andrew Lord Andrew who is dedicated to Vishnu
 is kicked out here and Akashi poo his who is dedicated to killing Lord Vishnu is now in and his influence is so strong and his power is so great that pretty much everyone
 has to submit to him
 and it's not that he's incompetent as a ruler reading now about just how prosperous
 things were under his rule so that's where we left off I will pick up Intex 18 see what he has to say
 text 18 The Valleys between the mountains became fields of pleasure for renew cashew Pooh by whose influence all the trees and plants produce fruits and flowers profusely and All Seasons qualities of pouring water
drying and burning with your all the qualities in the three departmental heads of the universe daily Indra value and hug me we're all DirectBuy Renny koshy pool alone without assistance from the demigod Dimensions water pouring water that's the job of injury he's the god of the rain drawing that's the job of value he's the god of the wind and burning that's the that's the realm of Agni the god of fire these are fundamental Universal elements according to the ancient Vedic texts are these are not things that just happen randomly but these are things that are just like a ninny
 government Governor city government there are departments with department heads that regulate the water that regulates the in the different tone
 the different systems that this that works throughout the city that these have rulers and Erin Akashi poop
so powerful and selfish he doesn't even need and Reviving only he's directing these things on his own
 text 19
 in spite of achieving the power to another such as interesting this is interesting
 in spite of achieving the power to control in all directions and in spite of enjoying all types of deer scents craftcation as much as possible
 Johnny Cash if he was dissatisfied
 because instead of controlling his senses he remained their servants
 okay that you know now that that
 that text
 is very reminiscent of a texted recognized and I have been quoting a bit and that will be coming up in the 8th Kanto which again is the texts that it's it's a famous first spoken by Lord Vishnu himself in his in car
patient has vomited
 when the when the
 the relative did the descendant of hiranyakashipu named Bali who's also born in the demonic
 in a demonic lineage but a devoted heart when he he's he meets Lord Vishnu in the guise of a of a dwarf brahmacharya any and because the king's honor the Brahman has he says ask me what you want I'll be happy to provide it for you
 and vomited Eve in Bushnell is Gold Bond relief says I only want three steps of Lance three steps so little
 I could offer you so much why would you want only three little steps of land
 and he says this verse that that kind of his heart very harmonious with what we're eating here he says all that there is within the
our universe that there is to satisfy the sentence right all the beauty everything that tastes delicious everything that feels satisfying and everything that that looks beautiful everything that smells you know with a beautiful everything that there is to satisfy the census was in the entire universe is not enough
 satisfy the senses of someone whose senses are uncontrolled
 now here we have an example of a run across people who have conquered it all
 everything that he was imagining in his mind when he took up his arse tears and let's think about those austerities again he's standing on his toes with his arms in the air all right for years and years and years is a time is the most intense too puffy performing to Pasha to forming austerities as a yogi so determined that even though his body is being eaten by ants
can termites he maintains his body in his bones and his entire body is is wrapped up in it encompassed by a giant ant hill and he's going on and on like this for years and years so determined to achieve his desires to achieve the power in the position that he saw it and then he got it
 and even though he got it all if he hasn't mentioned to your Hunter Ani Kashi poo is dissatisfied because instead of controlling his senses he remained their servant but he was he was actually he was conquered by his senses he was the servant of his senses are generally we think that when we're serving our senses
 that we're in control we don't stop to think that hold it it seems to be that my senses are in control and I'm and I'm serving them so
let's read Rochelle provinces in his commentary says this is an example of a Sorak life 80s can Advanced Materials in Canton trade in and can't create an extremely comfortable situation for the census of because they are controlled by the senses they cannot be satisfied this is the effect of modern civilization materialist and so here we go you know this is the day we were just like we're reading in the the Nuggets today right we can create so much we can control so much modern civilization can design so much this is the effect right but because they are controlled by the senses they cannot be satisfied materials are very much Advance enjoying money and women your dissatisfaction prevails within Human Society
 because Human Society could not be happy and peaceful without Krishna Consciousness and you know it says you know course when it says is materialist
how much Advance enjoy money and women in it and in our Modern Age where women are larger liberated you know it's it's it's whether it's men or women were seeking satisfaction to money were seeking satisfaction through position or seeking men of satisfaction to power or seeking satisfaction through sex
 because we're controlled by these things were never satisfied because they are never those desires are never satisfied who is it and end it is it's like if you're pouring gasoline on fire the fire doesn't say okay thank you that was enough gasoline and I'm satisfied now know the more that you pour on it the more that have laces profile containers as far as material sense gratification is concerned materialist may go on increasing their enjoyment as far as they can imagine
 but because people in such a material condition or service of their senses they cannot be satisfied and run your cashew Pooh was a vivid example
of this is satisfied state of humanity
 alright so text Tony continues has passed a long time being very much proud of his opulentus and transgressing the laws and regulations mentioned in the authoritative shastras in-store tooth text wisdom texts he was therefore subjected to a curse by the four Kumar's who are great prominence in this is this is going back you know if we go back to the third Canto week remember how did it run your crush will get in this position
 he was one of The Gatekeepers of the vicomte of the spiritual realm and he was cursed by the four Kumar has to take birth in the families of the source so this is his second birth no first berth in the families are in the dynasties of these Source text 21 everyone including the rulers of the
his planets was extremely distressed because of the severe punishment inflicted upon them by here when you catch tapu fearful and Disturbed unable to find any other shelter the last surrender to the Supreme personality we got additional and this is a common theme that we find in in the Piranhas is that when things get too difficult they turn to Vishnu all the various Davis turn the dish now they approached him and they they want for their prayers and hear the prayers text 22 and 23 let us offer a respectful obeisances unto the day that direction
 unto that direction where the Supreme personality of God it is situated
 widow's purified souls in the renowned Steward of Life the great saintly persons go and from which having gone they never return
 without sleep fully controlling their minds and living only on their breath the predominating DD's of the various
and it's began to worship increase acacia
 with this meditation Richie Keysha refers to Lord Vishnu literally Hershey keishin means that the controller of the senses he's he's the one that's Altima lie behind their functioning
 and and so we can see that in their distress they wanted to communicate they wanted they wanted it was almost like we need to pick up the phone
 and connect with that being who's ultimately the one who ties this entire universe together we need to reach that being and that being may not be easy for us to reach
 even though that being is everywhere we may be out of contact with that be and so in order to facilitate that contact they knew it requires absorbing our mind deeply and so they did external things is how Yoga Works right external
external practices that help settle the mind so that one can go internal find God so what did they do so they went without sleep
 they fully controlled their minds and their living only on their breath so they weren't eating or sleeping they were sitting in going into deep meditation so let's let's turn on this too because it is the average their prayer again was short and simple I said let us offer respect for the bases on to that direction they're aiming at a certain place on to that Direction with the Supreme personality. It is situated where those purified souls in the renowned sort of Life the grates in the persons they go to those places and from which haven't gone they never return
 I would just do a true property rights, Terry he says the two words tussi I
are there a significance
 let me see what this let me see those words
 Tasha means answer that in castalia means Direction
 probably since the two words are very significant everywhere and every everywhere in every direction in every heart and in every atom
 the Supreme personality got it is situated in his features as Brahman and Parma okay that's an interesting and he's matching two ways when we hear about
 the absolute truths for supreme god
 when when The Vedic texts speak of that God they speak of that Divine being as manifesting at 3
different ways 1 ways called Grumman 1 ways called Panama in 1 ways called Bhagavad so Brahmin means is the impersonal all-pervasive feature of God meaning that
 everything
 is made out of in one sense everything that exists
 in all creation in all the spiritual Realms and all the material around it all exists is all the transformation of the energy of one central figure and that is sweet baby Krishna right that from his body just like the sun it emanates heat and light
 so from the figure of Krishna that Eternal form emanates the Rays of the Brahma Jyoti is his spiritual energy
everything including the material world that we live in is a transformation of that energy sometimes probably would say he would quote that says a piranhas with this verse up pressure shock to your Vivid imma shoot a that that the Supreme Lord he works using his multifarious energies everything is accomplished by his his different energies and there's a famous verse in the Brahma samhita that speaks about this energy that 78 and yes y'all are Bob up I was told you I got nothing to koti koti swish a suppository the booty be numb thumb is the prayers of Lord Vermont
 and he says
 I serve the Supreme personality God is Govinda that's that street Christian sweet baby could not serve Govinda and devoted to govind our worship
when do the Primeval Lord whose transcendental bodily fulgence known as the Brahma Jyoti the the the default into the light of Brahman spiritual like the Divine Light.
 Who's transito Valley Forge known as the Brahma Jyoti which is unlimited unfathomed and all-pervasive is the cause of the creation of unlimited numbers of planets
 with all different varieties of climates in specific conditions of life so sad that this Brahma Joe T's it's all Chris is all spiritual energy emanating from the form of Sri Krishna and it transforms in different ways including into this material world but it's all his conscious spiritual energy is everywhere so not since God is everywhere because his energy and his Consciousness is everywhere that's Brahman and then part of Miami
means that that Krishna takes on another Forum you could say expands into another form a multi forms down to the form of the sword Vision that's within the heart of every living being and within every atom
 so if we realized the Brahmin if we realize that everything is made of one energy everything that exists is part of one Divine source is with all made of one energy that manifests in different ways and I am made of that same energy and I really I'm made of that energy but every living being is made of that out of that energy in the world that we live in is made out of that energy we call that Brahman realization we realize I'm Eternal I'm Blissful Consciousness I'm on changing I'm not constructed out of this ever-changing now
I'm infinite I'm beyond the corners and I'm and I'm in neatly free I'm I'm beyond fear and suffering I'm made of pristine spiritual energy and pure you know how could I faultless I'm beautiful I'm Blissful that is what I'm made of that the call that Brahman realization I don't change I don't die you know by the influence of time I know myself to be made of this principle of Eternity it is inside me it's what I'm made of we call that brought in a realization
 and part of Mama realization music I know that within this energy of the material this which is the transformation of that Divine effulgence
 where in the element of time or in effect where in the element of karma is in fact we're in the three gunas are in effect and they all are influencing
I realize that within every atom of this energy and within the heart of every living being is Lord Vishnu a form of Lord Vishnu a conscious entity that is tying the entire thing together
 at this this this is
 this awareness is so omniscient and unlimited
 that it can tie together the karma of every living being
 Supply and provide and create in just such a way that we are that we have the opportunity to learn the lessons that were meant to learn as we move through this world that there's a controller behind it all week all that part of Mama realization
 Vagabond realization means that all of that the impersonal Brahman energy
 that person
form within the heart of every living being
 that both of these come
 from one sweet beautiful person named Sweet Baby Krishna Krishna that that form called that form bagha byne and so we can know Garden either these three different levels we can do as an impersonal energy we can know I'm within the heart and we could know him as a person out what about a speaking to hear is he sang
 you saying the two words are very significant because everywhere in every direction and every heart and in every atom the Supreme personally got it a situation its features is Brahman a mama these are all pervasive aspects of krishna's presents so why do these demigods when they're trying to connect with them why do they point in one particular direction when God is everywhere
 it continues
then what is the purpose of saying Tessa Costello in the direction where Harry is situated in the direction of Lord Vishnu or where God is situated
 and it continues during your run across your post time
 his influence was everywhere but he could not force his influence into the places where the Supreme personality. It has his past times for example on this Earth are such places as when David and I owed you with your called Dom's
 in the Dom there's no influence of from Kali Yuga or any demon if one takes shelter of such a dumb
 worship of the Lord becomes very easy and resultant spiritual advancement quickly takes place in fact in India one may still go to vrindavan and similar places to achieve the results of spiritual activities quickly and so that is part of you knows like we're going out tonight we just took a group here to another to
navigate to be possessive Dom or David is a dumb High OG is a damn what the what the sages say is that we live in a bubble that is a transformation of the Brahmin energy but if you could say it's a cloud floating within that spiritual energy but it's a cloud of material energy to Cloud again we're time is present where where The Goonies have their influence where where the law of karma is in effect
 and but these places when David or number to weep or are you owed you they are actually from the spiritual realm and they manifest here if you could say it's it's the spiritual world was in the material energy or we might say it's like a Vortex said how to say don't let me look up the word vortex and see exactly what I think that's an appropriate word or text a massive were living fluid or are specially Whirlpool a whirlwind
definitely when people use the word vortex they mean like an entryway into another realm and you could say it's an entryway into another realm or you can say actually did that other round in this room but I suppose my walking into your walking into if that's what app or text me in the morning to this definition doesn't mean that so she'll probably stay there for these demigods they aimed in that direction the ended in the direction where they knew the contact with that Divine being is very accessible is very open is very is is is
 is very close there one can feel it there and probably says it's a fact an indie one they still go to vrindavan and Sewer places to cheat the results of spiritual activities and you know we do that and we feel that
 8 x 24
 there then there
here before them a transcendental sound vibration emanating from a personality not visible to materialize
 the voice was as Grave as a sound of a cloud and was very encouraging driving away all fear so they they didn't sleep they didn't eat they wanted to deep absorption meditation and prayer to open up a line of communication and then they heard a message and that message was his very beautiful voice very deep voice grave is a sound of a cloud and was very encouraging when they heard this voice there was no fear in them even though the situation was so fearful
 just hearing his voice all fear was dissipated the voice of the Lord vibrated as follows
 old best of learning persons do not fear I wish all good fortune to you become my devotees by hearing a chanting about me and offering me prayers
but these are certainly meant to Ward benedictions to all living entities I know all about the activities of her in your car shampoo and she'll surely stop them very soon please wait patiently until that time
 so OK the message comes and essentially what he says is
 have no fear I'm here for you but also did they get instructions on how to engage themselves how to engage their minds
 and essentially a word they were given the fundamental practice is about to hit hearing chanting I'll shovel a to them mundhinam offering prayers and through this they will feel that connection and others in hearing that voice Their Fear was dissipated
 essentially saying here's where you can remain connected to me right
you you fasted and you didn't sleep and you picked up the telephone and you gave me a call through deep absorption the mind you can maintain that connection and never feel fear
 through these practices especially hearing a chanting right especially hearing from the sacred texts and enchanting the names of Krishna through that I one will always feel a connection
 when one is envious of the demigods who represent the Supreme percent of the United of The Vedas which give all knowledge of the cows and brahmas by snow Biz in religious principles and ultimately me the Supreme personally guided he and his civilization will be vanquished without delay
 would you run your cashew Pooh teases the great devoting so this is still business speaking he says when I run across you poop when he teases the great devotee provide his own son who is peaceful
and sober and has no enemy
 I shall kill her and you catch tapu immediately
 I despite their addiction super mama
 so he's saying this person he thinks he's beat the system he hasn't beat the system and as soon as he crosses the line that line you know even though he's done so much and taking such control the real line that he's going to cross his how he treats his son who is a very
 devoted
 so
 property rights here in the
 Indian commentary
 he said a vaishnava like Prelude
 is described here in his near vaira having no enemies of time it is said a job that's a third of a Shanta south of a solution devotee has no enemies he's
useful he abides by the scriptures and all its characteristics are Sublime the holy does not create and mighty with anyone but if someone becomes his enemy that person will be vanquished by the Supreme purse out of God of despite whatever benedictions he may have received from other sources so we run across people with certainly enjoying the fruitful results of his austerities but here the Lord says that as soon as he committed an offence of the law to speed up early. He would be ruined once longevity opulence Beauty scuse me longevity opulence Beauty education and whatever else when they possess as result of Pais activities cannot protect one if one commits an offence at the Lotus feet of a vaishnava pure
 devoted so despite what everyone possesses if you want to fence a low speed of a violation of it they will be vanquished okay
 text 29 the great Saint Bernard
Muni continued when the Supreme personality of God of the spiritual master bedroom industrial short all the demigods living in the Heavenly planets
 it offered the respectful obeisance is unto him and returned
 confident that the demon who run your car shampoo is now practically dead he's like what are they called the Dead Man Walking
 hiranyakashipu had four wonderful well-qualified sons of whom the one named Pearl odd was the best
 indeed provide was a reservoir of all transcendental qualities because he was an unalloyed devotee of the personality of got it now we're hearing about her lot with were three and a half chapters in to the seven Canto but we're now we're beginning to hear about the person that we're going to hear front here about and hear from a great night. You know this is largely that the Pastime of Lord and Shrink tape
