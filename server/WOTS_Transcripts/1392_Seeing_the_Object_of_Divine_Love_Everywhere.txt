I was just calling in the sage Community platform and I got shot down by everybody involved in the family was like no no no no now it's just become a supporting member
 yeah yeah
 whatever happened to ask you are recognized by the way that's it does not fit me okay well good morning anything you want to say cuz I still got any any other announcements you know this are our guests today right it is speaking to you. You've been there is a bit of a tragedy you know in our body part about the community recently it said
at a place that you visit I never been there before but of course that was Weiss
 all right once you Philistine well there's no beautiful devotee Community up in Northern Canada on the west coast north of Vancouver in the woods called Sharon Accardi Farm Village has called Saskatchewan yeah you going to be there and people just said you know what is right and I just I'm sick of living in the city I want to start raising my kids and natural way living a natural way and the credit of this beautiful Community there but there was a little off the grid little Off the Grid little up the grid
 and they had a forced a lot of forest fire wildfire
wildfire and is devastated that some home so we have Ron how Prema bhakti
 yes we're too far north I get but yes definitely North computer computer thank I think everybody here knows where that is we are entirely off-grid so we are yes there's no City sewage there's no City Water there's no City Power we're all depended on solar we have our water sources are Creek cir Springs and Cody's have figured out a way to plumb those into houses and really do still but I was busy
40 years isn't such a big deal now how how many people live in that Community Village itself that it is
 I think the last count was approaching eighty and then of course there's you know all of their nipples Bali so we've got our our broader Community there there's too many farms and there's Blue Earth Lake Forest farm for the wrap and you know we're all friends and neighbors and part of the same community and so yeah it's it's a bit broader than just turn on me Village Valley right now I personally do not count myself as a Pioneer we've only been here for
but there are peonies out there are definite Pioneers here I did some recordings of iskcon Canada Pioneer recordings a few years back and
 some of the stories they're they're incredible and I need these divorcees they they they forage this incredible community that is you know I mean there's a varying degrees of austerity within the valley by I-10 to do a little for the less degrees of austerity the Christian is very graciously allowed me to get a feel for better higher levels of austerity this event but anyway you know the community school there's and kids I mean they'll graduate with a high school diploma there is the temple which is super vibrant and has just exploded and visitors in the past
it's a eight months this doesn't sound vague the most people but the wrath of vajra this couple weeks ago a week or two before this event happened what we had 1200 guess and that's incredible I guess for a festival at their okay yeah it was it was pretty wild and then you know there's that there's a ghost show that there are all of our listeners may not know all these terms so so there's I think yeah there's where we're doing really well this morning yeah so there's quite a vibrant thing there's tons you know there's multiple organic farming initiative
I personally I've got sheep and you know would make textiles from their wool and yeah so there's lots of interesting things happening here so it's kind of a community that's
 I would say in response to Chaparral pods commentaries and bought with Tom about the this is actually
 the natural way to live right in harmony with the Earth and harmony with the animals that we can live a simpler life and be very content and happy maybe a little bit more austere I have to say simple living is not simple in any way shape or form but you do have a profound appreciation for the conveniences that one does have you know and I mean sure not getting mean surrender so we're all striving to do you know
have this mood of surrender and really try and realize that we are not in control of anything and this event has really highlighted that and it's too long to tell us about the event so I think it's
 almost a month ago now they're I mean we live in a very dry Corridor we live between two mountain ranges so you know the coastal mountains the rain comes kind of gets blocked against those mountains and then from the other side it's the Rockies and so we're in a nice dry stretch we lived in I think the only official desert in Canada based on rainfall annual rainfall and so yeah every summer is fire season and anybody who you know who lives in a dry climate kind of knows what that's like so there was a dry lightning storm
and one of The Ridges couple ridges over it got heads and a fire started because we've been in drought this past winter was very very very little snow pack so everything is dried up and so when that lightning hits just everything is right up so a lot of fires started ours was the first big one and it was inaccessible to firefighters in firefighting equipment so it got out of control quite quickly and you know we actually had a meeting with the local government officials and Welfare Services just to kind of talk about you know how the fire was going to be around for the whole summer and how that would impact our community and how we would let you know sort of live beside this for the next few months and then somebody looked up in the fire was on the Ridge and the official said okay everybody everybody out now
 so we had a couple
words to go and I mean normally we were prepared we've got her to go bags that kind of saying but
 as we had the issue of trying to load the Sheep who refused move
 so yeah I we had to leave them behind they were rescued a week later they're normally quite Cooperative but it was you but I mean you could see the fire it was it was I thought it was a huge Brigade of helicopters the sound and then my husband said actually that's the fire and so you do when somebody says a roaring fire
 the sound is so potent and you know why I mentioned the eye
surrender and realizing how small and not in control we are and so standing there watching those Flames literally explode down the mountain through the tree was very very humbling and it was pretty awe-inspiring to be perfect these forces of nature you know material energy they are definitely Unstoppable and so anyway all all the devotees evacuated almost all the animals evacuated the cows were all evacuated and then devotees were displaced and only just recently were able to come back those were able to be houses yes our family home was laws there were five or six others as well Plus
 tons of infrastructure
has lost so I mean agriculture is next to Impossible we still weed living rangeland so ranchers cattle come through here and if legal in British Columbia it's private home owners job to keep them out with private fencing so that means all of our agricultural Endeavors have kind of been just thrown out the window now
 so there's that there's there's the homes I mean aspirin staying with friends right now just because we've got nowhere to go we've got a beautiful pile of rubble I can't imagine what that must be like I'm so sorry I don't even know if I can fully imagine it it's quite surreal
 we've been doing it over the past little bit Yeah so I mean there's there's homes lost there's
agriculture infrastructure are brand-new greater and snow plow just went out you know we we maintain our own roads so that's a real kicker I just found out that last night you know the the devotee who has the post pounder to put in fencing that all went up so so many people's livelihoods were affected as well we had small meals that were destroyed melted like that's how hot this was yeah there's you know would you live out there a sawmill is like yeah it's like having absolutely is so I don't know what it was but I won't have it run by itself
 is it says like a heavy equipment machine so we attach this to a
psycho and then because the ground here is not the most for tile ground like yeah I know you can do it by hand most of this has been done by hand but I mean it a few years ago when we got the sheet we thought we had two small little thing and stop and we went this will be fine no it wasn't within two weeks we were like I became a Shepherd because I had no digging holes dug a hole before I saw stick and then if you've got complete like we did very dry here so if it's not a simple things I do are post pounder is very helpful you know there are hand tools that you can get which make it easier but ultimately if you've got
kilometers and kilometers of fence lines to replace you want to do want to put powder it's it's a fine choice so so so there are some homes lost and there's a lot of infrastructure lost and is there a plan to get things back up and get through the water solutely yes so you know we're reaching out to I mean as a community were coming together and seeing what we can do just in terms of leg being a group effort days in terms of clean up the amount of clean up that there is is incredible there is burnt metal and debris everywhere there are you know if there was any sort of plastic irrigation like that. You know it's all not great in terms of safety so yeah they'll be lots of that to do we have because here's the real kicker we because we're off grid because we heat with wood because we don't have City service
City water and fire hydrants because we are too far from fire services
 insurance is either inaccessible or so cost-prohibitive that none of us have it
 so now we are fundraising we have a website there's there's two that lead to the same place venables Valley wildfire.com or sharanagatam wildfire.com and so there are different venues for we're doing some crowdfunding at this point so any little bit is so extremely appreciated you know people in the area want to
 want to offer service in terms of you no physical labor
cousin super soul farming holsters
 kind of these volunteer weekends are people, and they just like to work maybe if you did city city Folk come up we don't have to guess I was so normally when we bring people in yet they stay in in individuals homes and because a lot of those Extra Spaces are taken up by displays individuals at this point. It's trickier but that being said you know the the local community there they're jumping in and you know just the Valley Community itself plus the surrounding towns there they're all jumping in yeah but I mean things like skill sets and construction materials and all the things that we need because you know my ten-year-old daughter she said this so incredibly she said
it is not just a place it's the people because somebody asked me you know us our homes are still here yours is everything is completely gone why are you staying and I looked at this individual I said because I love you and everybody else here and this community is so incredible and that's why every single one of us
 Bills beat the extreme in potestad to rebuild after a disaster like this and you know so much Forest is destroyed and this is you don't realize how attached we are to these living entities and these trees you know yeah and they're individuals who 40 years into their their Homestead and they're sure it says incredible right so yeah we're all pitching in and anybody else who wants to pitch in we are so incredibly grateful for it we've got those websites up on our chat board and will
put them in the descriptions to this podcast wherever you find it so people to do a little research if you'd like to help out and it's a great cause it's really you know you got to admire people that so many people talk about natural living going back and recognize we all recognize the faults of Modern Life and problems is creating have a polluting the world and destroying the Earth in so many ways and have a group of people get together and says hey let's do different it's going to be hard but we can do it in and we can cultivate a deeper beautiful spiritual understanding about who we are to each other who we are into nature who we already gods and let's do together you got in my people that that you don't put their money where their mouth is really go out and I appreciate it to dash so yeah it's a beautiful idea to be for community and if you'd like to help you can just look in the description of the podcast and then help out a little do a little research help out thank you so much for joining us this morning I appreciate I know it said three hours earlier there as well
flirty time write out a muggle or take for this thank you thank you so much for Rose and thank you everybody good luck to you in our prayers, some of our people will reach out for your community and we want to come back and visit that wonderful community that too soon I will be welcoming everybody table
 you know I tell you there's something I mean I'm appreciating the the community we have on the podcast but imagine if
 you know you wake up in the morning and there's Linda Linda Linda across the field and then there's Jeff Eisenberg who's living in a tree house somewhere and then there is Lori pack in the chief who have like one of those earth homes that are built into the side of a mouse out of old recycled tires you got Thomas egg lemon and Shasta you know Vin
trailer in the back making music and is it's sort of cool just have to wake up and have people that you love and people part of the community with sort of the similar values that it's really really cool to have that going I'm very appreciative of the people and also it makes me think of all the people are complaining about everything and clogging traffic because they want the World to Change but they themselves don't really want to change then I want to get a cell phones and I want to get up her cars and wanted to let you know if you're really going to complain about the world in that way go out and live it first go out and live that way first what a great example of a protest at the protest right there you're protesting have the world but you know what it's in what sense is beyond the protest because protest can be just talk but someone says let me go do some let me not just be a critic but let me ask you to do something that's what I
I said did I say that what new you said it's a protest and I'm saying it's more than a protest
 sorry Rebecca you said it's more than what that's why I said it's more than just that but yeah but they're actually you said it best to put their money where their mouth is and they're like this is how we live in l.a. that it's yet and if she made this great Point like simple living is not simple cuz basically cuz we drifted so far away from natural living so you know if I want something I just go on Amazon and say I want to but tomorrow I want to deliver tomorrow and it's going to be manufactured in China and I want a broom make a brew I got to learn how to make a when you're living off the grid I'm sure you can go to Costco to buy stuff and bring it back but I'd love to do that as well it's not like they all have handmade bruised but I appreciate bad spirit
and I don't know maybe we should all retire in a community together cuz scuba you know what do you think about me is your neighbor hi I'll be your Kramer just dropping in to your hot sauce, are you humoring me like when my kid says Dad can we build a secret panel in the wall oh yeah it's possible neighbors is possible that the city you know we have to see where the Lord directs us you know and if that's good
 alright prayers and you still saying Ostrom in my poor innocent something still there you in my portion of my poor Henry sheet case when you think about that maybe for the Summers
 yeah she sang a summer home in a winter home
 all right
material before starting to see my bag of time witches are very mean to Conquest when should I expect the base and see is to the Supreme Lord Narayan on 290 Ryan Reese you the Super Bowl human being into mother's house of learning and destroy the Piasa day of the author messed up radiation boundary shooting at your mug of a Save-A-Lot bag of it to you too much low-key talk to your brother can I sticky but regular tenants in class is The Bob & Tom and I render a service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome the Haro become Raticate 11:00 service to the Supreme Lord it was praised the transit of the songs we established as in a revocable fat oh my God. The Miranda
parts of the knowledge I have probation fees at their Lotus feet
 come here until 7 chapter 14 text 41 at two more text year
 this is the what is it called the ideal household yeah this is a conclusion in the conclusion of this chapter on
 I do family life but yeah instructions to household as hell what are responsibilities what where should we focus how should we spend our time how should we spend our energy so that we don't get lost so that we stay on a status. You know Stan is spiritual path in a really Dynamic way and its winding up with
 the idea of
 you can say worship you know it it's interesting how the word worship is use me with tacos with that that but like the previous verse that we just read
 there's Temple worship and it was described here we heard about how
a warship was developed
 when when people could no longer enter into deep somebody just to meditation right when people having trouble finding God just in there hard by sitting down and quietly you know alone going deep within when we let our minds became too distracted for that then there's a prescription right there's a remedy for it and that remedy is that you can kind of make like this building is represents the heart and you place the DD form of God in that building and then you bring her tension to that form you know now you can engage your senses rather than just sitting quietly and that'll help you bring your mind to God but the ideas at that will help you bring your mind to God in your own heart and in the hearts of every living being that's where it's meant to go
 and what the Tennessee is there our weakness our human weakness right is that we begin to see that Temple Worship in our own sectarian way we become proud of what we're doing we
it makes us better than other people
 edit you know it in this way it doesn't serve the purpose so the last text text 40 was warning about this kind of mentality and kind of showing the the
 futility of it by saying someone sometimes a neophyte devotee someone who's not well
 evolved as in Buckley yoga offers all the paraphernalia for worshiping the Lord in the temple and if actually worships the Lord as the DD but because he is envious and we we you know we find the Crock-Pot when he uses this word envious is likely using it in a bit of an archaic sense but we can say because he has animosity
 towards the devotees of the Lord Vishnu the Lord is never satisfied with his devotional service so it's like you're doing all this external stuff but Gods like I'm not interested
that external sucks so much that external service to bring you to to love me and to love everyone so it's like it's kind of meaningless and when we read that verse from from early in the Box on the said it's kind of like pouring Gyan to ashes and so you know instead of into a sacrificial fire is kind of like a did there's no meaning to it has no
 efficacy to it and so these last versus will continue in this vein
 ideal fatly I feel like I could write a book a modern version of Ideal family life of everything I did right and every failure I've had ideal family life sometimes less than ideal family life what's real that would be a very interesting book right now they think you'd have a lot to share their it is because you know we have all these standards of
how living ideal family life and then we have a modern-day issues we have you got a chance to practice and Krishna box kids here is very inspiring getting raised as a devotee challenges cuz then you bring these kids into the material world as they get older and they're trying to find themselves and how they fit in and then we're trying to bring other than we get in later in life we already have maybe a teenager how do you bring that teenager into a spiritual at these are these are all like challenges we Face nowadays that we deal with the whole nother culture
 you don't that may be very very foreign to us from the clothing to the haircuts to the to the worship to the practices of worship and incense and yeah this is
there's almost needs to be volume some. We do on the show we talk about this stuff especially in our questions and answers day and we do
 tell question of taking the essence of it right and trying to see how that comes alive how good you know yeah
 how to cast this to text 41 my dear king of all persons a qualified brahmana must be accepted as the best within this material world because such brahmana they're practicing austerity Vedic studies and satisfaction becomes the counterpart body of the Supreme personality of God has a lot of worship to the renounce
 spiritually educated devotional people why because they have the direct Society they're the ones he's look up to they're the ones you inquire from and and because
 when it says is it's an interesting way that is phrased here
they become the counter counterpart body of God and other than that you know again so much of this is driving us it's this Bobby time just again and again it's saying don't get stuck
 on this lower level of religious thought
 right cuz all of that external traditional stuff it has value if it's moving forward but if you think that's the end then you're stuck in something that superficial and where it's meant to go is that you're seeing God everywhere see God working through everything you're seeing God present in everyone and in particular that brahmana it's and now here's we're not talking about some qualified it says qualified Brahmin right not someone that's a Brahmin to just facetimed birth it was born in brown a family to know someone that's through the is here saying through the practice was sturdy and Vedic studies and satisfaction
I think my satisfaction we can understand that it sound contentment and I got someone who's learned to be content simply someone who study The Vedic teachings and really understood the body and an end are inviting them
 did someone who's always steer it means that they have no monetary interest that's influencing the clarity of thought
 that that person
 we should we God can God's message you know God's energy God's presence can work through them
 and therefore
 more important than worshipping the deed in a temple is the respect to this person or you could say the word should I use the word worship right and I I looked up the word worship broken her word dictionary word nerd or a nerd how you're the word nerd so I thought this would satisfy that might interest you so worship and end
there's two definitions here I read the second definition first cuz I think that's where I mind usually goes when we think of the word worship
 and that is the axe or rights that make up a formal expression of reverence for deity a religious ceremony or ceremonies I think that's what we think of as I think abortion is okay but the first definition is this the feeling or expression
 of reverence and admiration for DT feeling or expression of reverence or adoration and so if someone would say like you know what maybe there's some interesting stuff here but his worship stuff I don't know and worshiping God and and what's your worst team in another person no way but will I think I don't know if there's any of us that can say that within our hearts we do
Pele
 a type of reverence or adoration for someone
 you know and that we find different ways of expressing it in other ways according to this definition you know it like if if you go to you know whatever Taylor Swift concert and in you get all excited and you cheer when when she walks out the stage like it you know any begin to express your adoration you know verbally and physically and so on that is worship
 and so we're all worshiping we all have feelings and expressions of of reverence and adoration where are they directed
 and here were saying if you can direct it towards the root of all existence you're going to find the best results but don't you just superficially to a figure in a temple
 try to
deeper the one that's really feeling it is going to see it in in people and they'll find that qualified person
 and that Reverend said they might be showing might be diverting towards the Rockstar or they athlete or the politician or you know whatever the model or they do it whatever they might be headed the celebrity of some sort rather than that
 powerful energy being diverted to a less Worthy
 you know object
 that you can bring it to a person that has that that that the energy God is really flowing through you know and
 that's the way that you keep your mind in the right place and keep your heart in the right place and evolve it's so interesting how worship is a meditation and that we all have objects of meditation that are not necessarily the Supreme person that little
meditating while we're sitting on legs and abs and hair and beards and boobs and cars and in a people's a property do you think people are meditating on your beard I say you won't even believe it
 nice beard
 I was trying to pick me up or something nice beard man if he did you thought he was like being sarcastic at first but I don't think he was trying to get my attention like that I think January
Haitian I'm meditating on your beard sir I'm worshipping your beers similar to yours is Cars Cars by Craig Chapple that's my new book what is your object how can I make some meditation and it's where Consciousness goes you don't they say the resting phase hey look at his resting place it's a resting my mind bass expression came from here to talk about resting face like I'm just sitting there are you looking for a looking happier
 like your default emotional fall face are BF what does that mean these words are you there I'm lost I'm not resting B face okay I got it
soften directed towards women because I get like that. That always in that okay now I understand anyway where is a resting mind what is it what is it mean what if we traded to go as a training potty face what's are resting foxy face at night where is it go to what will be the last thought as we leave our body we could think about that what what is your thoughts when things are going miserable up in your life where is that place is such a good topic cuz if we we have a choice that we could either just let that operate as the world as the Winds of the world blow it
or we could decide know I'm going to direct it I'm going to be the captain of this boat and I'm going to adjust the sails and indirect my mind my resting mind to where I want to go and that's what this regulation and you always all about right and it's so funny because the guy complimenting my beard and we said something like resting bhakti face on like that and so then Professor Snooki board goes that's a good shirt talking about my shirt back thanks but then I realized she was just saying like that phrase would be a good t-shirt that's what I thought it was, I'm at bog enough morning that's what I thought was going on here we can have them at you little bit more if you like a rocking off before I sent thanks I realize like oh I get it she's not
what about my particular shirt today okay Henry thank you a good point here is is is my resting bacta is my resting mind is it looking for validation on a regular basis like what do they think about me what'd they think about me what they think about me what she think about me you think I'm cool do they think I'm except what do I think about myself where is our mind look or all the millions of places are mine can go except to the form of the Supreme personality of godhead
 buck and wood boxes as soon as it's not that we just have to root out all the distractions but that we we can actually just let them I be attracted to something else in the end that the forces that
Polo sport in our yoga practice which is otherwise so difficult I was thinking just like we were talking about like it's it actually is a type of worship that we have
 for other beings and you know you could imagine if I could be taken order a person
 and they got the regular please play The Message Board Play you're trying they're going out of their way to do it is your initial childish response how many childish response is where we get your bouquet blame it on how many do we have to get from you know you take a look at famous song go and and then let's say you take a fan of
Taylor Swift is really into her and say they just like what's up man you know the head of the Swifty fan club and and you drop them off and say like they said we're going to drop you off and Taylor Swift's home
 yeah you guys spend the weekend there
 Taylor Swift paraphernalia yeah and incident if there be like wow this is like a credible like I'm in Taylor Swift's house and there is her this and the oh my God she must this is where she cooks her meals are this is where she sleeps to this when she does this or that and and they would walk around in that home in what sense is just a home full of stuff maybe that I can expensive home or large home or something like that but probably got a television over here in this bed over there and it's couch over there and there's nothing unique that unique about it right but but for her unique it's like
okay that they're saying is reminding them of Taylor Swift
 and they're probably also thinking let me be careful not to do it here like nothing like drop anything or break anything cuz this is all Taylor Swift's you know right and I love Taylor Swift and you know and that's kind of like the way that the the Bacio is moving through this world is like this is all the energy of God I'm sure it's not just in his Temple but by cultivating the attitude in the temple I'm moving to the whole world
 that's where you're going with this analogy that's a great analogy okay hold different country different different place different ocean was
Why by worshiping Taylor Swift you got to go to her home once you get to go to her home and once you get to know her generally these things it doesn't live up to all you expected it to live up to
 that's awesome because we tend to worship false gods that's a lot of things there's not worship of false god just false ideas that goes to our mind goes to Lusty images are mine goes two things of this world that we think will make us happy it will go to all of his eyes concept of greed it will go to you know stockpiling well but do those things actually give the heart what it wants so my my my my I thought you were going okay with this person and we get there was like a big deal when you worship
 when you worship
great souls to give Enlightenment as well as a Super Saiyan God had there's actually tangible reciprocation stuff together let's tie them together so then these two great analogies together as well like chocolate and peanut butter great things that go great together so so this is the idea that the mature about the Oogie right or let's just say the evolved spiritualist in general
 this is the real saint that they're they're moving through this world
 and they're so sitting everything in it with God is everything in it is reminding them of God so they're kind of like a gentle soul in one we just like that person may be gentle moving through Taylor Swift's home they want to be careful all I don't want to you know make a stain on her white couch or do you know cuz it's something like that you know her on a carpet or something like that cuz it'll be like oh that creep it ended up in my house and just didn't respect it
no it's like you know I love God and I see everything that I see tree meizu God just like you know this couch reminds me Taylor Swift get your minds with no tree reminds me of of God all the human being reminds you got animal reminds me of God River reminds me of God it's got me in this God Consciousness everywhere I turn I'm seeing the presence of God I'm seeing God in the presence of human beings and when I see a qualified brahmana someone who's really got the energy of God flowing through them without it being diverted in so many different ways I respect that or you could say I worship that is so the householders are finding those people and taking their energy rather than worshipping
 so many other less worthy objects of their their meditation or the focus they bring it there and it's uplifting is purifying it satisfying it's it's it's powerful
 I like that good job your Weaver
leaving those two and Alex's together as one and it kind of you concluded with this final verse of the chapter let's do it let's wrap this up in style right in time my dear King yudhistira the brahmas especially those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord throughout the entire world was that a pro pod Indulgence right there in the Sanskrit with will you look at the Sands but I'll finish reading it and then you tell me my dear King yudhistira the Brahmin is especially those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord throughout the entire world are recognized and worshipped by the Supreme personality of God flipping it God worship God has feelings of admiration for them in his heart an Express is it who is the person who got who is in the heart and who is the heart and soul of all creation
 okay so now
the brahmas by their preaching sanctify the three worlds with the dust of their Lotus feet and us they work they are washable you know I heard that Krishna 18 of the famous story about Krishna eating the dirt and one of the ordinary is I can't remember who said Krishna is eating the dirt because he wants the dust of the feet of the bridge when David of their endowment residents here
 so I would Sanskrit spend it what did you find out what I found on the way that I would understand that like another was the verse probably more simply reads that my dear can use to the brahmas
 and then probably kind of ads especially those engaged in preaching the glories of Lord throughout the entire world
 and maybe we go back to the previous verse where it's talking about this person disqualified themselves through austerity Vedic studies and contentment
I suppose you know there's probably stretching do you know there's okay The Vedic studies they're expressing them to people are how do you know it if they're not speaking it and so you know especially those that are sacrificing to kind of help others soon I wanted to serve others in this way so yeah I think you're right about that but yeah interesting here right let's see it again the Brahmin is especially those engaged in preaching the glory floor throughout the entire world are recognized recognize check and their warships right by the Supreme personality you got it so like why should you hesitate
 Ted 2 to worship them to to have to hold feelings of of adoration in your heart for them
 an end because he's the heart and soul of all creation the word is Juggernaut Mama Soul of the universe the hot mama of the universe it's a very meaningful concept you know
not just a poetic thing but it's like just as our souls Consciousness has spread throughout our body the universe is his body and is Lord Vishnu his his Consciousness has spread throughout the entire universe and that being enters the heart of every living being and worships himself those types of people those promise The Promise by the preachings they sanctify the three worlds Wheeling.
