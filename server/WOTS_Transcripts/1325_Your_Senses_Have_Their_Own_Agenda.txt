yeah get it ready everyone is nothing here who is in this evening because Steve has spent the night in the Airstream last night how is that peaceful quiet is good I've been sleeping in New York City to my apartment to but it was so cuz your apartment face for the back of the building if you're facing the front it's a little louder yeah it's but peaceful compared to the gym
 oh yeah he was saying yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bring them up let's get over here talk to your real okay. It'll be here
he lived in the LA Temple for 2 months in the Brahma Cherry Ostrom if you know it wasn't a perfect fit so we came out to the wisdom of the ages Retreat and he's going to stay around here for a couple weeks what's your story where you from I'm from South Texas at the bottom Brownsville and recently I'm on account of the new Krishna somewhere she ride because of the moment I left Brownsville eight months ago to do a little film gagan Fort Worth you're a filmmaker and it was due for me to get a car crash this year actually my chart and so I was like really paranoid I'm trying my best not to get in one did you go to work and I was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic actually listening to surrender by John David Harrison in Willow okay well it happened I try my best to escape it but what you're in bumper-to-bumper traffic and someone slammed into
I thought he was a really kind soul because he was letting everyone virgin he was way behind everyone and I thought I was just super nice but then I looked in my rearview mirror and I see that he's 35 mph right at me and why you were parked yeah I've got nowhere else to go out right what is literally when I was listening to surrender by John Peterson okay I'm really hurt I wasn't actually my car was my car got totaled and I was kind of stranded out there for a little while we're on where you are already into boxing at this point I was this was
 okay well probably just be listening to or not understanding this is the path to God that was that was three months ago and I am okay and I am I would kind of stranded up there and thanks to the great Souls at Krishna House Dallas they kind of sheltered me for a month
nice and then and then after that I just kind of ping pong the right towards La and then I've been in the eliasch from such lovely Souls there and then now I'm ping pong the other side of the coast and I'm so grateful to say I've been a fan of the show for over a year did Joe Rogan podcast actually yes and I was listening for days on end just racked up over 10,000 minutes and we can do something like that ten thousand and I it's just a blessing to be here and I'm so grateful we like yeah yeah I will talk to you real soon you will meet him if you can tell he said that early Krishna Consciousness full-on ballistic right now yeah
the truth all right the ten year old from Lebanon is chastising me on the message board Raghu started growing some air and his head Rodger should shave bacta leader this ten-year-old from Lebanon is it would give it a try so I'm like trying it a little bit but I don't think it's going to work at 1 10 year old over here telling you one thing I know to bring them over there with her announcements and we're now so that means you still there gone and Mara are going to India for Autumn we're going to a bunch of 10 holy places that we love if you're interested in the traveling of sacred Indian not as a Backpacker known as a tourist but to experience India like a pilgrim very nice trips and wonderful trip it's a game change
go to my website real good enough. Yoga and gets all the information is not on wasn't sage.com I don't do that website I went back to Recovery Group meetings at 12:30 and 1 today eastern time and cost of Kane's Asana class Feel Good Friday with Josh came 10:30 a patron numbers thank you thank you
 nope I was looking at you lovingly while you were preparing it account to find out if you can make it to try to make this easy for cuz it's a this is a poem
 okay and it's by Yeats Heats and it's hard to read I think but
 I kind of laid it out here so I think you can make it easier for you and you run your sailing too busy busy
damn I feel like a bison team maybe I think it's bism to him so you if you read it just like the way it's laid out here like that it's going to make it easier cuz otherwise you can do this instead of a dramatic that is No Country for Old Men the young in one another's arms birds in the trees those dying Generations at their song the Salmon Falls the mackerel crowded sees or foul commend All Summer Long whatever is begotten born
 guys whatever is begotten born and Dives caught in that sensual music all neglect monuments of an aging until a select is that it or you want me to read the whole thing is just that special.
that is No Country for Old Men that young in one another's arms that is No Country for Old Men so it's like this world isn't a good place for the old Rochester it might be when you're young and everything in might be like all this if it's a great world and I told her at least from if you're operating on that
 seeing the point of life is since gratification trying to find happiness through external as you get older that when do classes that window closes it gets tougher to enjoy our sexual experiences as our senses become weaker but then you know the young in one another's arms they're not feeling it they're not you know they're caught up birds in the trees in generations and generations after song is that mean it means that that they're unaware of
immortality right there singing the birds are singing away the young that you know they're in each other's arms to embrace one another and you know enjoying the that the pleasures of this world unaware of the the the undeniable truth
 that's you know who they're going to they're going to be like the old man soon good morning everybody so it's a world word world crowded with fish flesh or fowl this special for so many different kind of living entities and if we look at them and we look at their lives then we can seek the commend All Summer Long even though they're enjoying we can see that something's being said that whatever is begotten or nand. Everything is this phone is going to die and we just have to look we just had to see this everywhere but then this is the part I think this is that this Lass
mine is the real you don't caught in that sensual music all neglect
 monuments of an aging intellect he's sailing to Byzantium he's going to wear the sages with whether these great philosophers do you know that there were there from he wants to contemplate these monuments of an aging intellect and we're all aging this knowledge never ages write this knowledge stays steady it's what were meant to kind of reach out to its dissolution right otherwise you know who called in the Central Music and we're neglecting the wisdom of the sages not a feel-good hot but it is recognized as we'd like to say sometimes right when we look at this world yet you might hear this is his people been saying the stuff
because I particularly want to come to the bhakti it look like from the Guiana yoga path you might there be like yes yes yes and instead we really have a very positive colorful alternative right so we can look at this world with two eyes with one pessimistic I trying to find happiness to externals in the temporary world as never changing Souls trying to find satisfaction to the ever-changing world will not be successful that's a pessimistic I listen here out how I flip it this is how I feel but I do if I could continue this point if we don't have that pessimistic I would get a very unbalanced if you and we suffer because of it okay let's hear. I just I just go right into the flipped version and I sell you a material world we're here to enjoy
but there's a different type of enjoyment we are born to enjoy in this material world because the soul is by nature enjoyable we want to enjoy we are anyway but how do you do it we have the recipe isn't all positive who can argue with that. But that you're enjoying the wrong way there's actually a way to enjoy your ways going to cheat you out of enjoyment but here's the problem with that Robin is that
 if we don't hear to some degree
 if we do get a little bit of that bitter pill and we don't hear about the problems of material existence
 we're likely not we're likely to keep reaching out to it likely that you're not going to come and join us and join what you're thinking about
I pinch but you welcome them in the door by say who's that's good
 there's one there's one verse that sing
 something sukham tsukai to write something about the universe is all it's all enjoy it's all enjoyable from the right perspective it's all enjoyable life is a beach but but but I understand correctly that line at the end
 about that part in the central music all neglect
 monuments of on Aging intellect or something there's a thread that runs through it all that's he's finding it in the stoic philosophers sure we're reaching out you do we can we can
find it and in so many other of wisdom Traditions we're drawing today from The Truman Baga time perhaps the oldest you know known him since we're here and into the mouth of this little boy for a lot but he's going to be telling me he's going to be saying some he's standing in front of Lord Vishnu everything is going great and in his life right now right now and just wiped out his father who was like trying to torture him and kill him in so many ways it's bad he's he's about to be offered any desire that he has right whatever you want take it it's yours measurement came to you personally are you Linda would imagine that guy can be personally funky God can be personally whatever you want you're so good recognizing all your good qualities you're so good you can have whatever you want
 and hear what prologue says here that today but that that's definitely come but
my point is all the day of his all the the universal powerful figures are also there and he is the one that is getting all the recognition all the praise he's being offered whatever he wants and yet he when he speaks he first we just heard versus worries glorifying Lord Vishnu and how he's behind the entire universe and how we can be perceived through meditation that you can see what others can't see that I see that you're everywhere you're the every strata of existence your present your awareness is there your your loving awareness is there so so in that sense everything is good but he's going to begin to speak that you know what I feel for the people that are suffering in this world
 you know he's not he's not just saying all my got everything I wanted. Now he said I'm feeling for the people that stuff in this world it's a hard world this is No Country for Old Men this is a place where you know unless we connect with that how did he phrase it again with
Adam that
 does monuments have been changing into like the less we unless we hear the truth and understand the truth we're destined to suffer in these mortal frames right and it so he speaks with real competitor it may sound like a bitter pill what he sang
 but he sang it out of compassion
 you ever pray for material things and try not to not really sometimes study prayers up your body because sometimes I pray for my kids well in what context I'll pray for them like this morning when I woke up I was praying for my kids at pray for their deep connection to God cuz I'm paying for material thing
 and their health and happiness
and material yeah it's it goes back and forth that I just feel then sometimes I'll be like oh my God knows what I want a deeper level of awareness you hit a motorcyclist supposed to do I don't know so I just pray I just connected this that's what you thought that's the highest thing is really almost like there's really nothing to pray for anymore its just like you know what the you know what I want Krishna. Just offering my prayers to you you can glorify God said let those words that's what I mean I'm just like he was going to offer prayers to you and whatever happens this is what the Prairie when they pray for something and we seen about together praying may I never forget you may always made my mind always
absorbed in you like that what's the weather be today this morning when I woke up it was a direct message of a friend of mine and I don't know if this person into bhakti but she definitely likes Sonata and Dharma and you know Vedic cultural shift so you want to get I'm getting married do you recommend any priests who could marry me to help me counteract Bad Karma and whatever the you know The Vedic rituals are come to you for all kinds of all kinds of help I can help you to use got to come in a submissive mood well if I ever asked for it so she asked Can you help me find a good priest if you if you have somebody I said people you know I do a lot of pujari is hoodoo priests but sometimes they
 you don't talk to you there's so many so many times we the ritual is second to the bhakti and there are people that you know that the bridge was obviously second and then sometimes they're the ritual is primer
in the bhakti secondary so all out I'm going to tell you is all I can recommend is someone who's got bhakti at the Forefront and the girls like you if you're really into astrology when it's like bounce out some Olympic plan instead of happy marriage we're not into necessarily happy marriage we're not praying for happy marriages were we're praying for evolution and sometimes it takes a little pain to evolve we're not praying to get rid of my bad karma we're praying give me a devotion and that could manifest in a lot of ways you can manifest in the season of Good Karma and the season of like losing it all
 and then maybe getting a little bit back whatever it is we're praying for our Evolution May hold on to the lifeline through all the storms and good weather maybe you should be the priest for this right now
are you ready to get in there I am, which is every means of Conquest when should offer respectfully Basin cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on tuner and reshoot the Super Bowl human being until another star Swati the goddess of learning and it's really Austin Dave the author messed up right now. Body is all that is troublesome to a heart will become erratic ated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who has praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact, tell Miranda Sia
knowledge I offer now Bay since he's at their load of speed-reading for the shoeboxes Tom Canto 7 chapter 9 text I think it's actually 40th we can get this thing over there I like the way you and I chat together like that we sound like we should be doing the wedding together that was right but how do you help us and we go where do you want in front of my face just kind of condense it like that I put it in front of your face so I can't sit here
 this around the country she said the synchronization was on point I think by the second one we started looking as I realize I could change them like when I'm with you then I can change it to the mic sound when I'm when I'm with you I Can chant to when I'm with you everything's better OK Google
position is like that of a person who has many wives all trying to attract him in their own way for example who would who do you think the other senses was your famous in two different people try to get your attention
 my position is like that of a person with many wives while trying to attract him in their own way there's ample the tongue is attracted to palatable dishes on demand on demand
 the genitals to sex with another demand
 with an attractive sex with an attractive woman
 monkey climb up please
sense of touch to contact with soft things rabbits getting the Sheep
 the belly although filled this is me still wants to eat more this way to do you make an incredible dinner will be a so satisfying to be like now I want a second dinner I just like to scour through the refrigerator for other things I make a sandwich after that delicious dinner a ad but this is me right in the belly of a field still wants to eat more and the ear not attempting to hear about you my lord is generally attracted to Proud pie Dad's this little translation Cinema songs I don't think they were Cinema songs in the year - thousands why not
is there a version of Cinema during the time of prolonged Mirage you know that for a fact yes I do to you yeah I can tell you who invented you sure they didn't have it before they just catching up
 yeah we don't know I'm just playing with you
 the sense of smell is attracted to yet another side the Restless eyes are attracted to scenes of sense gratification Sunset as a scene of some sense gratification
 an act of senses are attracted elsewhere in this way I'm certainly embarrassed you don't know what I think about when I think of this one I think of the ears
 you're attracted to they're not attracted to hearing about Krishna they're attracted to hear about everything else whatever is on your list of the most-played YouTube videos that's what you're attracted to
do your ears are everybody's here's what I'm just saying you know how you go to your history and it says all the videos you been playing how many of those are Krishna conscious
 let's check your thing right now and find out I will say that a great Soul teacher of mine said if you ever want to get rid of somebody
 at riverdene about meeting someone at the kill them I mean if someone's like talking your ear off bothering you you just say hey I'm glad you're here I was about to read the chase honeychurch a great. Let's read together and if they're attracted to speaking and hearing nonsense or just Monday and things when you say let's read something Transit that do they'll be like oh I got to go and it gets rid of them
 is that a bad thing so you're saying that it's natural that are yours going to track it to the external things
but it's what we're we're actually in the same way people getting addicted to alcohol we are addicted to hearing about the mundane
 and in that Monday maybe in the Rogers and Thomas but he also may be in the form of videos I watch
 but it's a lot saying that you know a lot of us might think as long as our desires are getting fulfilled some weight it's this whole sensual thing is positive it's like what a great world we have sent to the connect with objects can be derived pleasure is a good thing he's saying No this is a problem cuz they're dragging me and directions that promise pleasure but ultimately deliver pain it died I pulled up something there's an article written by ravindra Trooper both
 brilliant philosopher read genius what we wrote it insert for a shelter records you know
didn't know that he wrote some I should read it one day it's very cool what was his team
 sort of like a very beautiful poetic way of saying you're not the body okay but we get a single called in defense of reality and the insert was written by a super cool lunch pull it up for her show sometimes they would be in this is that he wrote a paper called an essay in pathology always called since graduation an essay and pathology pathology mean it means like some human beings like some kind of irrational
 problematic low-income captivated by something like that has on it the study of the essential nature of diseases or sit disease right and especially of the structural and functional changes produced by then something at
normal
 but deviation for propriety or from an assumed normal stage
 deviation given rise to social ills is a deviation giving rise to social ills or I think personally holds here and is it a way that he's describing it he says I just took a little part of it
 hit any he's kind of showing the mindset of the materialist kind of a lot of people argue you know that whether it's articulated or not it may be kind of the assumed default kind of way that we operate why then should we see those traditional religions immoralities which which he eats his calling monuments of what he called it to the other side I must listen to what I just said so it so why should we then he those traditional religious immoralities
 with their negations and restriction
Hoes by those decrepit use hating life denying Patriarchs their lips curled in disgust there is such a thing as progress it has liberated us from the guilt and Innovations inherited from the past let us fully explore and exploit all the potentials of the world so the illusion grows deeper with Emma Talley the illusion grows deeper lays the very Foundation of our modern culture
 it's it's it's it's it's a we we built a culture on this kind of denial of the Timeless wisdom that's that's always been there we're we're we're laying out a path that we think is a path of happiness
 but if we usually put all these wise people it's it's we we in our minds and granted there are you know life denying use hating to crap it you know Patriarchs out there yes but there's also a hole
traditions of just insightful people that could do that that's scratched just a little bit beneath the veneer you know material of material happiness yeah it's not like they're all bitter at you while you get to enjoy we don't and they have it there sour grapes is there actually insightful yes sometimes people are very excited that young ages and then he was under such an oppressive circumstance but he was happy it was dancing around with his friends and no matter what negative energy is being thrown at him he was drunk he was in some old lip-curling like that I patriarch he was like a sweet boy sweet little boy Shirley had inside
 so he's saying all this that this the power of the senses which you do you start to wake up and use the same. This is great if he's seen the power that is just like it's like I'm being pulled in all this
directions by by someone that has their own agenda in my own agenda it's making me incapable of carrying out what's what's in my own best interest interesting to your senses have an agenda for you they want they want their own gratification and not too concerned about you besides squirrel people can Google search for how I was saved from being saved by ravindra swarup Abu rub engines great great essay OK Google. It's right next to you 41 my dear Lord You Are Always Transit until they situated on the other side of the river of death
 we're not talking about a creek
 and I were talking about a big Ripper big Hudson River it's hard to cry we're on the side where the death side
 what's the weather in the lifestyle
we're not alive right now and it's a hard swim to get over to that other son
 that because of the reactions of your own activities we are suffering in this side of our own activities indeed okay I got the ocean my dear Lord You Are Always Transit and Ali situated on the other side of the river of death okay we are in the river of death we have to cross that River to get to the River of Life to get another rivers of the delay hands slower River and repeatedly suffering the Pains of birth and death and eating orrible things
 look around
 natureismetal not me Instagram page all kind of horrible food animals eating other animal crocodile that got some
Intermountain 290 yeah you know I've been watching a lot lately up is those recalls Komodo dragons eat Chomp meat eating lizards hate them you know we see Hogs horrible diet dogs my God the stuff they eat it's like you can be here you got to let that go though you'll just love them anyway not to love them
 what is saying we've we all pass through all these bodies and we just getting ourselves as hardheaded things but also upon all others who are suffering and buy your causeless mercy and compassion
 Deliver Us and maintain us okay so now we begin to you know prela is known for his compassion right that's like one of the features one of his major feed he was
this being so pressed but he didn't even have it in his own mind like his his own hell yeah it was like help everyone everyone everyone that operate yeah I'm I'm fine it's just through me you just threw me into a pit of snakes but help everyone else
 you know who he wasn't cheat on you Lila yeah he was wore it right now maybe hurt me I may be a little bit of both and her and varsity. It was he was just like let me take on the Bad Karma of every living being right let me suffer any there's a lot of that was a very big prayer let me take on the Bad Karma of everyone let me suffer do you know what people do unlimited bastard a duck have you been living in the Bible where people don't do anything bad he was just another level of Consciousness completely you have to be Karma Mussolini's Karma come on
so many people
 oh pot hold
 Epstein's Island, the entire world what's the difficulty for you who manage the Affairs of the universe in delivering the Fallen Souls engaged in your devotional service that is easy for you you are the friend of all suffering humanity and for great personalities it is necessary to show Mercy to the foolish therefore I think that you'll show your cause as Mercy two persons like us to engage and your service is come on out best of a great personalities I am not at all afraid of material existence is a big one for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in the thoughts of your glorious
activities my concern is only for the fools and Rascals were making elaborate plans for material happiness right plan for material happiness again and maintaining their family societies and countries I am simply concerned with love for them so he's responsible though maintaining you know making making up making a plan for happiness for your family so that's so bad cuz you know that's not taking my kids to Italy with me on this on this little Retreat we're doing that's so bad while what's your purpose in bringing them their Tino to bond with them to connect with them to have a Little Krishna conscious experience and a beautiful place that the point is there's nothing is absolute to make begin gelato out there this is absolutely nothing wrong with bonding with the kids
 that's my buddy that's all that a parent can offer them
and it's really just people trying to enjoy this world through each other and it's a an ultimately sir it's a recipe for suffering sure whereas if you can help one another transcend realize experience and actually taste
 a spiritual reality that's beyond material enjoyment that if if if as a group you can all help each other understand that the deeper happiest this is not found through external things right it's that there's it happens that we all have our nature within us all that's in connection with god let's help each other discovered that he's pointing them towards that otherwise we're enjoying something that's going to disappear quick and we're all going to suffer that's it and we're going to stay stuck in a cycle like this you know so it's so there's nothing wrong with that with with with with bonding with your family's good thing okay but if that's but there's something more that that brings it to an entirely different level
that's what he's trying to
 I feel for them that they're working hard to maintain their families to maintain their societies to maintain the country's but they're missing the bigger point I just can't miss the bigger point
 make it is concerned with love for them not condemning them thank you for scaring validating my vacation
 no vacation you hang out with kids so vacation
 o Krishna
 my dear Lord is trying to Dave I see that there are many saintly persons indeed but they are interested only in their own Deliverance cuz so they're even people that are catching on to this was a deeper spiritual please deliver me Lord yeah they're they're only concerned with their own deliveries are not thinking about it but I can't think like I can't just achieved my own spiritual happiness and neglect everybody else's how can I do that
 here's how he
not caring for big cities and towns they go to the Himalayas with a forest to meditate with boughs of Silence mountain of Recca on a Beretta
 Matt mares encouraging me to do a bow of Silence from my spiritual I think she wants it for Spiritual out of your problem is if I don't talk Mara will not talk they will be so gloomy feed the holes the whole household will be silent
 I was sent here to entertain you Mara I know that without Krishna Consciousness without taking shelter of your Lotus feet one could hold a hold of they're not interested in delivering others the Moana brought those people ask for me however I do not wish to be liberated alone on this is it this is our sankertown thing as for me I do not wish to be liberated alone leaving aside all these poor fools and rice
I know that without Krishna Consciousness without taking shelter of your Lotus feet one cannot be happy there for I wish to bring them back to shelter of your Lotus feet that's our mood that's why I moved here a wisdom the sage shall like it, Don it give the stuff away to other people I know that as far as me however I do not wish to be liberated alone leaving aside all these poor fools and Rascals that's not saying I'm above it I'm a full Rascal to we're trying to get out of this we're trying to reach out extended her hand and get as many people out of material Consciousness as possible this is how we change the world with spiritual Solutions therefore I wish to bring them back to the shelter of your Lotus feet my Lord
 that without bringing them back to the shelter to those feet but cannot be happy there for we spend the night okay grace you want to hear this get rich
get ready people
 sex life
 he said that like a lip-curling life denying patriarch now I'm just trying to get their attention
 is compared to the rubbing of two hands to relieve an itch just like Mara just got poison ivy he didn't say it's like the most sinful so I can write what is sex like it's a desire of a look at him look at them look at all of that look at all of us
 yeah it's it's a it's a desire it's, it's desire I want how can I enjoy them why is it called a different bar twice compared to Niche niche
feels good to scratch the itch until you stop
 it doesn't satisfy an itch that makes it out work right or eating them I sometimes get some allergy where I have to rub my eyes and you just keep rubbing in the eye gets redder and redder and redder and it doesn't go away with Robert the more you need to run more you need to rub it and so that's what they're saying this desire for sexual enjoyment is not like an evil what it does is it's like scratching an itch
 exacerbates it's not like now it's gone know it goes like blowing on a flame when you blow in a fire to stoke it you blow on it and fire goes down and then goes back higher that's what it cuz it does good way for a moment and now you're thinking everything with the sexual goggles on
sexual goggles know it gets really itchy and that's crazy and you're realizing that damaging myself here while you could actually damage yourself and little kids sometimes they wrap it so it's there mosquitoes bites and I'll leave little scabs on the right and sometimes just the way that you actually get past it is you just have to engage your mind elsewhere you just have to neglect it you just have to ignore it like sometimes if you got like you stubbed your toe and things really really hurt but then someone makes you laugh and they're laughing laughing laughing you're laughing cuz I'm joking around and you forgot that you hurt your toe
 yeah 11 since we're engaging our senses and other things it negates the itch but what happens is
it goes down by neglect also if we write exactly goes with a flare up again when he was short so whatever the other day and it had it was it was illustrating it was showing two kids two little kids like like even babies real little very little or eat what I think one was like a little baby and one was like a really loud maybe like a two-year-old her 1-year life and was like 21 year olds and they showed that first one to show the father have the little baby in his hands in his arms and he was close to the wall and he moved towards the wall and he didn't hit the walk he hit the wall with his fists and then he responded as if the baby's head it at the wall
 so the baby's head never hit anything but he will attend us at all are you okay are you alright
as if it's headed hitting and then there was another one weird like to kid acting a little kid actually felt kind of like hard and you fell out of the package and you could win to react if we have waiting do I cried and and another in the mother just came and said oh look at you so how we respond to the different pitches or even the different types of suffering it has a lot to just do with our mindset whether it's it's as a miserable I know as amongst people tell us like you're in your twenties but you crazy you're impressing all your guys could you do that you know what our minds were engaged you know we had a mission in life but we were our intellect was engaged by by people that we admire that was sharing all kinds of insights in the life we have work to do in the world we had a mission with you know that kept us engaged
work there was you know there was music there was food but with all our stuff in compromising positions also put ourselves in even if you do have like no this is wrong if you put yourself in a compromised position you're setting yourself up for disaster so it was a beautiful yogic path what kind of laid out and it just care that's right through ya and then the trainee kind of stays with you as you as you have passed through life only read the first student part of the hitch part right oh yeah yeah let's start from the top is compared to the rubbing of two hands to relieve a niche greehey mateys the so-called Greenhouse Dental Group in Romania is a householder that's actually engage incense ratification where's agree hasta is a householder that are living like in a few spiritualists
380 means their life is centered around material enjoyment when the setting of The the Greyhound home so greet the so-called Greenhouse does have no spiritual knowledge think that this itching is the greatest platform of happiness is obviously not because they're always like how can we like how can we make it better I like you're saying I believe bring it back the way it used to be on the old days out can we get up because you're not an illusion anymore
 it on the romance is been punctured remember you sharing that story about this you were on tour with his band in the lead singer was like really popular names is that you like it was super popular but it was pretty popular they had a big hit that I hit they had a hit and he was a hunk you would look really handsome guy he was a hunk and he's just and so but he was confiding in me people confide in me
still come to the invited me and he said you know
 he didn't mention any names like what is a hunk like a very attractive looking man is more masculine and what's a few times that woman's a hunk and what does confide in and what does confided mean confided means they came to you for advice it came to me yeah and so is sad
 you know it's like all these women like throw themselves at me after a show and I can't stop myself and I hate myself immediately afterwards and I swear I'll never do it again and the next night it happens again and I don't know what to do. You could tell the person was broken almost like an alcoholic L like
I got to stop but I can't stop I'm gratify my senses and but my goal is is miserable yeah yeah and it's this place of like
 almost like sober intoxication where you have intelligence you're not liking it, you're actually suffering cuz you're thoughtful and and he was very thoughtful guy and but he couldn't I don't know how it ever worked out for him but it's a perfect example of in this context in the sexual contact they were speaking of yeah that his senses are pulling him this way right and and he's he's so weak he can't get it under control even though he really he's so nice he was living what a lot of guys can't even last for all the happiness has yeah it's like this
consuming that Mike there a thing if I can only get her and so yeah he's he's actually living your dream and suffering that crazy and suffering my crazy getting that dream fulfilled
 sorry karuna
 Indian gentleman in the back
 those who are dear hell did you skip the other part to the creeping us that's another time to read the whole thing that's going to be leaving H The Greene he made he's the so-called great hostas with no spiritual knowledge think that this itching is the greatest platform of Happiness although actually to sort of distress if you think is the greatest form of Happiness you're an illusion and here's the truth it's the greatest form of the stress
is a fool a miser we're just the opposite of the Brahmin us right in the Brahman is learn how to be happy with nothing that's what a real Brahmin is there detach from stuff so the creeping us were thinking I got to get stuff
 they are not satisfied by repeated sense enjoyment those who are dear or however who are sober and it worked out and who tolerate this itching are not subject subjected subjected to the sufferings of Fools and Rascals very and so there's so there's two different things if you go back even though you feel like
 I can't stop myself and I'm good but I'm going to do it again tomorrow your full but if you're actually like not this is great this is great I love doing this you're just a rascal that it's it's a full but it's a specific type of what's a miser
kripa you know why is this person a criminal because they had such a wealth
 glad to have such a wealth of human form and it or even want spiritual existence of such a wealth but you're not actually engaging like a a miser will have all this money and not engage it we have all this potential agent in this foolish maybe we can end on this but here's what probably as we read this let's think of your friend who came to you and confide it to you and opened up and I shared it probably even though he was given because of no one's telling me nothing anymore let it was going to share all the stuff with me now she's going to like nope he's going to bring whose name is repeated threats that her name is repeated three times
minda know but so what I'm going to read this comment other than where we from proper in the lot of people maybe most people would hear it I think no no no I don't want to hear this this kind of talk there's so much to enjoy out in life and I want to enjoy it but then you take a person that's living the dream that those people are dreaming of that they'll never actually get the smallest taste of it but that Playboy magazine this this old Indian man knows it all he knows he knows my world but he's not even doing it he just knows that sexual Indulgence is the greatest happiness in this material world and therefore they make elaborate plan to enjoy their senses especially the genitals
 this is generally found everywhere and specifically found in the western
yeah we're into it whether such regular arrangements to satisfy sex life in different ways proper came from India news like this cuz he's on the hippies and he was right in the middle of the San Francisco you know okay so specially in the in the western world they're trying to make arrangements to satisfy sex in so many different ways actually however this is not made anyone happy you are nobody happy
 even the hippies who have given up all the materialistic Comforts of their fathers and grandfathers cannot give up the sense The Sensational since I buy sensationail think he means like the sensation of it right this
facial happiness of sex life such a person to describe his crib in his misers the human form of life is a great asset
 in this life one can fulfill the call of existence or we get distracted by you know we going back to Yeats you know anything cuz he hates Yates okay do you know what you're going back to Houston you know the young ones there in each other's arms the birds up there in the trees thank you Mary
 he said
 I got caught in the central music all neglect monuments of an aging intellect
so you're going to be right there
 I got some take away. Even just at the act of sex is like it's not like it's on satisfied I just going to go to tease this out a little bit it's like even if you're like yeah we're just going to enjoy our bodies it's going to be great
 you don't want to love me it's it's it's it's what it's a sick world to prom because you're dealing with a person's psychology such a sacred thing and then we cheap and it just do a quick exchange that it's never generally just the quickest place every other Prime makes everybody feel awkward and weird and where we supposed to act from here are we friends and yeah it is it's such a deep cuz each one has their own different Center on the center is this is not on the symptoms I want to exploit you for my happiness but you're having is not working with my happiness happiness is like let's settle down and raise a family
that's what I'm reading in Anna Karina right now that's what it that's what I'm getting into right now
 until I look at those books.
 Take away this knowledge never ages
 this knowledge never ages but I do
 look at this world with one optimistic I had one pessimistic I unless we seek the truth we're destined to suffer good morning at the Forefront
 right there as a mug hold on to the lifeline through storms and good weather
 hold on monkey is there a Hold On song out there
your senses have an agenda for you
