 that's going to have will have somebody explain it cuz I do yeah but yeah
everything's on one thing right this age groups I think I think the sages could be on that just to show itself could be on that not on Zoom anymore that we'd all come there that you know it's kind of like the website that the discussion groups like The the dysport thread would be there instead like everything would be in one place and people are just some great people are just very sweetly volunteering their skill and time setting this whole thing up now cuz me and Kirsty but cannot figure it out it has been like months of service plan is that we will move off of Patron and shit everybody over and actually not only will will it be like everything's in one place and you don't like the thing that you just mentioned the calendar and all that the county would be there in everything you need is in that one place but that we begin to offer a lot more to you know like it'll open up the spaces that we can conveniently offer and when you go that you know we have over
are you laughing
 I'm not often I call them now cuz he can't call Zoomers anymore once I get off but you know it'll it'll be
 like when you go to the Patriot now it's just like this long list where we have over 500 classes already like in an archive but you can't really access them on page and know it'll be easy to see you know we got all kind of seminars and classes that we've already done and I think we're going to be inclined to offer more more regularly because it would be such a convenient place to kind of get together if you like sweet baby I gave her there's like 100 of Sweet Baby Christmas they can be it can be called the Inner Circle Inner Circle might be better that might be a little bit more appropriate
 okay Circle that's good okay so
that and yeah Italy shut up for Italy wisdom to stages.com I should be as you want to go we're going to wind up by our registration very soon so if you thinking about getting away breaking away hanging out with us and special guests Gigi is coming to do back to recovery live live so I know it's a relief Tuscany is great food it's beautiful sights it's sweet kirtan so many people are like that box Recovery Group was the highlight and people and it was always people who were like well I don't need recovery I'm not into drugs or alcohol or sex addiction or whatever they go to it they're like wow I needed this so much they go in sort of take to eavesdrop and next thing you know they're completely all in waving the flag so yeah people should check that out while they're there or it's just an added bonus if you want to go people get a lot of
lot of benefit out of the deep diving into their to their psyche into their into their shortcomings in in in in in desires to have any volunteers of their psyche the other Darkness the darkness of your psyche mistika scuba and you have ways of bringing it out
 I was sent for your benefit
 okay are you ready for today's nugget yeah today's nugget of wisdom nugget by John Eldredge you know who he is John Eldredge yes I do know he's an author is I had it somewhere I noted it down to some of these is an author
 masculine you must have written something on men or masculinity
he's also a psychotherapist as well at heart Wild at Heart men want to fight an adventure to live how they want a battle to fight men men men men men in general the masculine men want a battle to fight an adventure to live and a denture Adventure an adventure to live and a beauty to rescue okay that is what is written in their hearts that is what little boys play at that is what men's movies are about you just see it it's undeniable
 interesting OK Google 3 a masculine and feminine qualities will the first let me just say the reason why were you were
talking about this nugget today it has to do with how we understand what we're reading about what I'm right which is you know it's called Lila right play
 and neutering a Dave Lowe distributive he's a Larvitar so what's he doing he's rescuing and he's fighting a battle is involved in a in a very dramatic Adventure
 he's rescuing his beloved in the form of little blood and there's you could look at that two ways you know you could look at it and say all these people wrote their mythology corresponding with The Human Experience
 but the way that they say just tell us to understand this is that no this is the original play this is the original Adventure right
bino being displayed by the original person
 and are playing around in this world is a reflection of that we're we're actually copying that and so I think there's something in what would you do okay with John Eldredge is written I think you know you know are polarized Society
 that some people will kind of a Jack to the way that he's riding like oh man or this way means women or another way there different way
 and I think it just requires a little maturity and puts her approach to his you know because you're in a polarized Society once I was going to say yes this is exactly right this is the way it is everyone should snap into their gender roles one hundred percent if anyone Rogers out of them they're they're you know they're off their off their broken their their warped yeah that you practically evil that's One Polarized Ultra polarized
other Ultra polarized way to see is that any difference between men and women is it a social constructs you know it has there's no truth in it it's all been imposed you know but you know even that's like science and I do you know there's a fact that we have different hormones running through our bodies that affect are psychology's and different ways you know when you are boy this is in Chinese medicine and I admit there's there's a masculine energy in a feminine energy and we might click into one of the other also depending on how we were raised where are social environment that too but at the same time there is it's also woven into the DNA of you know what we are there some people when I talk about UFC or boxing or things like that that are that are just like they're very attracted to it and they're certain even matter like no I hate these bloodsports I don't want to see this
 we're talking about sort of like that sort of like the Cha-Cha
archetype the warrior archetype which is also not for every every every masculine archetype as well too but the ones you describe sounds sort of like that we sort of relish the Warfare going on in the Mahabharat we relish you know saving Pro odd tragedy when you were a boy did you play like this I mean I played War cops and robbers by I fought a lot to eat exactly and I meant it would have a and War we we used to or we used to like go down into my friend's basement put on as many like winter gloves as we could fit over hands and box with each other and each about her like crazy or are we play a game like that
more PC name for this game was kill the carrier will you throw a football in the air you know it doesn't matter how many guys you have you could have like three guys or it could be like 20 guys you throw the football in the air someone catches it and then all the 20 try to tackle the one and you just like try to survive you know but it's like that you know we wanted to fight we wanted adventure and it is within the psyche to to to rescue you know a beloved one you know like that's kind of it is what all the stories are about what when we read Krishna Leela
 did the word Lila is a really important one to understand because again if if we look at it's like all this crazed mythology why is all this killing going on it's some you have to try to try to understand there's an esoteric very deep esoteric understanding that that really brilliant
philosophers and and spiritualists have they delve deeper and deeper and deeper into the sea they use terms that were borrowed from Harley barred from the end of these words are in the ancient texts but they use constructs they borrow constructs from ancient Sanskrit drama to help us understand what's going on in these texts you know there's Lila which means literally means play right and then play Vin in all senses of the word like like a play like a drama Cristiano soccer called in an actor on the stage you know he's like but it also means like to play like child's play or play like a like the ease
 in doing anything right nice way to put it to so-so krishna's pastimes are called Leah
it's his play it's it's how you know he's this all-knowing omniscient all-powerful being
 but in his heart he desires Adventures of love that says like one you know one decide that's what that's enough to say for Phil's him as the right word but dumb it's it's his desire is it and so he plays and he allows himself to be calm
 fully absorbed in that play fully absorbed in that adventure and fully absorbed in what's called Russa or The Taste that's experienced through different loving relationships so the setting here in this Lila there's there's his beloved devotee that youngboy provide he's innocent he's pure he's he's
 deeply spiritually realize even though he's just a boy and he's being subject to the terror of
his father to renew cashew Pooh who's this not only a powerful demonic Force but like the most powerful Universal Universal sites besides Vishnu he is like the most powerful opponent and it's described that God wanting to taste that Russell wanting to taste that Adventure wanted to taste ultimately that love that's the point behind it all ultimately wanting to taste that love he loses himself
 in that Adventure in place and here we're seeing him play the role of rescue people battling around Itachi poo rescuing his beloved devotee and tasting the rest of the love exchange between him and provide are you there I saw that you were there but you know it's still interesting is 2024 and when it starts to pour rain the internet goes out
that about but I don't know I missed maybe some of your points I wanted to make this point like I got a new Backhoe or what
 is freezing up
 alright then we will recognize his until he comes back and we may have trouble with him today we can we can say you know I was mentioning that you were frozen he throws out right before you said you got a new bat, or something like that backhoe backhoe you know what the tractor to dig holes and when I try to get my daughter to play with it and she wasn't so interested but as soon as Rocco came home he just started digging holes with the back though he got so attracted to it and just that was his whole focus and meditation that being said these archetypes of boys and girls
 these are also material things as well it's not us that we are
will being we're all feminine actually we're all feminine and one supreme masculine and that gets us right back to the transit
 Dragoness freezing up again going to be an interesting one here but I think I know where he was going he was sent you know there's the sages say that in a sense and again this is you know it it's sensitive territory 222 you froze out right now I'm sorry you want to try again I don't even know what you caught what you didn't catch we didn't catch her there anything you're saying what you said that Rocco was into the thing and said she was like I said that being said
 were none of these things we are actually all spiritual being so those are just our physical bodies were not boys or girls were all feminine actually we're all feminine there's one Divine Mass so what do you mean by that we're all feminine meaning meaning there is one supreme Center in that represents
in the masculine form and in the in in the original masculine and then every Geva every living soul is is feminine and the mat and we take on a quote a gender role according to this body for a short period of time which is a reflection of the real masculine and we actually there's in their constant we're going back and forth as we take on New Birth to Edwards could really nail Wonder would wake me up in an hour with these birth it's totally fluid ounce fluid people get caught up in I'm feeling feminine peeling mask it's just like a big whatever just let you get on with life there is a real thing that we are underneath the costume that's the spirit soul and if we're in the mood of service just whatever you
 gender you pick to be in this world just pick it and move on with life because you can get caught up in your head of what I
feel like in etcetera and we are actually Spirits all we're above that anyway
 people get people get hijacked and they got off on the exit and let's just go to at what we are what we are ultimately cuz that's what Zach when we start to feed that identity I'm a spirit Soul I'm part of something bigger I'm born to give love I'm born to serve that is going to be the identity that actually satisfies the self
 there you go
 and in it so when we get into these esoteric kind of side of buck t.i. let most we spend most of our time speaking about the exoteric kind of stuff you know it's like the more conventional side of a down till you know how to keep it even mind and you know and so on but there's this esoteric side of the body which is talking which is all about this Russell which is all about the the particular loving moods
the varieties of loving moods and how they exchanged you do with God and so again these the sage is like Rupa goswami he would draw from this incredibly brilliant sophisticated tradition of Sanskrit drama
 and he would borrow their terminology and so on in their there they're constructs how they categorized
 how do they categorize these different dresses like they say they're 12 varieties of Russ's right so 12 different taste your flavors in relationship there is anger Wonder conjugal love comedy chivalry Mercy servitor ship friendship horror shock neutrality and Parenthood
 write these are all different ways of relating different experiences in relationship and what dramatist
do is they play with these and they try to increase the experience of these are like like there's like or Francis right this that says Brasa and people relish it in a certain way right or can you hear me can you think of a Krishna conscious or
 well I mean you'll find it there in in Christian book like right like they said there's a milia that's horrible that there's horia like Christmas Christmas in the in the river and he's being attacked by this serpents huge Serpent and it's got him a horrible he's all caught up in the coils of this multi-headed Serpent and everybody that loves him all the different varieties of people with different Price Rite of Love are all standing on the bank of the river and when he's caught up in the scores are experiencing horror but it's often that we read the stories like they're just like very novel story but imagine being devoted to Krishna
a lover of Krishna parent of Krishna and all the sudden Christmas swims out of the Moon River
 fight like a sea monster so to speak are fine horrific buying us love went when you're terrified about the object of your medication and your it it's a horrible experience Christian is going to get killed and it brings out an emotion and it's it's interesting because we're attracted to in the material world but what is har what is what's a horror movie in the material world it ends up making you riddled with anxiety rated R movies yes but you know there's an element of horror that may be in movies that are horror movies that may not have that effect but you're right and I agree that job that's going to get forever just like a horrible movie Jaws ruined a lot
my swimming experiences as a child now haunted houses murderous movies that stayed with me over time but when you put hard but it's it's a reflection of Something Real from the spiritual realm when Christmas in a horrible situation it evokes love is that you know that's how a following in the wake of krishnalila this is how the boxes would explain it right following in the wake of Krishna Leela the the dramatist of this world can pose drama using these elements in a similar way right cuz like you can bring in an element of Horror
 into a drama or into a film script in order for it to create a tension that gets released and when it's released the love that's being expressed is intensified right now so that's what happens when Christian is in the he's trapped up in the coils of the snake and
you know the boy is his friends who have a fraternal love for him for jurnalrisa there they're the parents are there they have the parental parental type of love and all the girlfriends are there they all have a romantic love for him there all experiencing more and then when he slips out of the the grass for that that Serpent and he climbs up on a heads and he begins to dance
 it's so genius this philosophy how everything here is a reflection are love affairs are reflection of our love with God you know yum in this this Harvey thing everyone's posting their horror movies on the even something like hard like why does it exist it's a reflection of a deep love of God
my mother my cat like mother said never ever see The Exorcist each recently put this on the on the board and in and I never did and cook Hill and I was 28 until I moved out of the ashram years old I've been a devoted for years and a big mistake if you've never seen The Exorcist never see if there's no good that can come from it find the heart in Krishna book and let that evoke Love in Your Heart through Hara Krishna being attacked by a serpent in the point it was dead when he slipped out of those coils and when he got up on the top of the heads of that Serpent and then he began this dance at the dance was simultaneously beating down the servant with every step that was also like a most beautiful artistic dance and everybody that's on the side
 the feeling of love in their specific Russia becomes heightened right like the boys their love for Christians like
 he's on
Starboy right like that that friendship love you and that becomes hiding no one else can do a Christian too and just look at him you know he's the best the girls are like just like with a romantic feelings there they're intensified like there's nothing this boy can do he's has captivated me in every way you know so that's how when we say the Christmas tree lights like a place like a drama is all orchestrated even Chris to himself forgets who he is forgets his role as maintainer of the universe's you know jagannatha and all of that you know the lord of the universe or as part of my mama is the soul of the universe know he'd become he's Krishna and these are his friends and these are his lovers and these are his parents and he becomes just as children we see children become completely absorbed in their play
 so Krishna even more so becomes completely absorbed
in the Raza and the Hora or the is all designed to heighten the experience of Ross of the experience of love which is the very point to our existence and you know when when you read books about like how to write a script yeah they are they all are going to tell you more or less the same thing that you have your protagonist right and you just have to give him a problem give him a struggle give him a you know some some obstacle that he has to overcome and then you're in we had, they purchased a house now there's a problem they're going to show that your house is it okay to wear murdered in a house how it is that you have to increase the recent increase it increases increase the house is speaking to me and telling me to get out that's essentially the descriptive practically every film is like there's a problem for the protagonist and then they then the writer has to make it worse and worse and worse and worse and then when they get out of it there's a wrestler
experience in in height and ressa that comes through that it's a one we read about in a string of old man lie and miss the whole thing is childish it's not child you might say I don't have faith that it's actually happened but an objective person that actually examines it the see that this is not that that you can't say it's like silly or childish it's very sophisticated was being presented here there's a great. That's been analyzed by brilliant thinkers in great depth so we'll try to do a little bit with it as long as you're around my brain is completely hijacked on traumatizing movies bring it back to bring it back
 the problem I don't like that Amityville Horror is these are real things this isn't just a movie these are real life occurrences of haunted places and that's scary and it could happen to you you could move into some haunted
give me people Legends in New York City Coast Ava and apartments and then they clean it up and then you're moving in and you think you got a good deal
 do little keertana you move on Rogan us Good Luck Good Luck speaking of moving on
 I have no lunch at the Manchester and I was in his hometown Jesus
 your animosity on that I'm sure even wrote them they themselves would be awesome to do before starting the Shema by the time which is every mean to Conquest when should I be respectful of base and cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on Tina and Richie the super most human being to want to start earning be off today of the author not stop write a show about race Unity must locate back to you about the Kenai sticky
 the regular tennis in classes in the Bible time and my brand new service to the pier devotees
become erratic hated and loving service the Supreme Lord whose praise with transcendental songs and establishes will be established as an irrevocable fact oh My Gana to put on this young man Genesis La Cucaracha how's my sweet would have made him a I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are open in my eyes or the torch light of knowledge I offer my basin sees a Lotus feet
 why don't the Amityville Horror things happen like in Croatia in Dubrovnik in Dubrovnik and split what why is it always in America that we get all the haunted houses we get all these
 nightmarish things
 huh I really don't know okay there after what text are you wearing reading from Canto 7 chapter 8 x 25 x 25 x 25
they're after the grade we're e24 I'm not sure if I did
 I think we have 324
 just as a small insect false forcibly into a fire like that happens and the insignificant creature becomes invisible when hiranyakashipu attacked the Lord who's full of its bulge Irani kashyap who became invisible yeah we're at this yesterday this is not at all astonishing but the Lord is always situated in pure goodness formerly during creation he entered the Dark Universe an illuminated it by his spiritual effulgence just to catch up you know we have a moment of will certainly anger is being expressed right this is the string Dave burst out of this Lord Vishnu in this
 ferocious form burst out of the pillar
 and is manifesting a
turn on the highest Cosmic level I got the perfect form for it he's manifested the perfect form this half man half lion form and you know there's been some horror you know it's this is following a moment of horror we're hugely powerful demoniac figure was threatening to slice off the head of his son
 and so now he's busted out and he's manifesting this this anger is Transcendental emotion this deeply if you know but it's the anger of love and now he's going to battle
 okay this is 25 they were after the great demon hiranyakashipu who is extremely angry swiftly attack the string a day with his club and began to beat him Lord as stringent as however captured the great demon along with his Club just as Gruta my capture is fake this is what happens we get our ego attacked a demon you really
your heels and your ego is yourself I found that it's become much better as a devotee that when when people go after me I start to reflect on why they're going after me and sometimes I like I got a point there sometimes I'm at Aragon sometimes I'm self-centered sometimes I'm narcissistic you know material Consciousness were always trying to defend their ego the show me stories about great Souls we're just saying maybe or they just said you know what you can talk whatever you want I'm okay with it here at the great Souls never let it bother them they would like aloof to public opinion they can be praised or they could be spit upon their completely okay with it
 either yes I'm here but I'm just wondering why you saying that was that kind of said that because her and she poo is losing his mines here
because he's being challenged by prologue he's being challenged by everybody at this point a lot and assuring the Dave and therefore he and that's why anger Rises how how dare you okay
 oh you to steer a great son of Bard when Lord of string it gave hiranyakashipu a chance to slip from his hand just as Garuda sometimes place with a snake and let it slip from his mouth the demigods who lost their abodes and who are hiding behind the clouds for fear of the demon did not consider that incident very good indeed they were perturbed the play goes on yeah they would have the full rustic wouldn't been able to experience fully if he too quickly
 killed her any cuz you poop so he's letting them go and it's going to take me to the play and he's giving us a chance to experience to watch this Wonder in Krishna says he doesn't just appear to kill demons he appears to be a pleasure to the devotees and often.
people ask this question if he's got what you need just like wipe them all out because the devotees actually relish and part of the relishing is oh my God oh my God this is going to happen to build up that Haydn's attachment to the Lord and that's what's going on right now the demigods are freaking out this is this doesn't look good don't worry it's going to work out this way we know how this ends Chris Godwin that's a great point it's almost like like an adult walking up the children and just say well why you still playing cops and robbers aren't you just put the robber in the jail and you can be done with this know we're playing over enjoying the play
 with her and they catch who was freed from the hands on a string a Dave
 he falsely thought that the Lord was afraid of his prowess there for after taking a little rest from the fight he took up his sword and shield and again attacked the Lord with great force
 making the loud shrill level
shrill sound of laughter the Supreme personality of godhead and Ryan who's extremely strong and powerful capturing hiranyakashipu who's protecting himself with a sword and shield leaving no gaps open
 with the speed of a hawk sea hawk steel attack something deadly sin Hawks I don't know if I've ever seen except I was riding my bike down the road I saw a hawk just come out of nowhere just pick up squirrel and fly with a squirrel super quick
 so like a hawk Lord Narayan is extremely strong and powerful captured run you catch tapu who's protecting himself with a sword and shield leaving no gaps with the speed of a hawk or I can catch tapu move sometimes in the sky and sometimes on the earth is eyes closed because of fear of the Stringer Dave's laughter
 I was teaching yoga on the grass once
had some clients house and he had chickens just roaming around haha come down and lift a hen in the sky and I had to go
 and the hawk drop the chicken feet up
 it looked it looked like I had to work out some issues with fear
 abandonment by the rooster as a snake captures a mouse or Garuda captures a very venomous snake or distribute have captured her any cash you poo poo cannot be pierced even by the Thunderbolt of King injure it right there's no way to beat this guy at this point even that Dave has were afraid of him because you poop moved his limbs here there and all around very much Afflicted of being captured or destroyed and replaced the demon on his lap right it's not the Earth and it's not the sky with another one of the options or false
you can be killed on Earth you can be killed in the sky OK me put them on his lap it's not the Earth or sky so clever supporting him with his thighs and the doorway and he has five because he's half man he's Nara Paris he's man and he's he's the Lord that's the half man half lion
 and and the doorway of the Assembly Hall so he's in the doorway of the Assembly Hall he's not inside he's not outside through another local another loophole do I don't want to be able to pay the indoors or outdoors in the Lord very easily toward the demon to pieces with a nails of his hands gory scene gory scene you ever seen a cat ripped the head off of mouse work is going to see if these things are
 what is Gory but it but it's also makes you cheer so he gets pulled a few people this is not this is horrible I was celebrating the death of
anybody guess what everybody gets liberated you get killed by Lord Vishnu you're liberated it's specifically
 and they say that because you remember if we go back to the third Canto who is who is running a shih-poo either dryer Vijay yeah he's one of these Gatekeepers by contador because they didn't allow the four Kumar's into the spiritual realm into vaikunta they were cursed to take birth three and three times as demons in multi-purpose is are being played here right in one sense okay they're paying the price for their mistreatment of the of the sages 24 Kumar's but it's also Krishna Krishna says that when we were at that that nugget it said like this is what he actually said he's talking about this the spirit to battle
if this an adventure and he says that this is he says you see it
 it's what he said it what it is written in their hearts right it's written in their hearts like it's inside us and the way the sage is explained
 this all this Leland our existence is there saying that our cells being my nude fragments of Christmas energy as he has this in him the desire to battle
 we also have that desire in us to battle you know if it plays out in in our lives and so Krishna he has that desire but he's not going to battle anyone he actually only has his kind of intimate connection with his own devotees so giant peach are his devotees, they take they play the role in the drama of being these fearsome demon Cricket becomes completely lost in that drama forgets that I'm all-powerful
fights with them and so that is being that's playing out here that that purpose is being played out here but also as we're reading this something you know like he's fully he's fully loaded train is is is it's Vishnu taken this form as you were saying
 to bring pleasure to provide in a lot of similar like this is so wonderful my Lord is Manifest it just to save me you know he's feeling that that that rests at the same time machine of his carefully protecting the word of his devoted Lord For Mama who gave all those benedictions okay I grant you the benediction you can't be killed indoor-outdoor I grant you the benediction that you can't be killed by man or beast I grant you the benediction that you can't be killed the day or night at you know he indoors or Outdoors he eat it even though it was like such
dramatic scene he still carefully protected the word of her mama by killing him as man-beast killing him not indoors or Outdoors killing him on his lap and said the sky or the Earth to know he did it also he's doing anything so I want everything happened so many things are happening at once and it's even a Charming little stories like a most Charming child story with very very incredible depth to it as well and you know in one sense the big thing that's happening is this is the moment that all the Davis have been hoping for and praying for that they've been oppressed and harassed and in the in the the social order of the universe has been disrupted by this horrible undefeatable demon
 Anna and and they know the only solution this is Vishnu can take care of it cuz we can't take care of it and but there
their devotion is not like palaze devotion it's not as powerful as not as selfish as not as pure as not as strong
 so it wasn't so Vishnu appeared in in in this most
 buta right this most wonderful form for prolog specifically but at the same time he carried out the purpose of satisfying the David as well
 will do another one at 7:35 and it takes 30
 like when you guys are like knots get going straight to his mouth and Main were sprinkled with drops of blood
 and is fierce eyes full of anger or impossible
 to look at licking the edge of his mouth with this tongue the Supreme personality
decorated with a Garland of intestines taken from her any cash up ooze abdomen resembled a lion that is just killed an elephant talk about or right that's horrible I'm still seeing that you can just Google that YouTube search that the screen person I've got had wide many many arms first uprooted Renny koshy Pooh's heart
 okay I'm getting gourrier ripped him through him aside and turned towards the demon soldiers
 these soldiers had come in thousands to fight with him it with raised weapons and we're very faithful followers of her any cash you poop a buttload is stringing Dave killed them all with with merely the ends of his nails so so picture this like your ad Ava and you're watching this you've been terrified by this horrible
 tyrant
demoniac tyrant
 used he's seen impenetrable impossible to kill he's gotten all these benedictions from Vermont nobody can get them for a long time he's been throwing their like and you've been suffering he's here after year to the point where your leaders are now enslaved by him you may feel doubtful that you're ever going to be free of his depression and you think what you're all about why am I here in the first place is there no God is there no God in control and then and then it seems like he's been killed but so just to erase any doubt you know you know it when he reaches and pulls out that hard and just throw it out it's like it's such a dramatic seeing you know no one but Christian. You know kid can
 can create such a dramatic such as you know you see that hot guy you like he's done
all the tragedies were facing in this world is aware of in this world do you think what's your opinion do you think like we're we're getting our weed like hoping for some like Lourdes Trinidad to appear and just like this is Wipe Out the crazy mentality of this world if you think this is all a drama that were living in right now in order to for the Lord to appear in a sense it is a drama in one sense it is you know
 you know that there are many metaphors that that could be used to know it when one sense it's a prison in one since it's a playground and one since it's a drama you know I was like all of these are valid
 ways of seeing this world according to the sacred texts but in one sense it's on real right in one sense is a virtual reality but the devotees understand that it's here for
are Reformation at the we are out of touch with Who We Are
 we're trying to play as if we were that central figure
 u.s. Krishna you know what's being manifested is krishna's the all-powerful the old beautiful Duvall attractive in one way he is that is in this
 is there a special form of not a Syma of man lion we are promised rather than accepting the role of pearl odd
 we want the role of machine today right we want to be the central figure in the drama
 we don't realize we don't have the confidence of the faith it
 actually it's as exciting and enjoyable and wonderful and satisfying and is deep it and it in every way to be the devotee rather than the center of devotion hold love in your heart you know it in that way and be loved in that way
and so we trying to take that role here and the world is according to her, it seemed like okay Chris is saying if you want that you can have that I'll give it to you and he gives us the world in which we play
 but he also puts he also integrates elements into that world so that will be reformed and kind of recognize our troop be able to re reawaken the reality of our perfect situation in the spiritual realm and so we play it and then this love, is there that you know when we act out of harmony with our true nature we feel some pain experienced some of our own horror you know and as you were speaking I was thinking yeah there are some tragedies in the world and there's some horrible things in this world there's some hate in this world
 but we're also here to work on her own personal tragedies hate and Harlow going on with their own consciousness
they're all they're here to help us reform you know if we I was I was thinking this the other day
 cuz there are you know it in RNR
 they are our world and our media is bringing to our attention so many tragic situations so how many practically helpless painful horrific right there he deeply sad things that we experienced in this world but I also thought if it's in the feeling that you get
 when you think about them or experienced them is just how dark this world can be really dark but if it wasn't for that
 we would hopelessly keep trying to enjoy it rather than transcend it you know and I'm not sin by saying that I'm not saying that we should just Escape
not address the issues in this world I'm not saying that I'm top but I'm talking about something else and we just need to have the maturity to separate these if if it wasn't for that we would likely never develop
 the determination or the ability to let go of this world and seeks something higher a lot of are a lot of organization in a lot of our growth comes from pain from our tragedy from our loss from our betrayal from a heartbreak that's where we grow we don't generally don't grow and everything is running smooth and now you keep trying enjoy it you keep trying to adjust it keep trying to relish and yeah young Miss Mara any takeaways today
 we're Spirits Souls above our gender designation Strawberry Shortcake
how about some pineapple upside down cake
 Christmas Christmas horror won't traumatize and evokes love ya don't watch The Exorcist and a takeaway
 stop defending yourself and reflect why Others May attack you
 firefighters attacking me watch the play unfold and relish the Lila
 great Souls never take things personally
 mystery of respects the words Vermont and finds the loopholes
 it's more fulfilling to be the devotee of God instead of God very interesting very interesting huh otherwise why would God take that role himself has
reawaken our true nature and harmonize what are you awake
 can a man straight edge banding reawaken XX the darkness urges us to transform and transcend horror for Love's sake not worse take a horoscope fists are ever do a little kirtan and move on move on move out of that house I don't even go there I think I've only seen really one horror movie in my life
 what was your horror movie
 Cape Fear
what were the guys underneath the truck is the villain keeps coming back keeps coming back like you think he's gone and he's in his back they play with that element a lot right and a lot of times it just gives sick people
 creepy ideas in the regular world
 locking people in Wells in your house or basements or dungeons I've never think of that don't go so.
 Yeah it is but still but still must be like indulging it right movies about it
 relish it
 relish this year
when it says that's why Rocketship taxes all around his house is broke and I think you need weapons in the house
 that's why I wanted to die
 that was why I was speaking at the house again you just know he wasn't coming back you know that's a good sign
 what the hell is hot. That's usually that usually ends it
