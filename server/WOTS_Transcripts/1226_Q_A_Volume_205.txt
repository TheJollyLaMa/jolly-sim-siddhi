 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the sages a daily yoga podcast with your hoe stroganoff and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York a stupid ass welcome to show everybody Welcome today's sleeping Saturday
 it's Q&A that is the day we received questions from our audience from are others from our Zoomers a right into Miss Mara Miss American Pie less than we go through them and then we try our best to give an answer and it's the day that me and Mary are getting ready and Catherine a and Bobby marchan and we're getting ready to head out of here
add Brandy
 all right so no show tomorrow or the next last time I saw you guys in person
 is October 15th in the Delhi airport yeah we are on our way to Indy again
 we get a lot of time I'm so happy we designed Our Lives to be an India lot cuz you and I get a lot of nourishment from there who you know and I was just telling you before they before they show you know some couple weeks back and mentioned the idea of us having some kind of our own little Asher I'm here I'm in my poor and I mention on the show and some people from here her head like yeah but we got to make this happen that's helped you guys get into this unit you know what I think we just got a dream dream dream without personal motive dream look like what could be the best service to render in Crystal just act like it you know what I mean I believe in the power of intention and you can make your own
you know your Universe wants you to be abundance materializing Krishna how would you like me to serve this is how I think it would be good this is ultimately your Your Divine influence and I think if we really dream big and where that's going to benefit the listeners the best and we know there is a lot of benefit I got a beautiful message from JJ Sullivan listen to Delaware and he says all these people are from Liz massei just another for wisdom of the Sages
 and I was thinking we didn't have that we didn't have a way to check in on
daily basis unless you got out of your apartment what I'm a Subway and went to the ashram know what I mean and sometimes the Situation's I can't do it today but you know the beauty of the information age is you can let Transit Dental information out to be the ugly there's the information you can suck away your life scrolling through animal attack videos and get caught up in some late-night rabbit holes on YouTube the beauty of it too and that way you can hear it the bottom of time and you know we had teachers in our life that like literally like it maybe figuratively and literally held our hands in our infant stages of bacta and trying to develop an attachment for spirit and a Detachment from things that will bring us down and the podcast conserve like that for so many people because I'm seeing every day just assume alone but then your meeting people also in my poor like they listen everyday and it it becomes some type of banister to hold
climbing up steep steps of the material realm like that you know it's great because I just went through my head I sent you I went through my mind different people in my poor that I know their kind of well-established here but that listen to us and and really understand what we're doing
 so if we would like to do something here you know those then perhaps those people can kind of help us take the steps that we need to take here if we wanted to make some more than happy to have some support and then they started coming for today that was a nice thing I it was a birthday party of one of these wonderful devotees and he hosted everyone in this house is a beautiful thing and when are when are wrong when we take the our our little pilgrimage here and yeah February so we'll go to their home it's a beautiful home and you know the talion devotee with a one of those wood
 events to do wood burning
and just pumping out quality really nice Quality Pizza & Beyond that I really loved was just it was a beautiful family and I was like those those devotees at that invite us over and then their children and their grandchildren love it a little six months little grandchild little boy sweet and it was just a very beautiful loving family with Christian in the middle of it and save it in the middle of it and so I wanted to bring everyone I was I said you know it's a little Ford for me to ask but would you mind if we bought 50 FIFA 12 how do you have children and grandchildren and I think it's great but you know because we know a lot of people in India it gives us opportunity on these pilgrimages to be a little bit more intimate with you know regular people were like
dedicated to the cause spiritual Evolution so I think that's going to be a highlight excited for a little my poor trip let's let's see where this goes we try to Envision something some of that be nice service we put it out into the out into the atmosphere and see what happens and you know yeah
 you know what skin is it's amazing how they get ready to talk to Henry says multi-generational devotee families build Faith yeah we had a little get-together and some local devote more pack and Jamie step came by the other day Christmas and Jamie steps it's only very sweet
together with the devotees and we're seeing something bigger than just our family we're seeing a bigger family mersing of a bigger family are connected to Spirit and it puts things in perspective and it is like we're reading the Bible time of the son of chips arcade you saying are you my father had millions of fathers we do have a family in this world there's a real blood relationship but then there's a spiritual family right that that that we also are connected with in a in a big way and sometimes we can go very very deep very very quick with with a spiritual family
 maybe that we could never go to with our blood birth families at the blood birth or
 blood a blood thinner by the way speaking of Ages family yeah
I reached out to someone and then I got some information latest information about to Louis really you got so except for those that I bought two Louis you know Luis Rivera he's someone that Rogan often I know since I've known him since I was 15 years old but he was one of these happening guys on the hardcore scene back in the day
 and one of the early people that was in the Box in that hardcore scene and it from the beginning of wisdom the sages even before was wisdom sages he was checking in every morning he's commonly coming on in the morning is a Zoomer and God it's been months now
 that he was but we still don't know the whole story but sounds like he was with attacked and and and put into a coma so four months he was in a coma and just but it's
he's coming out of the coma. This is what I got Josh
 yeah I just want to make sure I don't read anything I shouldn't read
 he has a primary doctor pulmonary specialist in case manager signed him neurologist has not been assigned yet Labs were ordered this morning
 it's just talking about some details but I want to get to the important details
 I see neurological assessment score once a day however they do sporadic checks his alertness waxes and wanes this morning he stuck out his tongue on command huh
 and a few hours did a few hours did not respond anything this afternoon he did against to go out of town and came and he acknowledged his sister had her visit
he followed her and his mother around the room with his eyes
 a root sticks out of town he raises eyebrows he is fighting that's why I said he's fighting okay there no signs of infection and the doctors are making plans to remove the track check traffic to me. To me in the in the trachea feeding tube soon
 so I assume that means you can eat and you know when it happens on his own that's beautiful so he's responding it seems like something that must mean he's out of the coma again a long time listen to podcast pre podcast Super Soul Shaker song that he was there every day and and he was you know foundational one of those like inspirational people in the beginning of me and piss to bespeak the journey so he's been a special place in our heart as well I think Kelly Becker was saying that thinks Kelly said that she might visit him with one that would be available so maybe we can make that happen otherwise so when we get back we should visit him yeah

I'm up alcohol Nike enjoy the material world and they're actually getting something much greater than just being quote Sober Sober Sober and not getting drunk and go down on all my bender and what kind of trees are not on but for the most part
 o Krishna costume I said goodbye to taruni last night I saw it was
 the tricky tricky tongue Christians got some plan
 Chris has got some plan
it's getting very questions that need to be answered. Ok
 this is from Anonymous via email
 even just the other day I want to because it not amiss ones are the best ones are going to do are you kidding or not there's a reason they're not Alamos
 I am going to be up there was a mentally grateful for cheer and hope you three bring to my life every single day come on
 I have a question about authenticity
 I often hear about authenticity and how boxy practice is going to bring out the best in UPS our authentic self but as I'm going through my life I'm troubled each day by this quest for authenticity
 I feel that the practice of
has made me become more aware or if I may say become more troubled perturbed by this Quest I'm a Wi-Fi mother and sort of a facilitator or an education firm
 while juggling through these roles and others such as being a friend daughter etcetera I find myself trying to trying very hard to be my real self for example I want to show genuine love to my husband and be very authentic in a relationship as I understand that it is not just limited to physical or emotional bond however there are times when I'm doing something or being with him and other friends just to please him or to please them
 considering that is my duty to serve my husband that that that way and eventually this will lead us both to Krishna I tend to hide my own self
 well if you asked what does it feel like
not at all
 I suffer from not being authentic to my own self or to my husband in such situations hands my question is am I faking when I'm trying to serve am I not faking when I'm trying to serve my husband or locked him that way or can I be authentic to myself and yet be genuine to others I must mention here that my husband is a nice man and has been increasingly appreciative of the boxy practice oh okay I get it he's not into boppy but he's
 nice about it he's nice about it this encourages me to be my best self to him and serve him yet I often lose my sanity when battling between authentic to my own self into the relationship and the battle continues in other Circles of Life 2
 I hope I made my question clear please let me know your thoughts
very very interesting question
 want to try to frame this out in in regular English what this person is going through he sure you know it I mean she's saying she's she wants a spiritual life back to life and she wants it to be authentic so
 it seems like the path of bhakti Demands
 a certain kind of honest straightforward lifestyle and it seems like her lifestyle demands that she sometimes acts like things are important that according to the philosophy body aren't so important and when she's showing those those other things importance she's wondering she's being an authentic to that path that she's chosen
 if I understand it correctly and and you know where I am
 I really like this question
that tension that are non Amis write her in her is writing about
 that quite that tension goes straight it's not just like
 boxy practitioners that are beginners go through that and then it's gone Russ the Sara Lee and it might be for some people their entire life
 is the circums to the external circumstances completely aligned with the internal objective
 but the tension that you're feeling it rises up to the highest level of devotee to the highest level and the example that I give is rupen Sonata goswami
 I like this I like where you're going to be okay because you're special so I was going to share that again thank you said that yesterday that was my realization in the bathroom it is to say that part of it is it how'd that come in the bathroom
stupid is special and I told you after I go with it okay if you know where call droop on new place which means like in our lineage we consider ourselves the fathers of Ruth's Chris, it's certainly sit on and go swimming both and there's a historical in a record of in their early life they were they were born into what that you know would be called like a Hindu family
 I'll bet they were preventable families and they were just like these rarely qualified people like
 they just had it you know some people are just able to lead in it and so on and they spoke multiple languages their families were incredibly wealthy they were like me like like real gentleman what is brilliant as economically and such so from for me to say exactly what their jobs are hard but more less they were running the economy of
something like that you know under the Muslim government directly under the most like another under the leader of the Muslim government they were at the highest ages thereof of the unit government responsibilities
 and butt sweat so they're externally serving this Muslim tyrants and having to David had Muslim names
 you know I end and they had to kowtow I suppose is that the right word
 Kyle Toto I think of a cow that they had to they had to play along externally and then they know if they didn't that the government was kind of like hey you know take up this responsibility run this government for its or
 we can really make life very uncomfortable for all of your people
this was at time of a severe depression as I like the Invaders would hand selected few people that okay these guys are very qualified they're going to be working for us now so yeah okay but they have very big positions within that government and at the same time
 they were
 deep devotees of did the deepest I mean for us Robinson on goswami their gopis in Christmas Lila in the spiritual world and they're in their manifest in this Incarnation as these bengalis devotees
 they they were in that position working that government of feeling the inauthenticity I suppose you could say you know like the attention that something like the tension that you're feeling so I have to go to realize if I could just leave one life
 and they were writing letters to shoot a Tonya you know
expressing you know I'm beautiful devotion language how they wanted to meet him and serve him and inside and treat your ten-year-old back to them I know I have the mail come today if you can pick up there so when they did meet up they met in the town called rumack alien been gone
 and Street attorney said this to them and if they are this is a beginning from verse 209
 of this I think it's the second chapter of the module you have one yet chapter 1
 text 209 but text to 11 is really the one the verse that I want to read about it he said you have written several letters showing your humility
 I can understand your behavior from those like
I can tell Who You Are by reading your letter he's saying no
 by your letters I could understand your heart therefore in order to teach you I sent you one verse which reads as follows now dear Anonymous questioner here's his first think about it and meditate. He said this is yours the first if a woman
 is attached to a man other than her husband okay so the racy here right to a man other than her husband she will appear very busy
 in carrying out her household affairs
 externally she's not letting anybody know that her mind is anywhere else in the should not be coming because she's internally absorbed in this other object of love
 it doesn't mean she's becoming slack in her
home Duty she's actually more together than ever before yeah she's not letting out any hint like that's not going wrong or something else happened to her mind is focused elsewhere so if a woman is attached to a man other than her husband she will appear very busy and carrying out her household Affairs but within her heart
 she's always were relishing feelings of association with her paramour
 okay setsuna
 I believe what he was telling that's in there that's the end of the first so I believe what he was telling them to do your job in that government and do it really well meticulously meticulously but internally you're more absorbed than ever in your thoughts of Krishna
 and so are you know so let's go back to the question now
I'm not saying that I don't think your situation is exactly like that but I think there's a common element to it that there's something that you're experiencing internally that your husband doesn't really understand
 and my point is is that even when you're with him and being a good wife and even doing things that you don't that you aren't particularly interested in doing these are the things that are making you feel oh I had to go bowling with my husband and his friends
 something like that maybe but whatever I do or whatever right you did something that isn't in your heart that's not exactly what you want to do
 you'd rather be reading Baba time with your husband and his friends you would rather be in here town with your husband and his friends he then you would feel authentic but what time you're saying is it's not in authentic it is not even so much as externally what's going on what's important what's going on inside
what you do is you do those You See
 we each have these two different kind of selves
 the functional self
 in the fundamental self right so your fundamental self is you you're realizing I'm a devote an eternally
 I'm a servant a loving servant of beautiful sweet baby Krishna that's who I am that's my authentic self but it's not inauthentic to play another role on the functional level I'm also a wife to a husband that I have a job I have all these different roles that I play extremely and I'm playing them in realms
 where my fundamental
 identity is not understood it doesn't make a parent also for boo it's like they're going to like soccer games or like PTA meetings or after-school meeting the things that have nothing to do with the basics of hearing a champion
play name and kirtan and it's like you feel like how did I get caught in the in this mud trap but it's there's a very famous were written by Rupa goswami
 right that defines what is what he calls Altima bhakti pure the highest body
 and there's says it what is it what is it a nut on a novel ashutosh onion Jana Karma generator it means that the motive behind ya know which means I want to enjoy the things of this world or the motive behind us are behind Carmen which means I want to do other things in this world of the mold behind ya know which means I want to escape the sufferings of this world it means you're back to your devotion
 is not covered by those desires
 okay but it is commentary on that Ruble goswami explains that even SRI chaitanya
himself the emblem of the deepest body
 he would sometimes do things socially to keep social peace like princess when his father died he went to Gaya to perform the rituals that his son would normally perform for the father and is it from his from a pure body perspective those rituals aren't even necessary
 but he did them to keep the social piece right to keep everything running smoothly externally and you may have to do that in so many ways and by keeping things running smoothly externally
 it means that you can focus on your body when the when the time is available and if things were on smooth socially it would be harder to do that you know it if if you are callous to your husband in an uncaring about his circumstances and his you know quote on quote needs
 you might feel like I'm or tentically Pratt
somebody but your whole body world will become disturbed because your marriage would become Disturbed
 but what are you doing is your if you're doing what you need to do to keep things stable in life and that serving a bucking and that sent it entirely authentic it's not it you're doing what's best
 for your body and it again in internal you can always be in a place
 in a very deep place they came out in a very deep Place internally even when the external situation is a matter fact it can even increase the intensity that internal experience
 so so yeah I don't think what you doing is it authentic I love your answer I love to hear more from you earlier I'm not going to go into any more cuz I think you really nailed I think you really nailed it the only thing I can say is sometimes in the mitts of you know going through the motions of material existence you become completely hijack by material existence
so therefore your meditation isn't secretly on Krishna life like a Lover's like us like a secret lover you actually become completely hijacked and your life and your senses and your mind and your intelligence been taken over by that Maya and then by Christians Mercy you get reclaimed hopefully so trudge through the mud
 but don't forget the goal around 8 or whole life has been really wasted question here every day every day even if some people just get a job anymore to do their situation here everyday
 everyday everyday everyday remember to like share comment
 everyday everyday everyday
 all right all right
the next question is not his kind of similar
 I would say this is from Aaron
 how do you get an advance as she asked a question last week thanks for your answer to my last question that she's on a roll she's going to go for the record how many questions can get answered
 we got some people way ahead of you
 okay thanks for your answer the last question I have to had something else come up that I'm hoping for some clarification on
 I work at a very specialized retail business and the more I embrace the teachings of bhakti the more almost angry I am with the consumer mindset
 make sense
 I consume most of our customers are very understanding and pleasant however I had one this week
so angry over a pair a cowboy boots under stand that some people take cowboy boots very serious that is like to those who are into cowboy boots that is sort of like the hat in the boot that's everything the bell pepper
 what are the belt buckle belt buckles sure that goes with it too
 okay
 most orchestras Jerry Anderson cowboy boots pre pre bakhtin Erin like before she got in the body it would have would have been she would have been panicked and trying everything to make the customer happy but the new Aaron
 is like it's a pair of boots lady they're lit they literally do not matter haha
so on one hand very good good at helping control my anxiety I am all for that is this kind of like the stages of grief and things grief and things that will ab and flow as I learn more I do enjoy my job just figuring out how it fits into this practice so I can be content and still so I can be so I can be content and still provide for my household
 okay so that question basically she's she's in she's in it she's in the in the midst of bet you she's dealing with the mundane previously the Monday and could she have an awesome job as you get a debauch do you realize I get it none of these things are actually going to satisfy me or or the customers and why am I working so hard to sell people things that won't act
satisfy them
 can I take a stab at this so please please there comes a time I feel like in bhakti as you get into it where you do go about these duties in life and we do them like what Coast you beside like the secret lover you have a secret lover and you're just showing up in all the same ways you think you're not affecting anybody you are tremendously you don't even realize it you're affecting everybody in your Universe by your personal transformation but there will come a time most likely I seen this where Christian will shift like he's got a Christian is going to ask you do you want to go through this door
 and you're going to say yes I do and that's going to cause you to close another door behind you and it happens with a larger even knowing that it's going to happen like it sounds like that fork is coming up in Aaron's life doesn't it
did you want sometimes it's like do you want things that will make material sense
 but no spiritual sense or do you want do you want would make sense spiritually you got to be careful cuz sometimes we get one of these like Faustian Bargains offerings like yeah I'm going to take this but I'll sacrifice my soul be careful with that because sometimes these choices we make are not just for a moment sometimes they suck ass into one year 5 years 10 years and we're in it for 10 years and just can't extricate ourselves be very very careful at Forks in the road talk to devotees that you trust what do you think I'm going through this you're going to get are you just keep going straight you're going to get offered opportunities and you're going to have to make a choice and when you choose Spirit it allows more spirit in more spiritual people in more connected people in and when you choose Maya even a shiny is Maya can be
it's going to let more material Affairs into your life and then what's going to happen is you've surrounded yourself with that and that becomes part of your life and part of your existence so I say for now just keep going through it see these get these spiritual Epiphany like you're getting right here and wait till the sports come and then go north even though South sometimes appears more exciting or more sexy or more shiny on the outside shiny material life is nothing but a shiny piece of broken glass you you run towards it you pick it up it slices up your hands
 with you that you know
 Aaron's question showing a bit of volume
 what's the word I'm looking for
 flip is flipping the right
sing like she's a little bit like her mom is a cowboy was such a problem you know that you're really taking this so seriously could really set it to the person it would be nice if our previous in the previous question that woman to deal with her husband that way that would be concerning it's less concerned at work you know in one sense you've made it you've made it you've made a deal with your employer it sounds like that that you are mented do the best you can to serve their customers well and so you do that
 but it sounds like I kind of agree with Rugrats it's something and in the message
 sounded to me like
 your life will change you know and I saw that you wrote on the board to change it so scary and then I get that but maybe maybe your life isn't for change you know,
maybe your internal life
 is is going to I think it is kind of like this when our internal life shifts Krista can shift our external life
 so that we're ready to take another step you know
 I can happen in surprising ways so I'm not saying that's going to happen like next week or something like that but it's something that the way that you express yourself kind of made me feel a little bit of that
 you can ship real fast real quick you can be 180 degree hairpin turn you know with your life and you got to be almost prepared for it
 you know I'm a see Marilyn is writing some lunch at Porta and I haven't even read the whole thing yet but the fact that you what you what you're gaining through Reading Bobbitt almond and hearing about to yoga philosophy the fact that it it gives you a certain detach
to say come on in spare cowboy goes why in the world would you get so wrapped up in this
 it's giving you that Detachment but it can also give you
 a kind of softer heart that allows you to relate with the customers in ways that and beautiful ways that you might not have been able to relate to them before also so that's something to consider to you know like there's a there's a place for detachment
 you know for the Detachment that we getting from butt to practice and there's also a place for like the soft hardness that we gain from bout to practice in them
 I think you do apply them as you feel inspired. You know Maryland rides like these you know that the Baki practice has helped me not to work in customer service not get caught up with the collars overreactions remember that I'm there to hell I solve whatever and then you also wrote something
Play Good Witch I love this he he says I struggle to remember Krishna everyday good Joppa is the best medicine carve out some time whether it's one round or 10 Rounds or dishes
 hold that mind on Divine sound and it is what it is not just any sound and it's not even the Holy Name coming out of your mouth it's your concentration on the name it's like if you feel like it in a combination lock is not just spinning it back and forth its spinning it back and forth to the precise number and the precise Direction so this is life with one chanting japa
 we are just not rattling names out of our mouths we are hearing and calling Divinity into our life and so if you can do with that type of attention and intention then that will carry through the whole day practice that
 practice and you know
the practice of thinking tell me what kind of customer service my wife if you if you were to ask her like when do you seek us to just really get angry really got Disturbed
 customer service on the phone and I have to wait 15 minutes for someone to get on the phone and then I get an incompetent person that doesn't know what they're talkin about in faking it like they do like if you want to tell me sir I don't know the answer that question but I'm going to find someone that can get a free I'm perfectly satisfied with that answer but if I if I'm hearing you and I'm cutting right through and I'm saying you don't know this person yeah this person is faking it this person is like doesn't know and they're not willing to tell me that they don't know when they're in there just making my life much more difficult and they're not what you know I guess you're cool that's the worst
you know my my wife is always over hearing when I have one of those conversations you know and like sometimes she says I can pay you did good that time better so that customer service it really is an opportunity for Bucky Yogi to practice
 their own their own tolerance write their own that they can put a lot of it can be a yogic training ground infrastructure you know dealing with customers and then getting upset and in taking all the ego out
 right and just saying sir
 I understand that you're upset let's see what we can do for you now like I think that could be like a you know I was as as amongst you know I told Bug of agita is everyday for years you know and and it really was a training ground for tolerance in Hume
loyalty and dumb and it's so that all that sucks kind of help of her body to so if if you actually approached your job in the way it changes everything even though the job may be externally entirely mundane
 it becomes entirely spiritual if you're in that Consciousness if you're if you are saying let me practice being a real Yogi under any circumstance including selling cowboy boot you know any transforms everything
 and let's see what Christian how Krishna moves you after you after you pass that test Chris is going to give you another opportunity
 most likely make a little harder cuz someone will nastier and be surprised
life is short
 do something you love to you know you can also start to desire how can I serve in a better wet you don't really refined your desire to how you want to serve what's important how you would like that time how you want to raise your family I like Eileen shared something on the checkpoints saying even notice that I'm you haven't felt like I'm lost or going or not at all right I'm right here with you so she's saying that to say a prayer to Christian before tough interactions meetings projects and saw that it's really powerful no doubt you know and I think I shared on the show before that there was one and it was it was it was a day around Christmas time which meant we would sell lots of books on those days
 and I was going to train station in a mother call at 9th Street
station or some what is it in Philadelphia it's his like their Grand Central Station feelings that are like you know
 it's beautiful beautiful and you had a panic attack know I have no cannatech I knew that on this day I could do big serves like lots of people buy books you know cuz it's just like lots of people traveling and but I said to myself I know that the way Krishna works is you always put some test early on comes early on to see where it is an opportunity to set your conscience for the day right yeah I give you blow it the whole days like attention Ali just like on a lower level is like riding high above the gooners next step
so that day even before before going out I just like the test will come when the test comes I will pass the test do not like that song thinking right and so and for some reason we found a tiny charger reaches this very end I don't think you were I don't know cat you were maybe was I have a great meltdown never great at 30th Street Station to go ahead okay so so so the very first man I walk to he was like you know one of these kind of walking fast businessman kind of power suit kind of guys
 and I just walked up answer you know and I and I held out that she Tony charging rate and without even stopped and he took it out of my hand and long that thing
 play Chief Keef
feeling so high like it was like a Hail Mary pass in football game or something like that and then you know what I'm watching you know they hit the grand want sense it's it's so heartbreaking to see someone treat something so sacred to that way but
 I knew that was a test and I just looked and said that would have broke me I would have been home but I was so quick this is a point I was prepared for it right I was prepared I prepared myself for that so I wasn't expecting that but I was I said I know test is coming be ready for it the very first guy and so you know he threw that book and I just said okay so you have a nice day anyway and then I went and picked up the book and when I pick up I felt like you don't know how surcharged I felt with real Christmas and that's it and I was like nothing stopping me now you know like nothing
can this isn't Lionel arjuna's out on that Battlefield by the end of the by the end of the bug of agita
 is a night and I have heard you when I'm ready to carry out your orders you know he's like he's fixed and when we get there and again it can even be why you're selling cowboy boots you know I'm fixed in remembrance of you today Krishna and nothing's going to stop me and I expect us to come I welcome those tests because those tests an opportunity for me to demonstrate my devotion to you so please you know I'm ready to serve you can bring them on that that's a powerful state of conscious and you can bring that into any job

 I and I'm going to be hated by every Harry Krishna for this but I never liked public just booked a situation cuz I only just felt like there's better ways to spread this holy name because shoot that was supposed to be serviced it needed it very well it would get out there and meet people but I was like kind of want to go out onto the street and get in people's face I don't like when people do it to me but this one month it was a Christmas Marathon I sent you know I don't
 go ahead and Krishna is such a clever little rascal that you're going to do this all going to hang out with all the book distributors and I got to go out with him and I
under Krishna and it says great tomorrow we're all going to the film

 we went to 30th Street Station maybe we were together but that was that same year we did all Josh found so I found a heart attack so I was probably doing a hard Bound in a project have any hardbound penis so I was doing
PhD and book distributors less than anyway so so 30th Street Station no one's rushing around where they do the train station you just sit there and wait for the numbers to change on the board and so I was like I would like to buy a bug of agita and the guys like know and like
