 and that's it for now so you know what today went very very special get some of that we want to have on the show for a long time and we finally got around to making it happen it's Chris chaitra Swami who's some of that I've known for many many many years and summative always deeply admired as a as a senior a sea as ever not see it as a scholar and it most most particular just says it as a yoga is a box of Yogi Chris and chips only welcome to the show
 thank you so much cuz tuba I'm happy and I must say honored to be here with you that the honor is all ours but I feel a little bit intimidated by the the title of year
podcast wisdom of the sages okay where do I fit into this we always try to make it clear from the first show that when we say wisdom of the ages we mean that the sages are in the pages of the srimad bhagwat time so we're presenting them but certainly you you you you would you would live up to our standard of a wise sage and that's why we broke up to the extent that I tried to let some of that wisdom from the body would tone rub off and counts is certainly does a little bio about you if you don't mind so it's it's a perfect day to Swami's is a vaishnava but yoga since 1972
 and a disciple of Sheila AC bhaktivedanta Swami prabhupada in 2014 he accepted the form of a louse of a
Nasi of a lifelong renuncia monk has a box of Yogi he completed his PhD at the University of Oxford with a study of vaishnava Temple liturgical practices in theology a research fellow of the Oxford Centre for Hindu studies and research fellow of the Oxford Center for animal ethics
 as a co-director I always greatly admire ethical animals and I don't know how you communicate with him about ethics but that said no course it has to do with how we treat animals what I'm sure you could communicate with them in all different ways he was he eat as a co-director
 of the Bhagavad is it the back of a piranha
 read project research project is co-director the bag out of the back of a product research
project along with Professor Ravi and Goethe and together they edited a volume of Articles and translated volume of selections of the back of a piranha the show me a bob with time that we read here every day on the show are both Farms are published by the Columbia University press on his books include attending Christmas image to Tanya bison of a mortise Ava as devotional truth the bottle by piranhas sacred texts and living tradition Cow Care in Indian in in Hindu animal ethics and advancing across the Great River Reflections on yoga philosophy and cross-cultural comparisons and those books they go by your the name that you use in your academic world Kenneth R V a I have I have two hats okay I switch them back and forth sometime
play when you walk into the University or professor and when you walk into the temple your Krishna kshetra Swami something like that something like that but certainly all your studies seem to be in the in the realm that's related to your devotional life
 yes and I feel quite fortunate that I've been able to bring these two worlds together so to say yeah yeah yeah yeah did you find that to it it seems to me that when I first started practicing Bucky back in ball in the late 80s and through the 90s I always got the impression of it and you know what is a distant impression so it may not be so accurate but that the the academic world was a little bit more hostile to
religion and spirituality and maybe it's a it's a bit more open to it now
 yes I would say so I've been fortunate in my
 time that I've been in the
 academic world I've been fortunate to to connect with
 Scholars who I would say our are very much religiously spiritually inclined some of them very much committed to their own Traditions my doctoral supervisor I think you know Frank Clooney I have met him before yes yeah he is of course a very committed at Roman Catholic but he's also a scholar of Bison of ism
yeah he is especially known for his comparative Theology and which he's been the Trailblazer anyway he's one example of such a person I found very how to say maybe accommodating but you get all kinds
 and I've always known you were such a gentle person so I'm happy that at least some of receive you in it and honor your your genuine devotion and in the world that you operated as an academic
 especially what I would like to get into today Maharaj is speaking but you know we read Trivago time of year on a daily as with Anastasia so it's a study you know it has its educational function for us
and we come here to learn lessons it's also a solid enough for us it's it's a daily practice by through which we intend to purify our minds purifier thoughts uplift our minds and hearts so it's so this text become so it is so fundamental to our or podcast in our community can say our daily gathering in in in yoga circles particular in the Western World certain books are well-known of course bug of agita perhaps you know the most well-known book and of course a very important text to us his bucket Yogi's yogurt yoga sutras are very You Know spoken of often
 but we don't hear Schumann box that do you know most people who aren't even familiar with that name the Sherman Bob some of the Bhagavad piranha but of course it's such an important text could you just speak a little bit about the a
what is unique about it why is it considered important let's see where to start one of the one of the sages of the go device not a tradition you've probably referred to sometimes here is San Antonio Swami one of the six goswami 7.6 go swimming and
 a road and an amazing Book of Prayers in which he at the very end or almost end of the book as I think it's 5
 5 versus 5 stanzas raising the body of a ton
 and one of these
been trying to memorize let's see if I can do it paadam on under the hood.
 Sorry about the service said yeah she krishnaiah to may I can I try to translate that sure give me the first line again on a month on the papaya so that the highest Bliss
 is drive-thru hearing it something like that yes you could say like that is in the second line
 Prema varshi aksharaya
 well it helps you do you see Prima by your eyes you see Through The Eyes Of Love
we give you credit for good try okay maybe I should just give up now so a nakshatra is a Sanskrit letter literally means that which cannot be broken but it refers to the Sanskrit alphabet OK and varsha is is rain and Marshall Auction is a rain of the letters do unto you whose reign of letters brings Prema bring the seal
 Canon lens server the service save ya
 you give you give everything you give service
or something like that
 good try. Okay. Savor of course means service but say it means to be served and so
 and sarvodaya means always sorry. Okay bye. And in service so and sarva means also you are always survivable by everyone I'll call the Falcon like another was always
 always worthy of service from everyone there's no one that's beyond the the
there's no one Beyond you that's Dion's to the role of your servant exactly there's there's no one who there's no excuse everyone can serve you okay interesting
 and then just Shay Krishna and the most ass to May until Cristiano
 I assume met
 how to Krishna I offer my respects us something but yes but because the prayer is to the bottom of the time it's saying that you are Christian
 who are the Glorious or the opulent Krishna SRI Krishna Nama amazin's us to let there be
 May by me
okay okay so the whole translation
 all of that together and I was just giving the body of the tongue brings the Supreme Bliss by reading it it is a shower of Prema
 with every letter with every word it's it's can be served or you can be served because it's all in the dative case it's addressing the by the time you can be served by everyone at all times
 and and you are this you are Lord Krishna to you I offer basins beautiful
when I hear a voice like that the meter reaction can be like oh it's a it's a it's a verse of Praise it's using that language of praise and and it's natural that when we give praise there's always you know all that honor and Glory being spoken of but I would imagine it also all of these things are very specific as well like another words to say part of mine under that you give the highest Bliss
 it refers not only is not only just like a a glorification but it's it's comparing that Bliss to Bliss that may be found elsewhere
 yes part of me is you can't get better than Parma I suppose what I'm getting at is would you would you view that as like a direct statement to 10 like in other places and other Tech
Steven and the other Vedic texts and in the other piranhas and so on it speaks about Bliss that can be derived in different ways but the Bliss of bhakti that's found especially in particular in the bag with time is something Beyond Sade like the Bliss of Brahman that you might find another text
 certainly he's saying that but he's also I'm I was saying this comes at the end of his book she Krishna Lila stubba is addressing Krishna in the entire I think it's more than 400 versus all in the pocket of case that means he's directly addressing the Lord and praising him through by referring to him in terms of his different Lila's in his different pastimes all of which are
described in the body at 10
 and so he's saying in effect just look at all of this place that you've experienced by re-reading about Trisha now just imagine you can also go to the bog latam directly and this is you'll find more of this and more I say I say okay beautiful thank you yeah this is a topic that kind of fast makes me just as being a person that kind of speaks about Bucky and speaks in yoga circles in the western world like this
 this key in a sense that's given to us through the srimad bhagwat time where
 there are so many texts so many texts coming in from the same author from Beyonce from Beyonce Diva and it seems to be recommending so many different ideas
you know said so many different practices and or even General categories of teaching you know of each with a different purpose and Connolly those get categorized into like the caramel condia you know like people that see this world as a as a place for their own enjoyment and but they want to approach it in the wisest and most harmonious way with nature so their rituals and so on that they can perform to to receive all the blessings material blessings in this world and then there's like the books that's you know like more like you punish odds that speak to Kiana that's it let's really Analyze This World let's analyze the material happiness that we've been driving through our sacrifices is there are rituals and recognize that with all whatever pleasures of this world we receive that there's always suffering that comes along with them in the wiser person
just let's go over these things and then but then there's something still you know beyond that there's this box teachings that's even that renouncing of this world is in one sense it's very accomplished if one can achieve that but it still hasn't gone to our very essence which is divine love and if the ball with time goes there you know one thing you're what you just said reminded me of another verse in the Bible that tongue in the first Canto toward almost I think the end of chapter 3 describing sort of the situation in which the volume that summarizes it's compared to the the rising of the sun Krishna
 sidamo pocket a Diamond by Rihanna.
that croissant has Departed the world but he didn't the parts alone he took with him Dharma and Ghana he took all the good things that we are what we think are good in this world it took them with him and so what to do a couple of nuts to Bridgeton Bridge from Asia in this age of Kali and which Christians not there in which Dharma & Greg on knowledge and religiosity are no longer there so then then what
 Colones additional major put on Arco I do not deter now I do not
 mudita has arisen
 this piranha ARCA this
piranha sun and Chris it's referring to the magnets on that's giving this image of
 the bottom of the time being like the sun brilliant like the sun it rises and makes everything clear
 you earlier speaking you know yet obviously such a large text
 and I even like say the bug of agita which is nearly 700 versus people commonly speak of a bug of agita that text that you can go back to again and again and again throughout your life and it's you know uncannily people find that it speaks to them in different ways on deeper levels they see things they understand things that they didn't understand before inserting with text like bug time which is you know so many thousands of verses and
what's in an infinitely deep there's going to be so many ways that we can read it and so many thoughts lessons ideas blessings that we can derive through it you were speaking to me about something that I had no one had ever kind of reveal to me before but you were speaking about different ways that people are received in the Bog of time and ideas that we can derive for that could you speak a little bit about that
 okay yes this is this is kind of one of my favorites
 favorite ways of appreciating the bottom of the tongue as I've over the years gone through it to me this is something that keeps coming coming out and calling calling my attention it's what in literary circles might be called a trope
a a certain sort of form of of narrative or having some essential features
 so what I find in the Bible of Thomas this in so many different in so many different ways how many different forms would I call the Trope of reception
 or the Trope of hospitality but it's it's one which has invariably a positive or in other cases of negative presentation
 what am I mean by this well let's start with the the
 the negative case
 of the king
 montage parody
it's in the end of the first Canto is out hunting as kings are wont to do he's been chasing a deer cording to the Mahabharata he has wounded and deer and the deer has run run off and he's chasing
 and as he's chasing me comes to an ashram and it's the Ostrom of Shameka Shamika Richie at that time is is is you could say very busy. How is he busy he's busy being completely absorbed in meditation so he's like in a trance essentially well that's the question okay we come to understand yes he
in a trance or at least and again this goes to the Mahabharata he has made a vow of silence okay
 so the king comes he doesn't know any of this the king is tired he's hungry and he's thirsty and he's the king so he's accustomed to being received with all honors and now he's being completely and thoroughly
 ignored
 and what is his response he he feels some impatience and he wants to show his impatience
 and there happens to be a dead snake lying nearby he takes it up with the tip of his bow and he drapes it over
the neck of the sage and he turns away and leaves in a huff that was kind of a almost like a sarcastic way of cooking garlanding someone like you would Garland to guess with flowers who's kind of like all you received me so well let me receive you well innocence is that what you say yes you could say it like that there's there's a there's a
 kind of circuit a kind of irony in it and of course says I think most of your listeners will know what happens is that the king is cursed by the son of this Sage what is the cars that he will he will die in 7 days
 and the king is informed of this and in the Bible
and I have to say this is
 a little difference description than in the Mahabharata but that's another topic he fully accepts The Cure's he says all right that's it it's time to go and he prepares himself he leaves everything is kingdom and he goes to the bank of the the ganga or is it that you move I never know it's hard to figure that one out right cuz he was in hastinapur which is Deli so you think could be but it says ganga as we know there he needs Shuka we call him and Shook and Ava took a David goswami
 where it's a complete opposites sort of reception in this case
 now he the key
except area is receiving the sage
 and the sage like Shamika is not saying anything
 but
 he's immediately recognized for what he is at his exalted a sage who can fully respond to the needs of the king in his final days of preparing to die
 but going back to the the first reception or failed reception if you like
 what I think is interesting here and which is interesting in many of the we might say troubled receptions in the boggart time is that there is some assumption made
there is a misperception there is a judgment made which turns out to be inaccurate inappropriate Disney in this case
 the king is suspicious that the sage is not really meditating that he just wants to avoid having to deal with receiving him too much trouble and we've all felt that way perhaps
 yeah one of one of the sort of related theme to this there is this idea in the
 broadly speaking they take and post Vedic literature that especially for householders and in this case Shamika is
Ricci and he's also a household is that it's considered a very important duty to receive guests not just invited guests not just Rhian announced but unexpected guests and is this is sometimes referred to as a teacher saver a service to an unexpected guests and there is the the the understanding that particularly an unexpected guests just might be the Supreme Lord himself in this guy's just to test us all right
 and so the especially the household is enjoying door is encouraged to be ready and to read heaven
any one's sense of welcome I am fortunate to have this guest
 and indeed I see this guest as a representative of the Lord and my home is is being blessed by this person and so on so there are many there's so many different occasions in the pocket of time if we if we jump to the third Scandal the third canto
 the four camaras against ages now course the bottle of time it's very much about Kings and sages meeting yes though as again I'm sure your listeners know the four camaras are on a tour to visit vaikunta they've gone through six of the seven Gates of my contacts and
to being the spiritual world you can say exiting the material and entering the spiritual realm of devotion
 and these four stages are appearing like five year old or less children and being who they are and their uniform is their skin they are completely naked
 and giant BJ who are the guards at the door of the Pearly Gates and they say wait where do you think you're going can you get your nuts you don't know the dress code and there's some sharp words exchanged and and that leads to an extended Pastime as
they will these two guards will have to leave their position to come to the temporal world where they are going to be the cause of so much trouble and then they will be met by the Lord who will personally end their lives not once but in three different lives all of that starts by an awkward reception
 Island that starts with a misperception
 of these four stages they don't know that these are sages and you could you could imagine you can ask yourself or what if they had responded in a different way what if they had said excuse me can you kindly identify
by yourselves and you know they could have had a polite discussion right instead of saying. You cannot come in
 so
 making presumptions and then acting in ways which have a high-cost is something which you find in the piranha she met several times I would say that it's there's a you know a domino effect 11
 bad words one bad action and it leads to so much trouble
 another reception that another problematic reception yeah my mind goes for the troubles
talk about this we can also talk about the nice receptions in the back of the tongue but another troubles one is that Indra this is in the sixth Canto Indra is in his Palace and he's the Lord of is sometimes called the king of Heaven
 and he's surrounded by his admirers and the dancing girls are dancing in the singers are singing and his his Guru walk
 Ambit Indra is his teacher walks in but his his teacher but Indra does not notice
 because he's distracted so it would have been proper for him to stop everything immediately to stand and to offer obeisance
to his scooter pre-hospital but he completely ignores them for your husband. He sees the situation and he quietly leaves
 apps relieves injure understands oh I blew it
 and he tries to fix it but it's too late
 and the consequences are practically endless they go on for chapter after chapter yeah still in this case in a what is the lesson the lesson is that you can say be careful about being in a situation where you find yourself
 let's say in the focus of attention by admirers or depreciate hers are friends and someone who
ought to be respected you neglect
 as a result and that could be a simple
 Kaze no let's go to a good reception and go back I don't write enough bad news I think for a while is
 Naruto's mother in his previous life we never we never hear what her name was
 for whatever reason but she has received
 the sage has several stages we don't know the number but apparently if you know a few of them Swami prabhupada calls them the back TV doctors
so she receives them apparently for some time during the rainy season and and hosts them
 and serves them in so many different ways and her son and we don't know his name before he becomes Nara. But has her son he assist her and well he's assisting her he is of course benefiting from their sunga from their Association
 and and that becomes his sort of ticket to eventually in his next life become Naruto so in this is one good reception one positive Hospitality leads to in a glorious a glory
rocori Sage amongst the day of his in his next life and yes and then threw the bottle at some gnarly that is giving so much spiritual teaching there's several times
 Marsh couldn't let me ask you something focusing on the side you you you open the shop by using the word hospitality and so it in your drawing our attention to where is the people are greeted involved with them in such an important tax that's really the combination we we understand it as a combination of all of the yoga philosophy that yesterday gives us an edge in your your drawing our attention to to say it look look at that text where we finally get to the full conclusion of it it's giving us examples of
 receptions people greeting others word liberal looking at the hospitality the quality of the hospitality of different people and we're seeing that
how it will there's a focus on that
 and and you mentioned how in India just in general in India this idea has been deeply instilled I think you still find that many times in India I've been invited to stay to eat to or even to stay in the homes of people that had just met me right there just like you please, save my own there there's there's such a a conviction that's been instilled that this will bring auspiciousness to them to their family if they honor people this way and I was wondering you know one of your fields of study and end in practice is the temple worship
 you know this is the ritual Saturday on within a temple where in different offerings are made to the forms in the temple
as offerings made to God and there we see that there's offerings that is within the ritual sometimes it's 16 offerings are made sometimes it's 64 offerings that are made but they seem to align very much with the mood of how you would receive a guest in your home that's the types of things that are offered in perhaps the mood that one should have
 that's what it says that's what it's very much about archana as it's called and it's sort of umbrella term for temple temple worship is it can be understood
 and in terms of hospitality but in this case it's hospitality for none other than God and it's so it it seems that again
we come to this what we understand is the Pinnacles are the cream of all the Vedic teachings the the commentary
 on the vedanta Sutra which is you know the essence of all they don't and when we get there certainly philosophy is there certainly is a deep philosophy is there but it's being expressed through through quite a few examples of hospitality that I guess you could say
 the state of one's heart
 as expressed through greeting another human being and that that's somehow become so essential to the practice of yoga yes because what is Yoga one way to understand it is as a process of purifying the core of our being in the yoga
pictures of patanjali is referred to again with a kind of umbrella term namely chipped and so
 we can think of yoga as the process he says y'all got stripped of everything he wrote it out to sort of drawbacks from the the prettiest engagements that the fluctuations of the night but what is why is that important because we're looking for the purity of the heart of chitta which is often translated as heart Chitto is kind of an aggregate of money has Beauty And The Honky and sometimes I'm 30 I'm in this refer to so technical terms for mind and intelligence and and the the idea of
being the door I hung up but in the body of a time what becomes much more clearer I think then in patanjali yoga sutras who's kind of pointing in this way but you know how he is being very
 little bit cryptic is the idea is to clear the hearths to welcome in the heart the Lord that the Lord as a host to receive a guest and it said exactly and of course in this case we can say yes but the Lord is already there yes but you don't know it we haven't received the reception the process that's there in the
 richell ritual literature is really pointing toward that I D
so is giving this in narrative form and where where the where the receptions go wrong it's it's a in a practical yes you version of its showing what to what to avoid
 so this is very interesting to me so in other words we met
 we may pick up on those same rituals are very similar types of ritual in The Vedas were the emphasis is on if you perform these rituals nicely you receive all the things of this world yo-yo you can have the birth of a healthy child you can have range for your crops you can have wealth you could have a very auspicious birth in your next life for the pleasure and you can learn those rituals but when we get to the bar with time
 you can speak about the same or similar rituals but from a much deeper understanding
has to do with preparing your heart to receive god with the deepest type of love and a sheep the very highest goal in life yes that's what I would say if you if we go to the third Canto I think it's chapter 28 there's an amazing meditation it's like a guided meditation on the form of Vishnu
 going step-by-step from the feet in a load of speeds gradually up the body to the to the face to the to the smile to the to the laughter of the Lord and all of this is It's a meditation its specific it's in the context of yoga as meditation so there I think it becomes very explicit pet
what did Viola Thomas offering
 very itchy and end in that I'm sure it's something that you haven't heard of a grub enough and I we always Sheridan and last but there's one comedian you know current you know modern popular comedian and he did one he was doing a stand-up routine
 and he was comparing what Hospitality was like when he was growing up to what it is today
 and he was saying you know when I was a kid you know when someone came to your door that was like a good thing and and we called it company you know they were having company today they could they could just drop in unexpected and and your mother always kept like some crumb cake in the house that you weren't allowed to touch because company might come and you had to be ready for them when they come in their maker
Sanka and and there's some crumb cake and everyone would gather around and be silly, we haven't seen you in so long it's so great to have you and then he said nowt nowadays today if someone knocks on your door everybody's like Duck did you invite anybody over who is that and so can we never lock the door yeah sure unless we were going away for some days the whole family otherwise door was unlocked and I find it really interesting that when we get again we're getting to the sum that idea in Indian culture
 that I think in and maybe you can speak to this a bit but it seems to me like
 there's things that people look at him call them superstition
and in in a tradition may even kind of like solidify a super certain super superstitious ideas for our own good
 you know like this is there there may be sitter and superstitions we have around the house you know in terms of its cleanliness or its organization or something and end in their Promises of auspiciousness if you if you do it right and inauspicious sense if you don't just so that we become more Suffolk and in our habits and so on and and then we hear the you know the unexpected guest
 should be treated like God just arrived at your door right and then once it's maybe the people that are doing their things this could be God and I better be careful and you know I got to do everything right but perhaps more essentially what it's saying is that we should see God in everyone and and we should cultivate that that deep spiritual realization
through being very eager to serve guest in receive guests and then when we get to that alternate book you know of yoga it's it's showing that again and again in different ways exactly and of course especially as I kind of suggested it's understood this is due to you of the householders yeah they're raised on that's the reason they exist is to in up to accommodate others
 that's that that's such a beautiful point you know one of the reasons we wanted to have you on today March was the highlight of course that you are sharing a long time with Professor Ravi Gupta people that have been listening I've been referring to to rub you go to write equipment for Booze he's also a
an Oxford scholar have been referring to the tapes that I've been listening to him a lot recently tapes that were recorded there they're available on YouTube if you if you Google radhika Ramen or rugby go to end IBS to iskcon or ISP is can still come Valley he's giving some wonderful a few different wonderful courses there but the two of yours are coming together to present an online course for the Oxford Center for enriched studies that are available to everyone and their course is called back about piranhas sacred texts and living tradition and I'll just briefly read the description of this is says a Viber an example of living a literature the back of a piranha often referred to as soon as Bob and Tom is a hugely popular Hindu sacred texts written in Sanskrit verse it is inspired major North Indian bhakti traditions as well as schools of dance and drama and continues to permeate popular Hindu art and ritual in India
the in India and the diaspora in this course we examine the back of a prize key themes and its extensive influence on Hindu thought and practice first we'll see how the text of Elvis major Hindu philosophical ideas social dynamics psychological the psychology of self-realization and cosmology all with a central focus on devotional bhakti to the Supreme specifically as Vishnu noralina Krishna we will then look at the text as a living tradition through various media including or recitation traumatic and dance performance and by translation and publication in & Beyond India is courses based on the edited collection bottle by piranhas sacred texts and living tradition students will receive an electronic copy of the book
 this course is produced by the books editors professor of a good turn dr. Kenneth l p
 and will also
we will also be tutoring a course first presentation April 2024 so this is a course that begins at the end of this month it's an online course I highly recommend this week we read back what time every day together here on the podcast and if you would like to take that interest a bit deeper so that when you come when you hear the park as you understand it on a level that you haven't previously I would highly recommend this course it begins the way that works I really like this form and study cuz I was fortunate to to be able to take part in some of the horses that the Oxford Centre for indigenous studies put together call the the Gaudi vaishnava studies program
 and it isn't a similar method hear that there's a there's a video that you can watch a little different from what you experience but yes it was similar in the sense that you you can do your own study you can prepare yourself with your own study and there's on
and these videos that you can watch on your own time and then there are five tutoring sessions that are taking place they begin in late April April 29th and they go through early June and Stu June 2nd it's a wonderful way to study and and you know really the most qualified teachers on this sofa to find that you can go to the to the website is Oxford Centre for Hindu studies online ochs online.org and you can search for the Bhagavad piranha sacred texts and living tradition and I also like that in the show notes do you like to share as our time is winding up well thank you for plugging a hard course I couldn't have done it better
and and thank you for having me on this. It's just it's so nice what you're doing at your you're reaching so many so many of them just the right people I think with your podcast so all power to you keep it up now thank you so much for that blessing you know it is a wonderful group of people and I hope I have received you a somewhat well here this morning and that I may receive your blessing thank you so much for coming out today real pleasure to have you here will you be coming to the United States anytime soon for the rest of this year but as soon as possible
