Second Chances with you no working on the book is kind of my top priority you though I can't say give it more time that I stay until the saying her but I'm starting to get a little bit back in the group so I feel about that I can be your accountability if you like, how would that work you text me okay I'm doing 10 pages today I'm five pages today. Distracted today if you need to send a text message you like to read it and go a little back and forth or is that like I don't know if you just want to

 still spaces available for the wisdom of the ages retreat at Super Soul farm and Italy but they're both filling up fast if that's true now it's getting real I'll still be there if you're one of those people that make plans in advance not like not like me flying by the seat of my pants you know next year we're doing that 300 hour and it's on my website 3:00 in India you do the training we're also do we have 200 our training Lori Pags going to be there during the 200 hour it's me Bobby Cindy and then also we have the kirtan academy going on and we have a second Academy that studying redundant to never wanted to learn more dunga a pro

 and then the wisdom to sages Retreat happens also the last two weeks and right after the feel like I wasted we do our mayapuri treat for a week in that we just you know we did like a test run this year and it was very nice very nice retreat in Maya pour
 and I've ever wanted to get away and just want us to retreat we can just it's not such a huge
 financial commitment or time commitment cuz it's only a week and it's very very special especially if you're already in the box if you've opted in like this is for me than my poor makes so much sense and you know it's it's very special experience
 that's all
 yes sir
 who's it from
Richard Kipling
 do you know who murdered Rodger Kipling wrote Animal Farm
 Joseph Rudyard Kipling was an English novelist short story writer poet and journalist he was born in
 India British India he was actually born in Mumbai in 1865 I would have loved to be led by an 18650 is jungle beautiful jungles is got that old Shiva Temple their problems attempting to Portuguese Port it was enough
 yeah I would love to have been able to see that so anyway so yeah that's where he was born which is interesting and I want to hear this nugget
 it makes me think this is a person that was likely in India
I like it sounds like someone that was in India imagine the people that you would need in in Mumbai in 1865 and you could my guess is you can be the kind of person that he's talking about it in this quote yeah it must have been a special time
 America was I just wrapping up a Civil War and you was born there and so he hears his and this is yeah beware of over concern for money or position or glory of the things that people hunted out they serviced it might become a little bit more glorious more powerful word validated More Love by the masses how can I become a little more wealthy how can I find my Edge upon somebody else my privilege upon somebody else
someday you'll meet a man who cares for none of these things
 then you will know how or you are super powerful than you could imagine that the British were in India and exploiting it for its resources and dominating a few come in and dominate The Many and
 that's what they're looking for these things money position glory and
 then you stumble into a sage who has none of those things this is this is a different type of privilege this is a privilege you have to opt-in for and turn off your senses and turn your mind towards spirit and then you have the highest type of one-upmanship but any will end your completely detached you can't be purchased you can't you can't be hurt you can't be triggered you can't be
you covered it was if you were if you were living in a place like Bombay of the 1860s or seventies or eighties growing up in that certainly there's you're going to be plenty of people that were deeply deeply immersed in a Wandering sadhoos what's a speak of other deep you know spiritualist you know people who practice a real real practitioners you know without so much of the distraction that we have nowadays
 and you know I really feel what he's saying it's like $0.01 okay anybody that's talked a little bit about spirituality is going to say okay money is
I was going to bring you happiness and in someone with enough
 but the way that he conveys that I feel like there's some
 there's some realisation some genuine deep appreciation you know because it's what is picking up on it said these people had a treasure right
 and when you get when you don't when you meet that person that has that treasure and you don't have it
 you could phrase it this way
 what it makes one feel what is it that I'm missing this created some emptiness in me that's driving me to see fulfillment through these externals
 because it's you know that seems to me like these are the things that bring happiness this person does not have them
 but has something more you know there's a course that story Sonata goswami where he's got this
mystical Touchstone ride and get whatever you want if you touch it and insult someone hears about that and goes to him and he's just sitting there what's what's what's his tragedy and he's chanting you can please give me your Stones giving you stuff so I can take the stone where is it
 then once again the stone still where you were with the stone who's in the refuse pile and you just had a line around and go take it
 this is
 yeah and then he had it then he was so it was working
 he's getting his external desires fulfilled by the mystical power this Stone and then he realized but there's something like who is not refuse pile what does he have more that you send them more if he gave that up so easily switch set them up so she said about snotsucker Swami sez
I'll give you something more valuable but you got to throw away the stone take a message or what's behind curtain number one and that's what he did it doesn't cost any money but if there's a price to pay you or do you have to pay the price was you have to throw the stone into the river and then you got it and went and you got the prize and it's the holy name I don't want to let me offer you a lawnmower or do you like to take the lawn more or what is behind curtain number one and it's like that was just like a blind gambling kind of thing right that was just like I don't know if this is going to be something better behind that car here is a person and this is what it must have been like in the romanticizing AM by but there's not a few there's a lots
these men Dickinson ashrams and they appear like self-satisfied detached cultured refined that's not the British culture son a Christian culture per se but their refined and knowledgeable and it's attractive and anyone who is just not boldly into wealth and power at cetera it start to take what do they have we live in this world right now you know I can look around on the zoom screen or saying I'll look what's in her house look was in his house and I can I purchase that that looks cool and I want these things to sort of like decorate my ego
 to be sort of like a necklace I wear around me check out the stuff I have thinking that will give me something and when you meet a person who has nothing but they're actually joyous they're actually connected it's so attractive and you think man I've done so much.
established by my stuff at the center stage and some people really that really refined things and it's a new way to measure success a new way to measure it because this is a privilege that you can't purchase you can't inherit it you can't no one can give it to you you have to totally decide I'm going to I'm at I want this for myself and I'm going to do what it takes to get it and what it does it takes in the qualifications to purchase it
 is humility I can purchase you you have a beautiful piece of furniture I think they look great at my house I can purchase that you have a nice outfit on I'll purchase that you got a cool watch I'll purchase that car I can purchase that I can purchase all these things but I can't purchase that type of connection that the episode of has I can only purchase it through devotion of my heart
that's very powerful and that's what you offered to us through the bog of time you can have it but you got to give your heart to it it's nothing you can do it and then you swipe it and really have to give your heart to it exclusively right that no one else Falls within the realm of your faction but your affection to others goes through your exclusive devotion all the other things that we consider privileges you know a person might be very wealthy a person might have come from a very wealthy family person might be incredibly knowledgeable as an academic and I can say I will all academically apply myself to Krishna Consciousness great still not at you can't purchase it with all these material privileges that some people are born into or some people earned by some other work or going to school you can only
purchase it through devotion of the heart that's what is right about this morning right now really
 yes I do yes I do this will be my reading up his pubis today exactly cuz what I was I was writing about that there's this
 exclusive or you could take confidential aspect of a Toronto right there's a higher qualification understand
 the knowledge of conventional vedanta has been widely elaborated on to the writings of the yoga tradition
 along with the attributes that qualify one to simulate his teachings and realize it's message
 so this practice is like we're done CA Chien attachment extolled is corrective measures to counteract a move on cuz this is right to get Reggie point I think about this confidential vedanta
 this this message appear bhakti which is
unique with it all the bug of agita speaks of confidential they don't using terms like Ghoulia tamam sjostrom the most confidential part of the sacred text Rodger William the greatest of all secrets
 the secret teachings are not locked away in a guarded library or buried in a crypt they flow like a river
 I'm sorry I'm running the wrong part I like it anyway okay if I want to get to the part that talks about the purity of the heart cuz that's exactly what you were just talking about
 oh yeah practices like 19th and attachment extolled is corrective measures to counteract the attachments that cloud the objectivity needed to perceive truth
 attachments fear or resentment May trigger resistance when the implications of Truth rub up against one's desires or predispositions one's capacity for reason may be diverted from the direct Pursuit Of Truth and engage in defending the validity of ones
attachments
 other attributes like Simplicity austerity obedience to the qualified teacher or recommended for the Seeker
 but there's a further qualification understand confidence of a dungeon has nothing to do with self-discipline scholarship for power of intellect and everything to do with the state of one's heart
 right that's the heat that's the point is that the point that you're making sure right there even even within the realm of a down to even within the realm of yoga you know the power of your renunciation the power of your are steroid the power of your intellect are all useful tools
 in in in advancing in in in one's I'm on the path but when it comes to this Divine love which is the greatest treasure that's the treasure you know that's the real treasure that completely Burns to the burns right down to the root the desires for money or position
Glory that that's only there it's through devotion and that devotion is so powerful that it is they say you know the sages they describing a different ways they say it's like drowning in an ocean of bliss they say it's like diving and surfacing you know that going to River flow a constant flow that and even physically they feel it like waves of ecstasy you know through their bodies the one you're feeling that
 money and position and Glory
 become incredibly pale that they have no no Allure whatsoever that's the person that has the well that's that's the person that has something very special some very special treasure that makes these other things so pale in comparison and I would imagine that Richard Kipling you know he probably bumped into some of these people you know maybe at the bubble not 10 minutes
we're doing that with the bubble now you know there's that verse 1st describing Krishna ugly thumb I chewed them on a Demon Hunter rupam his unlimited forms he's inconceivable he's one without a s n Dey Dey shoot dorla bomb at the show how do you understand this and conceal a person is very very difficult they did not to not through I'm not 38 made a study of beta you can't find it but it's it's it's very easily you can very easily find him throughout my back door through devotion of the saw and so this is everything this is the only thing you need and you know what it cost nothing because no no no nothing called nope ice in it doesn't cost any Sterling any gold what it costs devotion of the heart and then with devotion of a heart you can have everything is been amazing that's the only qualification you have the amount of schooling or education you can't even see it seems
I'll just study the latest I'll know Krishna no way there's a lot of people studying The Vedas and are so far away from Krishna cuz it's led by their you do it but when you give your heart then all of a sudden everything sort of unfolds and when these people you see someone who has that it's quite impressive and this I think this is perhaps why all of us are here is because we met a person at or heard about people that have some fire Vibe with none of the things that people of this world are chasing they have some higher VIP vibe
 and what happened to that
 you know Steph spiritual life them to walk the path is what it is is the steady
 engagement and accepting something and releasing something releasing something and then accepted something cutting something out bring you something new in you move up a step then you
you know what they're still stuff still stuff in my mind still stuff in my heart that needs to be removed or still certain habits that I have certain ways that I waste my time cut that out and break the next level then you get there then you then you begin to read then there should be a healthy kind of drive to come to the next stage is certain a certain lacking certain emptiness a certain time or or certain inspiration that makes me say you know what I need to cut this out and embrace the next time you go to your next step and it's just she said a ladder this one's like climbing like that step by step in in the more custom that we get to cutting out your the more you eat the more confidence that we develop when I cut that out I will not be the loser I will actually gained one has that's called face you know that I can take the Touchstone to throw it into the river because I have the faith
 that there's something more valuable
that that's right there that I can that I can grip I can Embrace in a pull into my life
 yeah it make her do material sense it makes tons of spiritual sense is asking on the
 on the chat who is this bubble not not bubble bubble bubble bubble know the name of Lord Shiva is the type of tree or Chivas it's under which she was the Lord of that tree and it's one of the oldest temples in Mumbai and it's a Shiva temple built on this hill which is now a very expensive neighborhood for the Hanging Gardens are it's near chowpatty beach and whenever we go to chowpatty like to visit that temple they're too old old charm yeah it's all marble and you can just tell even like marble you see how old it is
but the baby tomorrow looks like Florida but I always imagined a bunch of sawdust living on a hill worshipping a DND to before any of it was built well you know I'm a pi on that didn't like on the ledge what do I do you know like on the roof on all the different corners and along the edges of the roof it has those carvings of different style tattoos
 you know chanting japa meditating in different ways doing pranayama at school would be cool
 all right baby that was our life. Slaves could scuba think we're sitting there on the hill either that or we or some type of farm animal farm animal in the previous life I'm not quite sure all right continuing be awesome to do J on Monday right before deciding to shoot my bow but I'm witches are very sore
just a means of a means of Conquest when should I be respectful of base and seize the Supreme Lord Narayan until the Super most human being until yesterday the author messed up her usual about race Unity amaka by 2baba Tom and by rendering a service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome the heart will become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact, Jana tomorrow. I open a basin Seas
 it's a lot of sweet Rita from the shoe Maybach the time we can't just seven chapter 7 x 46 continuous
we're getting instructed by a five-year-old you know but we never finished 45 I think I think you were like $0.01 of it and I was it
 we got we drafted
 real estate this all this paraphernalia is very very dear as long as the body exists right all the stuff that we have that's the paraphernalia but as soon as the body is destroyed all things related to the body are also finished all that off to Goodwill all your valuable stuff you got
 boxes and boxes of children's Finger Paintings and photo album some old clothes no one wants got to cut some stuff out and it said of some new stuff brand furniture that you thought was really valuable or precious plant that I have bought that you never used so you just a few times it's just jug
junk junk collector this is talking about more than just the material Chinese song about even relationship is talking about your relationship was probably quoted this or proper coolant for something else but he was quoting when he was crossing the ocean Coming to America in your old age what do we have leftover sitting on her deathbed what do we have left all the people that we've ever met just comes down to a long list of names properly rotate interesting because in the shower and I bet it's like who are all these people that have been my life
 even my own family members you know who want it's just everybody I've ever met and we've had a lot of intimate brainly
Lancet relationships familial relationships
 are you here since we were kids where are they now it's just like a long list of names
 therefore therefore actually one has nothing to do with them you want is actually nothing to do with them but because of ignorance one accepts them as valuable that's the treasure
 I'm sorry Mara you're not that valuable
 you got to talk of the devotees association
 because what the devotees is it's their taking it out of the illusion if that's why there's actually some value there
Marisa Mike needs a little on the turn that off of talk loud and she doesn't talk into the mic cuz she's when you talk or are you can't just sit there and knit and then expect for people to know what you're saying it compared to an ocean now this is important compared to the ocean of Eternal happiness
 all these things are so insignificant what is the use of such insignificant relationships for the eternal
 living being okay this is the potency of of of a bhakti yoga because we're creating relationships that have an eternal value
 there's people that come into my life that have give me some type of Eternal even if I never meet them again they they've touched me in such a way that they would give me until it was eternally valuable conversation friendship relationship
Eternal value and you never forget them you never forget what they given to you
 you know these some metaphors
 ocean of Eternal happiness
 really pretty big the sandsprit is nitty on under
 Rosa
 who died today
 ocean of Russia
 that is resting meaning some nectar some delicious sweet taste that's nityananda it's a taste of bliss that is never-ending Eternal ocean of bliss when we go to the ocean when we look at it
 if we're in a bit of a receiving a little bit of a contemplatively mood is the vastness of it that's impresses us right
drops you know how many gallons is in a calculated to hold fast to practically on ending we could we could swim and swim and swim and never get to the end of it
 and you know some of my Pilates trying to help us understand with a metaphor like this
 that the things that you are searching for in this world to try to find your happiness
 there's really insignificant there is an ocean try to understand this try to try to develop explore this idea explore these teachings experiment with them and see if this faith will rise in you you know especially through connecting with other people that have that faith that are experiencing something more that there is a treasure there it's so vast that everything else that you're seeing as treasure in this life
 becomes insignificant you know it's a great blessing and
pregnant
 is when those insignificant things when you're no longer just telling yourself that but you actually feel it you know like I get it there's no taste there there's no nectar they're the things that I've been doomscrolling that I've been doing why am I still doing it there's no nectar here and then you stopped you know that that's that's what you can you cut something out you Embrace something you got to fill that was something else that you feel that with the Baga Tommy feel that with the Holy Name you feel that with association with the Saudis and and you bring yourself to the next level in your spiritual spiritual life now if we are going through a period of life where things are looking really up things are looking really good money is flowing in people love you you got material facility you've got to think deeply we got to think really deeply because it seems like one of your worlds pretty darn good I'm always talking about I'm leaving into these
I'm leaning in to buy whatever I want go wherever I want it's break beaches and I got lots of frequent flyer miles and deliver these have to really become philosophical because there will be a time perhaps in this lifetime where we got nothing and if unless we find some joy peace connection separate from those things we're going to ruin this opportunity nephew going through a tough time right now and some people are going through tough times money is not flowing you know we can't get what we want we can do what we want we're in a tough place can I create a bubble a piece of bubble of Joy a bubble a connection with no material opulence and see how that works and that's going to be interesting matter fact when you start getting stuff which happens Library switches on a dime sometimes
 can you keep bought can you find that peace and keep that peace and peace of mind and not living in Zayed and fear and worry what the heck where is how am I going to get fat and just
move forward one day at a time until you get to this next phase of every get everything can you still keep that bubble of Peace when surrounded by stuff it's really interesting because whether we are economically it a financially fulfilled or financially destitute there's different challenges we have to face because having and not having have nothing to do with the real treasure here
 we think about that stupid you got to make that bubble the bubble and then you become
 bubble knife lord of the bubble 46 son of a saurus that's who it is sure is a demonic being in these kids are all children of demons the living entity receives different types of bodies according to his previous fruitive activity
is that interesting you look the way you do cuz to buy like I'm looking at you right now see you
 do you look the way you did something you didn't something to get that body is that interesting way to think even if you don't believe it it's interesting to think like that and it was a little family you got a father that you had a mother that you had a sister like you had why cuz you've done something to get it you have some desires that led you there can I get your born in particular place you have different bracelet bracelet bracelet like we don't fight it don't it don't
 say why me or whatever just calling it this is my responsibility this is I got it myself I own it in that sense right I'm responsible we get lost even within the Western therapy we get lost or even in the East people look at their best of logical chart why did this happen
one of his family happen to me guess what you got what you got we got what we got let's move forward sometimes I look at animals
 and think of the human qualities that one lived
 that are fat body that brought them to that animal body some of them I think are humorous some of them are like really profound or you know really have Awakening potential you know you look at some of these creatures I think sometimes if I don't like gets serious by my wife I'm going to take birth of some type of goat in my next life ever hang out with everything that's eating everything. Out trying to satisfy but I got hole to think like a goat is nibble chew
everything was you know saplings anything growing just Munchen what is it there's nothing there's a bengalis saying I think
 there's nothing that a goat won't eat nothing that fool won't say don't see that all the kangaroo
 yeah those are Olympic jumpers their powerful beasts yeah they fight too but they're terrifying they can be terrifying and same time sure are the story of yoga with a kangaroo everyday well you know what I think we can we connect how to connect bit there were there it was a big kangaroos doing yoga every morning in the jungle in Australia and I'm kangaroos to come and sit and watch me
 Swatch I saw
it was scrolling off a bit now but I saw a video that other day this this speaks to the Consciousness the awareness that the quality of the Soul within the different bodies
 there was a video of some guy you know like how people have the sliding glass doors in the house so it is sliding glass door in a kangaroo came up to it did kangaroo standing up straight and it took its claw that claw nastiest thing I've ever serious weapon in a wallaby man I saw it was clawing up against the window like repeatedly and he felt like it's it's it's asking me you guys calling me help help yeah it wasn't saying like I hate you I'm killing it was like help me so he went out and he followed the kangaroo and if any
found that there is some other Kangaroos and there's like a gully and their little Joey very good baby kangaroo was slid into that Colleen was stuck
 and they had no way to get it out it says in the human like he grabbed the Joey by the arms and he was pulling and pulling it was hard to get it out and pulled and pulled in and finally got the thing out and the kangaroos were so great that they followed him home they gave him a gift or something
 they just kind of like can there and saw him every day and spend time with them everyday like they yeah they really recognize we came to you for help we knew that we couldn't do this herself with that you know they got together so we need a human right through that had that
halogens that had that Jamila T that had that appreciation and gratitude I didn't have the thumb or something like that to be able to grip something
 very good right now so a lot of saying what was his according to how we lived right we're thinking let me get the the same things that the word yard was speaking about let me get the money that the position the glory through my fruit of activities I do something I get the result let me work for them but we're getting all the results to that are determining the next body that we take
 does she seem to suffer less you seem to suffer with reference to his particular body and all conditions of Life beginning with his infusion
please tell me are for please tell me they are for after full consideration what is the living entities actual interest in fruit of activities which result in hardship and misery he's you know he's speak to an elite group to write like the sons of the high-level asaurus right you know cuz he's like the king the emperor's like the universal a real son he's not going to school with just not going to public school public school is a high private school with their sophisticated families there just ate the authority office so they all were being really trained up in the like go for it if you know you got it going to fruit of activity full-on achieve your materialistic goals find happiness through this type of materialistic treatment he's countering that
text 47-47 the living entity that's us it was received his present body because of his password of activity and the results of his actions in this life
 but this does not mean that he is liberated from bondage to material bodies
 the living entity receives one type of body and by performing actions that with that buddy he creates another is what we're doing every time we have a minute to act upon a desire work we're creating a Consciousness for another body the living entity receives one type of body and Performing actions with that the body he creates another I'm starting my seat rails my grades from one body to another through repeated birth and death this is the this is the mysteries of life right here because of his gross ignorance so he's saying that in this life you're burning off your previous Karma so it seems like okay I'm becoming free know you're not Liberty because
as your burning off your past, you're creating your future car me creating this was kind of like a caterpillar you're going from one life to the next
 the by the way little Corona has sent us the poem from Pearl pod that it comes from it's such a beautiful poem you got to put picture yourself you're on a boat on a ship a cargo ship I've never been on a cargo ship
 I never been a chef I don't think
 all I have is the opening stanza you were running through thought you were going to sink when it was also very that's right I guess that's a ship Valley poem from David Bhajan
 written by she'll prop on your reading the whole thing or just a stanza I have
stanzas all right we'll take it
 this is probably towards the end of his life last stage of his life kind of or you could say second this the last stage if you want to consider his retirement in Coming To America with nothing so he says I'm sitting alone in Randleman
 in this mood I'm getting many realizations
 I have my wife Sons daughters grandsons everything but I have no money so they are fruitless Glory
 Christmas Chao Chris and show me the naked form of material nature
 by his strength it is all become tasteless to me today we're just talk about that right when you lose taste for what you yes you're hum on a green army Irish is Issaquah from Bob, I gradually Christian saying High Grass
to take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful
 how was I able to understand this mercy of the all merciful everyone is abandon me see me as penniless why wife relatives friends Brothers everyone
 this is misery
 but it gives me a laugh I sit here alone and laugh
 in this Maya samsara in this cycle of Illusion whom do I really love
 where have my loving father and mother gone now
 and where are my elders who are my own fault
 who will give me news of them tell me who all that is left of this family life is a list of names
 as the frost on the sea water mixes again in the sea my samsara is plays just like that no one is Mother
father or personal relative just like the seafoam they remain but a short time just as the froth on sea water mixes again in the sea the body made of five elements meets with destruction how many bodies does the embodied Soul take in this way
 his relatives are all related merely to the temporary temporal body
 but everyone is your relative brother on the spiritual platform
 this relationship is not pinched with the smell of Maya
 the Supreme Lord is a soul of everyone
 in relation to him everyone in the universe has the same all your relatives Brothers
 all the billions of Divas when seen in relation to Krishna they are all in harmony for getting Christian of the Geva desire sense gratification and as a result is firmly grasp by Maya
poetic deep relevant in my own life
 list of names so many people I've had intimate friendships with and contacts and musicians that played with toured with a tour of the persons like you become their intimate friend are traveling together and tight circumstances lived in ostrom's with and then all the sudden like that same body that I treasure that it worked out that I've gone to the gym and put the song has whatever now that body is getting melting into the ground just like the phone melts into the ocean disappears powerful stuff and you know what it's a beautiful example of is that ability of of the wise person of the sage to take that bitter medicine that comes in life that the reversals the the blue trap
pleasantness of life and rather than necessarily work hard to counter it or to kill some sentimental little while ago and sentimental self-pity or or wallow in resentment or or other similar reactions
 he's embraced it
 as the in one sense The Bitter Sweet medicine
 you know because this feeling of isolation
 from the material
 quote on quote love
 is opening up the heart for the possibility of the spiritual love
 and it's kind of like you have to again you have to let go of one to embrace the other
and and he's saying he's quoting this worse and Baba timer Christian says you know what I do to those that are that are that are really turning to me you know what I do you know what Mercy I gave what special favor I show to those who who become very dear to me by there but by their sincere
 by their sincere desire to know me
 I just take it all the way if I don't give them
 all of this and you said I take all the stuff away until they're all alone and sitting there without anything all alone and and then and then they have nothing but me is that beautiful destitution where is in the material world destitution have to be destitute but the real yoga is found in the bottom of tongue
when there is this king or queen or when they have nothing else to turn to nothing else to lean into no other Comfort it seems like the material world has turned against them and then you just have Krishna you just reach up your hands of God that is like the dropa T calling out that's the highest connection you get right oh my Lord oh my Lord I have no one but you and then threw that you connect with everyone but you have to come there and I got to come through that gate if we're if we're leaning into our wealth or power or Glory just like Richard Kipling was saying
 expect that if you're sincere you might get things just shifted and taken away so you can really reach the Krishna and then you are right if you're leaning Lori if you're learning a leading into wealth of you expect that if you're sincere and that's why sometimes
people go through so reversal and they come to me I'm going to suffering through this part of me thinks they're making a lot of advancement they have this opportunity now to go real real deep real real it's just like yesterday and they were saying that you do sometimes they just won't go to astrologers will be just be like you're about to lose everything but sometimes and astrologer in a pepper it in a certain pallet of a wave I say instead of your ear astrological chart is going to lose everything they say this is a great time to go deep into your spiritual life really okay it sounds much more palatable it it's the most appropriate it's the most appropriate a good karma once again are good karma can ruin our life and
 suck that and if you're going through a
that destitution think thank you Christina I'm going to go deeper don't need it to anxiety or fear thank you for still probably says this is misery but it gives me a laugh I sit alone and laugh and we can we do have to kind of look at the comical nature of our endeavors in this world and when we see that they're foiled again and again and again we laugh at it we see how I got it now I'm the fool in this also kind of bring the United indicates in a sense important idea particularly within spiritual circles because even within our spiritual circles we still struggle with our material Vision in way of seeing people
 but sometimes we see someone going through it and
might feel oh look at them but you know like they're getting it now cuz you know they're not so Advanced there is a you know their material nature is punishing them while we're on the line to the chopping block of self is that for sure or even at perhaps they're the one that's more fortunate perhaps they're the one that's receiving the special blessing sure you know as a result not of they're not up there Monday and attachments but as a result of their sincerity that Christmas and let me be particular merciful to them interesting is a search it a flipped way to look at it isn't it
 do they flip a coin flip or things you don't know that you could be going very very deep in our spiritual life
