If you're at patreon the best time to move on over right it's like moving on up
 Reborns for trying to send messages out to everyone that if your Patron doing her that they were over here now and this is where you want to be yes okay man what's up what else is up ages is going to be in New York rathyatra this weekend meet us at the park bring for shot him cookies to distribute and then we'll have a key or two on that people can join in and we'll have our new
they just March in spring colors available a problem and I asked her a question or something like that I don't think I'm going to be at the ask him I'm going to be at our table the whole time I'm going to be in the parade so if you're in the parade that you prayed so I think 12 to 2 they say 11 but really starts around 12 and it starts up at what is that area called again and 45th Street and 5th Avenue Manhattan FAO Schwarz was or something now that's up at 59th Street this is about start at the beginning of Central Park but when the economy fell apart in 2008 and the city said no you got to start at 45th Street and these parades are shorter so we have a kind of understand what you want the economy back you were support jacking off there that's what you did to me did come back those 15 blocks back with him
 okay so we're going to start there and
you can just sort of like run along and find that parade if you come late or something but it ends up in Washington Square Park cuz dude was going to be there early he's not going to be in the parade I don't think he'll be at the table so if you want to wait down there I could distribute cookies hang out at our booth are both is going to be our wisdom of the ages book is going to be a hangout booth and if we all get there next year they'll give us more space to do more stuff so I highly recommend people to come to our booth sitting around hanging out with us singing songs are we singing and eating and dancing all day I'm good
 also we have can I make up a reminder meeting at noon in the women meet at 2 p.m. Easter parades are weird generally like I was
and they're weird this was a unique but they're weird I was in a marching band high school then you got it like that photo of you you posted with you holding a sousaphone I didn't know that was what a sousaphone was that's a sousaphone a tubas one that doesn't wrap around you but anyway it was a concert season the marching season
 August Eva but anyway it's regular like sometimes the one in the Thanksgiving Day Parade is you know that's the big one in New York City but the Jack and I brought the otra that's like a parade I can go yes this parade that's a parade I can get behind everyone who takes part it's not like you just sit there and watch it no you get involved you like or if you get in there when you pull the car
I tell you you have to pull each cart you have to go to each card has three cards for the 3 days of jogging up Bala Dave. Christian is older brother and then sue Barger Christmas history have to go to a beach cart and if you're really evolved you will bow down in the New York city streets and people might think of what are you doing with this guy doing are they crazy that's when you say I'm a loop to public opinion my life is for you my lord there's nothing better than bowing down to the New York city streets to allow to a large transcendental totem on a gigantic heart I have an idea right now
 I have an idea tell me some of the sages family
 community that. You know it's this tradition that people would sweep the the street in front of the parade as in front of the cards on our washer and like to that the whole parade
someone should be sweeping I was going to say just broom I love that I get a wisdom of the sages I guess get a room and put a bunch of stickers on it yeah and then one person and then the next second kind of like taking over for 10 minutes and cover the entire thing
 I love when people carry those protest signs but they're protesting jahjaga novel Sajak enough or something like that
 I'll just sign they look like a protest sign look like you're on strike you know but they actually say it but I think about that one but I need someone like you or someone to organize the room
 you bring the broom down you're taking the car anyway right
 bring on the Bro bring down all the kids I can barely keep my head on straight that the hell is what I'm going to bring a broom bring a broom but we need stickers all over that broom Orchard spray painted gold ore
have you seen her for him so I can I need to buy a new broom
 alright any volunteers on the chap would let us know if you want to bring the boys get my power washer will do much better job sweeping does nothing power washing the day before and just power like I can power wash the street in the morning you just power watch that street
 the Moon is the same and we're at where we do you know what we're doing on that horse was growing off buddy
 alright alright where are we at here's our nugget for today and its forehead or announcement that was that was it
 any sweet baby Christmas coming up
 I'm really I'm really under the weather you know the next time it should be on the platform the green to the
website now. Figured I had it I think they make it really easy it's super user-friendly more than just a website it's up to you know it's not just the website was going to say is that, that's just what the community culture this is your favorite musician and nine speaking of your favorite musician in mind if you see that super nice post Harley but up oh yeah I saw that reading my book that was so cool I feel so good because Harley was the first person that told me about Krishna and to see him reading the book it was like it struck a deep chord in my heart that has glasses on it sitting there perusing the pages
 yeah and he said he called me said listen one day me and my wife want to go to India and we want you to take us. That was very sweet
 I got to get him and you okay
after Harley here's my second favorite musician his name is George Harrison Living good friends with him maybe almost met him almost met him he was there in the January I left right at Christmas and he was there in January in 88 and 89
 each person has to find himself a wet each person has to find for himself a way for in a realization I still believe that's the only reason we're on this planet it's like going to school again each soul is potentially Divine and the goal is to manifest that divinity
 everything else is secondary that's good that's good he's sharp use insightful school it's like a reform school prison prison people don't like the idea of life or in prison we are in a prison
existence and you got to do time years it now that you have like you can't sit in prison and for the rest of your term blame the warden for what's going on in prison stupid Warden hate to be here it's not fair once we live in that worlds of complaining and blaming we we we lock ourselves in to the material world once we accept you know what I've done something wrong whatever I did I got it and now I'm going to move forward
 and I get out of the world to blame as soon as I start blaming as soon as I can start complaining I realize I'm in Maya
 as soon as I say start saying why me
 you know what I was practicing saying cuz I've been feeling horrible I'm just going to I'm just been sent you to serve it well I know I've been staying healthy or sick Krishna I am yours that's been my Mantra between my Java so yeah so if you never
learn the lesson that we got we got to do our own choices that we we live in a world of blame and you stay in the prison when it went when a criminal finally realizes they've done something wrong and they want to get better and they want to become appropriate citizens of this world then they get a early parole it's interesting it's almost like our prison
 if we say that we are in a prison prison wasn't the analogy that George Harrison use but I can see why you're going there it's like because you
 you don't get out until you're reformed right that's the really prison should work that way right it shouldn't be like your you go to jail for this many years is that your time if you're not performing never getting out yeah that would that would be a better system so like our print if if the prison is a law of karma right we're getting real
directions to past Deeds remaining in this world of karma rug we living in a virtual reality that is governed by the law of karma as long as we're operating under that system as long as we haven't as George Harrison the same here going inward developers in a realization and freed ourselves then we're stuck but it's it's almost like
 you know those people you know what I want to grab the damn, she's like a new box you go to diner the wee little jukebox they write yep I'm just as long as you keep feeding it you know it's kind of like we're in a jail where that the lock stays locked as long as you keep putting in a quarter and we keep putting him in the prison this is what we do in the material world would like to call this person is not so bad like what I get to work out with basketball games they feed us and therefore we never want to get out of the prison
like saying you can watch another television show in the prison if you put another quarter in okay I'll put another quarter in the end and so we're investing in our own bondage we're in Fayetteville that's a great line from bondage and
 we just got to stop putting those quarters in yeah but put in order to stop it what is putting in the corner is it it's chasing external Pleasures separate from connection to God the only way that we can the only way that we can break that addiction is we need to get addicted to something else we need to taste another type of pleasure and would George Harrison points was saying that's found in each person has to find for himself awaits for in a realization in her pleasure in her satisfaction and he saying that that's the whole reason why around this planet we turned away from that week we have to find it within and it's like he says it's like going to school again we are potentially Divine we have the potential to feel our own divinity
experience on DVD to find that pleasure and everything else is secondary that's not what life is about life is is about finding that instead of making a more comfortable prison more comfortable prison you and that's a good analogy and it was reading Baba Tom you know George Harrison
 it's good that inspiration we did a while back for the title was but don't put don't put linen sheets on your prison caught a grown up to that without me that I think there's one that shows I wasn't there cuz I give all the title so I'm taking the credit for that account I'm trying to put some crown molding up in my prison cell is the material world this is a joke that's pretty good
that's what the whole deal with higher taste is once you get the higher taste you on
 it's something more than that sits almost like you get a it's like the first time of the higher taste that we get when practicing bhakti and there's a wow there's something better that's like the first time you get a cell with the window and you're like wow there's a whole nother world out there where they're running it for you outside so the first time you've been to that kirtan if something touches you just start to cry and I cared on for the first time you taste a shot given by a devotee right to vote he just put your arm around you and gives you some transcendental knowledge or some love or listens to you that first time that we get a higher taste that's a glimpse Glimpse outside the window and nothing in that cell
 can make sense anymore nothing will seem like what was I thinking
 why was I try to make myself comfortable here there's something so much more than this is serious infection brother is a serious infection cuz once you get that bug your life
I'm looking at all these people on Zoom today your life is ruined I'm sorry that's all I got to say and I wrote it never be peacefully with your old world because you know there's something so much more a lot of people just like happy in the South but I guess pretty good I'm going here this year you're going to do this here this year going to do that what's the what's the bug of agita maybe little Corona gnosis versus ask her what's the higher taste first. Corona unmute this young lady here we are 10 year olds doing it from Lebanon Corona unmute yourself
 at the time I don't know the verse you know the verse
 I just need the first line of the
 is Shia vannevar tante
 play Ivan B Anthony.
that's good enough crew and I couldn't understand we're all sitting here impressed everyone else is like rubber bands like what the hell did she have any Vartan t r i c e Dana City English Premier the embodied so that means hours may be restricted from sets enjoyment like I'm trying to control myself like a yogi write the taste for exotic Still Remains such engagements this is the body and ride bikes. Sing a high or taste and otherwise I'm not just trying to like things go I'm actually grabbing onto something new but it's in her and its spiritual but seizing such engagement engagement
experiencing a higher taste they are fixed in Consciousness that's the way that's the way so powerful that's what happens at a higher taste and nothing seems the same as Rodger that's right the Ultra Dance
 sing Party first Rafi otra was so good Prabhu
 first one my first one that was just hearing and chanting all day long and I remember being in Washington Square Park and one of my teachers came up to me and said I said I love it
 daddy said he will get better and better and better when you here and chat all day long you're not in the body anymore you feel like for this sorority Ultra Festival
 the Temptation is because you see brings together thousands of buck to Yogi's from all over the place people you haven't seen it
and then you get in that parade and this is the most esoteric aspect of our entire theology that Krishna is being dragged back to Randolph and by the gopis so that they can relate to him not as a king up on the Chariot as he's as he's related to Angelica but that they can love him as the intimate voice over in The Hobbit right and so it's it's a beautiful incredibly Rich ritual
 but the problem is The Temptations just to start Jibber jabbering with people that you haven't seen in a long time as you're going to yeah keep it high keep it high sing the entire time some people but but sing the entire time that'll keep the keep chatting is going on stay in that cure time don't break out of that kirtan the whole way and you will have your higher level of spiritual get that higher taste but then I'm going to challenge everybody
challenging because you're going to get down there going to feel good everything's going be nice you're going to be in the park is going to be all these Krishna Booth set up this weekend if you're going on you're eating prashad crew will be there all your buddies when you're like this is a great day and you're going to stop giving the credit trust me on this one you going to stop giving the credit to Krishna and you're going to see like what a nice day in the park what a nice day Washington Square Park is so nice I got to come back here and guess what's going to happen you walk outside that Circle and you feel what the motive ignorance and what more passion ignorance is immediately once that part close up or you walk outside that Circle New York again you've lost protection and you're going to realize it's not the park it's actually the holy name of the devotees keep it in there for you got to keep that inside with you at all the time then you're ready to go it's true it's true
 so yeah chant the whole way.
dance the entire way down from 45th Street down to Washington Square Park then when you get into that Park yeah go ahead get a little something to eat this but come over to our booth and we're just going to keep the Channing going downtown to Lorde jogging up in the street I don't care what your way that's ever down in the street that Aunt like Embrace people you know tell them Haribo happy to see you and back to singing There's it there three carts maybe we'll pull one of the carts tell me is it would this be the card for the Divine messenger of Love Guru but there are three cards 14 Krishna Lord jagannath 14 then the next one is subhadra his sister

 let's dive into the share my body with somebody say let's do it
 okay even though he sick
 Krishna president
 my mind is your short
circuiting in the deepest Krista conscience way
 ready to start to get just a little bit senile just a little bit I can feel it coming on I'm serious what what he he gets like 80 he's going to be like one of these absent-minded sautters it's just like totally Krishna conscious but not told me and I would have been trying to like I would be really all what I got like less energy and I'm really trying to keep him in line you know it's going to be challenging
 Bobby more detached then to I'll be like yeah thank you come you're going to be old man very soon to be old man and then just one of the worst that could happen to both of us could die I miss you and I guess you'll be protected by Lord Shiva does protect me in a regular okay let's continue with this Ryan I'm the most
some witches are very mean to Conquest when should I expect my base and sees to the Supreme Lord Ryan huntsinger and reach you this trip most human being at some other saraswoti the goddess of learning and to be honest today if the author most upright locate back to you about the night sticky but regular tense of class in the Box Tom and by rendering service a devotees all that is troublesome the heart we can eradicate it and loving service to the Supreme Lord who is praised transcendental songs will be established as a reputable fact again at the madejski again I was born in the darkness of ignorance but my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch light of knowledge base and see if I can load a speed big torch reading for the bog of time
Windows 7 chapter 10 text 27 it's it's 27 so we also now what's happening is Lord Brahma
 is speaking to Lord Vishnu in the form of learning today
 s27 the demon
 Iranian cashew Pooh I'm just thinking about demons the demon around the cashew Pooh received from me the benediction that he would not be killed by any living being within my creation this is bro my speaking he gave him that benediction with this insurance and with the strength to ride from austerities in Mystic power he became excessively proud and transgressed all the beta conjunctions it's more like you got a gift and then you use it against the very people that
the gift just so wrong and we should look at that in our own lives do we have gifts do you have a gift there's a lot of people here with gifts and you know what they are and sometimes you're hiding your gift but you have a gift they're not meant to be used for your ego and then some people do another weird ego thing with their gift is they hide it they say my gift is important whenever I use my gift I get in my ego you got to use your gift don't bury your gift in the closet in a shoebox under a coat you use your gift to serve Lord Krishna you give your Shakti back to the Lord you reconnect your talent with God and that's the Perfection of the gift I'm talking to sell you out there you know who you are
 okay okay
and when you do that you'll feel great
 and I'm looking Lori pad right now who's in Italy chilling around Paradise but you know she's a very very talented yoga teacher and and you know and she's charismatic and people love her classes and she packed all the classes and because of that she doesn't use it for real though she used it to get back to the people and that and that is like the Perfection of being a yoga teacher because there's a lot of yoga teachers I mean you want to see some Eagle trips hang out with you you can go out to the Wall Street to find the width with Grace and style and she just offered to back to Christmas trees at Ash and she's in love with Krishna is quite beautiful to see someone engaged in there and we got time so he's taking all his
he's creative he's artistic he's a filmmaker and he's making this something Divine movie which is which shows people going through their transformation who's at the film about what about me and then I'm kind of a bunch of other people about a bunch of other people that I do
 good stuff using your gift and Christmas service is quite wonderful thank you
 okay honey I text 28 by great Fortune her any country whose son prolonged Mirage has now been released from Death Or although he is a child he's an exalted TT now he is fully under the protection of your Lotus feet
you know what I got I got to give another example here of a box of Duty who's with me right now box of Duty and one says he's actually a very talented filmmaker also and but he just feels like he wants to dive into his body so you'll do is tell me again what's at 2323 and County I said this time set aside a little spiritual Foundation my life he wants to serve and so sometimes in our service in our surrender we say you know what even though I'm very good at this I'm just going to do whatever Krishna wants right now and he's just really like he's doing menial service Services whole life know eventually things will level out
 I was a barometer I for two years doing menial service and then it became manifest again
that you know I think I meant to do music again but but for Krishna this time so all your natural gift will come back into but sometimes Christian wants to see some booty sometimes Krishna just wants to see if you'll just do anything for him and that's very that's that's very beautiful what's the craziest thing you've ever had to do for Krishna
 craziest thing hang out with you just you get books in the parking lot and walk around with Rob Roy in a Connecticut parking lot when it's freezing out eating bananas for lunch and walk up to people leaving the mall and say why you're interested in yoga meditation and I just like it when guys ever want I just left me in the I just wait a second you're a capital aren't you and I was like this is weird I such a massive ego
 oh my God
I was pretty crazy how about the time you and me take a bucket shower behind a Walmart at 4 in the morning as we're driving across the country and I was shivering cuz it was freezing out I'm wearing nothing but a Indian towel Affinity until you've already paid you already getting dressed I'm pouring the water over my head shivering and that 100 spot lights go on and it stops with the guns draw drawn I think you that we are robbing a Walmart I was pretty special to take a shower it's 4 in the morning I could have a shower later when the sun came up but it was like no cuz she was like take a shower it's shower time yeah it was
 but I guess would be more found out at 9 if we were taking about the shower but you're more of our suspect I would look really weird nine people are shopping. We met I probably do
like right in front of the place I should have asked a question but can I ask you what's a crazy if you think you've done for Lord Krishna I don't know I'd have to think about that I've done to that program around rodica and she just kind of crazy that's crazy up and down really dirty but contact prayer
 I'm running by monkeys okay if this point okay cuz there's a squirrel when you die it is bring it back okay but you were saying whatever you do you make an offering that spoke of Akita right
 Kuroshio Sushi at your house she did not say yet yet to cut Caruso Caruso Met Opera.
come to me whatever you do whatever you eat wherever you go on vacation whatever I say or do to perform whatever austerities you perform what does that as a giveaway what a great verse to me do you know if if yesterday was where your merch Monday
 yes and little Carly Brown she posted a picture of her wearing her merch going to get out I want to get on this bandwagon to wear your March Monday to post it and so if you get the Ramones style wisdom of the sages shirt it's got like that presidential seal on it oh yeah and in the presidential seal the eagle is holding in one Talent is holding arrows and the other is holding a like an olive branch in the real seal in the rear seal in the Ramones one he's got like a baseball bat new overlay
well they were actually but and then I think it's in the mouth of the bird know I'm on point he wrote in the mouth of the bird is a like a banner
 and what is it e pluribus unum I think it says what does it say on the Ramones when it says Hey Ho Let's Go on ours
 it says touch purusham a tarp and I'll do that as an offering to help desk it is a Boggle timer 1 Town Isabel is it offensive to hold it in his talents with his feet while that's how he does have a wing that's one of his arm that isn't offering to me that's the theme in the keys right is not telling you not to do things do it as an offering to be okay this is good stuff
 migrate
Fortune veronique a shih-poo son prolonged Maharaj has now been released from Death Or although he is a child he's an exalted devotee now he is fully under the protection of your Lotus feet happens all the time where someone should be dead and there are live ever hear the story about the baby bounced out of a car and it's one of those things I follow on Instagram hashtag close calls it's like it's like compilations of things like how is this person not dead like a guy like in India going right to the trainers bicycle jumps off a train that runs over his bicycle clothes it's like they should be dead but there's some Divine protection going on
 so this was actually Lord this in some cases it's just good karma perhaps it's a demigod perhaps it's good luck in this case it's the Lord Lord Vishnu Taken full control of the situation it's not time for you you have a bigger
got involved directly directly got involved as a map of the next verse is going to speak to this and by the way sometimes the Divine Laura can get get involved in taking you from this world you know what I mean because you leaving this world let's just take us to Uber
 like today he was giving us so much we were like Calves suckling on his knowledge is wisdom
 but but my point is why but we saw that when I end your left eye under the great tear Taniya
 when he left you and I were devastated he was like foundational to our bhakti and we couldn't understand why Christian would take this Soul he's still relatively young he's done so much he is so much potency
but what happened when he left this world instead of the 24 hour kirtan Amber Govan dissolving it back up more powerful people start flying in from all over the world to take part of it people became very attached to the Holy Name people started to really honor him and ADI play and appreciate his offering I felt like a bandit bolstered the holy name and the power of chanting the holy name is Charles Oakley Rob Roy and the whole New York Yankee or Time party and all those people were bolstered by his leaving this world so so it's driving a person higher even though it appears like he's gone I'm saying is if his his service expanded a service expanded
 there's no loss there's only gain when great Souls leave this world or if they stick around in this world either way you stick around to steal but I'm happy you go
call sad but it's going to only get bigger we're going to everyone's going to everyone's got a joint Patriot and listen to your course not patient patient anymore right around the new platform the wisdom of the ages. Our new platform okay give a little back huh you feel back this is important verse hear text if one meditate upon your Transit Dental body
 you naturally protect him from all sources of fear even in imminent danger of death isn't it true once we become Krishna conscious things that The Fever of anxiety diminish you suffering from anxiety
 embrace the Supreme Lord chant the holy
read the bottom of Tom you're the fever of your anxiety of your fear of your worry will diminish you see this and not just devotees of Krishna you see this and devout Christians they just become Fearless like I'm not worried about these things I was worrying about I trust God has a plan for me
 I just said I'm looking for me to try to micromanage our health and well-being and future it's it's our Karma read the commentary on this is just short one paragraph commentary I want to hear this from you check this out everyone is sure to Die song right it was good that I remember reading that I was like who are these guys at the most negative he's going to die or no one is excused from the hands of death not in this prison or not right
I am just kidding but that's how you feel you feel like yeah everyone is booked but I'm not
 which is but a feature
 death it's a feature of the personality of God had with you sorry I had asked him that when one becomes a devotee however he is not destined to die according to a limited duration of life
 everyone has a limited duration of life for the devotees lifetime can be extended by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that's interesting who who is able to nullify the results of one's Karma very interesting you might have the karma to live a short life and Christian says that for you you might have to, not have no money and Krista could let you know what you need money cuz you're going to do good things with me or you might have a comment of famous wealthy and Krista could say you know what your karma was to be famous and Wealthy but that's going to ruin your spiritual life and we've seen people
who who got Fame who got money who got a popularity and act lays but sometimes it kills the spiritual life let it be known for everybody out there
 make your prayer be I want to do my service for you Krishna but please protect me from the Maya of Fame of Fortune of a wrinkle free life because I can get very self-absorbed when things get weird things start going well you know where I'm going to want that you're going to like this I think I want to open up this esoteric mystical literature call the samudra shastra
 Erica is all about palmistry
 oh yeah and they're it described that there's certain lines at a certain place every hand that indicate how many children you'll have yep right here outside of your hands yeah that's right
and very good you know that I know a little bit about everything but it but it also has left a little cabinet with that information
 tell Dad that they're there you can find like how many children you're destined to have were you tested up kids do to your karma
 but
 it says that can change through Guru nishta to burn dedication to service to the guru were you testing up kids
 according to my palm
 I think I got two right there there's a little kasuba in the in the in the universe floating around
 stop serving
 little baby costume spinning around outer space with little angel wings anyway let's try to stay focused on the point here is that what's the point
you were saying you were saying is your dedication on Guru eliminated your children and what I'm trying to say it and it just
 button your lip for a second here cuz I can tell he just dying to not allow me to make this point the point is like let's go back to the beginning let's go back to George Harrison
 and he was saying he didn't use the word prison but we kind of interpreted that way right that were in here and we have to learn a lesson we have to be reformed we have to come in touch with the inner spiritual realization he said he said school I was thinking reform school that I went to Portugal and then you could go that way short and end so so another words here is a paradigm that this life is that this world is designed in such a way where we keep coming back again and again until we learn the lessons that were meant to learn and so we're on the cyclic kind of karmic wheel because we keep putting coins into the thing because you want to try to enjoy the things of this world and it's
oh now you okay you can enjoy the now you're going to get more karma now you're going to get results to that activity you come back in another body yeah he haven't learned the lessons yet but this idea is a devotional service is so powerful because it is kind of like you're going right to the warden and you're clearly demonstrating
