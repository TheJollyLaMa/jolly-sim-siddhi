Com register also we have our back to your group meetings today at 1 and 9:30 p.m. eastern time here at the a super-soldier Tuscany Consciousness this morning you know what I was remembering is figure out the difference between a stromboli and a calzone
 I was just thinking you know spend mornings are so nice there cuz there's that kind of
 are you calling a patio or something to bed that big are you off that comes off as that one you know room where we have all our get-togethers and you can sit there and watch the sun rise above the hills of Tuscany Italy
Scenic perfect and believable it's like the most breathtaking thing like the nicest thing we've ever seen is some mcmansion on the Hudson River or something like that but yeah just like a massive Palace I heard that you enough and there's happens to be a prize I'm talking I know but it's a bandage point and all these people built with this type of vastu oh yeah that's right in like we're going to set up here and it's going to overlook that it's going to face this direction I am very cool I think this year I'm going to just chant there every morning as the sun rises in invite other people to come in we'll make it like a real serious Joppa session you know you're going to selectively invite people selectively start a little team
that's how the mind works so it is so slow
 actually that's going to be kind of like part of this but we talked about today how we how we think other people are enemies when it's just like it's really just in the mind you know it's often times the more I think about it it's like no one's even thinking about you which is worse but I'm before I move any further let's bring on our our good friend Joshua Tree l o g i c e welcome back to the show how are you creates these are incredible, which you know how to see and wear around their neck and they hold sacred sometimes you put Sacred dust from the holy places sometimes people put her down hill going to bust from from Dobbin sometimes Montrose are

 and even David and I and I wore Randolph and dust for years and I would always get compliments and I started
acting amulets from all different spiritual traditions for like 35 years in about 6 years ago I asked about people dying Mirage for His blessings and I just started creating heirloom quality casted amulets and the most beautiful part about the whole thing is that in the west non devotees their their desire to have one is to put loved one's ashes and now that I had become a widow and I'm on this journey of grief and understanding that relationship it opens up every conversation I have with somebody it starts with Krishna Consciousness devoting on devotee and it's just dovetailed my spiritual life into this
 passionate I have about creating, so how did you learn how to make them so nice in a 3D rendering program and then each kovacek

 yep a blue hairy ball
 Joshua Taylor nice to talk to Joshua again last time I talked to her saying something like drove courses around we forget about it and you were like you wouldn't even look at me cuz there's an art to the squirrel squirrel even if even if the squirrel Strays from the topic ultimately it has to enhance the topic but if you just push the squirrel too far
 is it destroys everything that's squirrel sometimes goes to like the frozen screen
because you feed off of the tension like if I say hey stop that that just makes you more excited and so that's like pouring gasoline on a fire to put it out so I've learned I just have to withdraw it's not like you have to cut off the air to it it's like it's like what he does when I speak of something mundane he gives me that look like
 and look so no response didn't know you blew it all right listen I've got a nugget for it but first of all I want to say I feel better today was really sick yesterday miraculously I think the show cured me no doubt no doubt I would remember before the show before we got on Zoom I was telling these young people is like I'm really out of it I'm going to fetal position over this position on the couch
 and then we did that shall we talk about Jack and I feel like I transcended my body bar jug of entering my heart
something happened so it was like a like you're the jagadguru now you know what you know what let me share something with the everybody in the audience today and I think this is very very important I didn't our universe was on a slippery slope last night I went to Facebook Marketplace and weltner Facebook Marketplace a great place to get to get stuff that you need no not like Facebook Marketplace
 it's like a it's like a Craigslist without murderers you know I'm sure they're accurate face okay
 anyway enough getting sucked into
 I'm over Facebook in general
I happened to go on to some vaishnava I want to check Facebook messages I never check on Facebook and all of a sudden I'm looking at you know devotees that I'm friends with posting things and people just getting into disgruntled arguments that I sent the volume like don't you guys understand don't you guys listen to his messages but you can't criticize the bodies of the worst thing you could do if your spiritual life even if you don't you guys understand like things don't happen to you that happen for you I can't believe you're sitting in a pool of bitterness like 20 years bitter about this guy walked away with nothing from Krishna consciousness
lecture
 so fascinating about to be on my Rush this genius genius Russian is one of these super cheap there like they've got intelligence and they know everything about everything how did you learn all this very wonderful having a very good advice and he's building up he's building an obstacle Paradise it go over downhill his it's like I never the Russian people like people speaking and I have to go back and listen cuz there's a scientific name but he was but he was using like Western science and combining it with Eastern
teachings but he was saying that
 he was asked what it was all about emotions and and
 and using the Western analysis of what's happening in the body with emotions oh and transmission time That Into You know the book the understanding of what would like embody the ideas that it's a drug that when you chant Chris's name
 if you're in the healthy state of awareness you begin to cry but your heart is so soft just Chris's name is so sweet and attractive they wouldn't think of Krishna
 you just eat if you choke up in tears pour from your eyes that's where we want to get with that's what we're in a healthy spot that means that means you're capable of relishing the deepest emotions of love that's how powerful the name is but we have to have clear consciousness
your conscience be your heart now I'm balling right now. I was doing my ass and I wasn't fully concentrated I got to go back I got to hear it again but he was saying that if you take negative just going at that spiritual emotion but if you take it to sound the level of material in motion to studies show that you know that like when you feel positive emotions happiness gratitude Etc side of your body kind of expands and there's an opening that there's actually you know we may say like open up your heart but actually the heart does open and when you get these negative emotions of anxiety or fear or anger
 yeah you you kind of shrink up and you tighten up I mean you feel it so it comes up to getting someone comes up to give you a big hug hey how are you doing I really miss you
say something horrible your really comment on your book tighten up you shrink you go to Amazon read a comment in your book that's not positive if I had that happened actually it hasn't yet no one think about doing it so so so when we get the divorce he is very conscious that I want this hard opening vibrations moving through my body he was saying that we can't just artificially begin to feel these emotions he's deep spiritual emotions but we can work on
 the kind of in between the material in motion negative emotions in the full on spiritual positive motion is the is the the emotion of gratitude the attitude of gratitude that's something that we can we can focus on and that attitude of gratitude is going to kind of open us up we really need to be at so when you if you're about to you
can you try to light the fire of what in your heart so that your heart melts when you get in when you get on Facebook and start writing that crap even though you think you're right you really think you're defending the sumber Daya you're all that stuff you're just pouring water right on that fire and and you just you're just damaging your own yeah possibility you know of of becoming a soft-hearted vaishnava that that's the goal of about 5 comments and I felt like I need to take a shower I get the baby if I don't feel like reading that I would jump in your pond over there I'm serious never read a fence of things never let them into your Consciousness especially if you have no control of what you can do about it in a certain way you stick your head in the sand but we always want a police everything like we have some bike week and it's the same way I feel about crime
stuff like that there's some people there like crime detectives murder detectives that they did they solve like horrible murders and that's their job and they got to look into the murderers and Psychopaths and things like that but deep into it they got to get deep into it to figure these things out I don't have to do that that's not my job therefore I need not study the lives of Charles Manson all these people like love to read books about serial killer that's like the worst children that kill my God you don't need to put that in your mind. Let's leave
 we already have problems sleeping at night at re people are asking for a link to that I want to find it I'm going to try to find it hopefully I still got it. About to begin
yeah I think if you go to YouTube and yet your Google body began goswami and emotions you probably got it I think it's called don't be nice you such a beautiful refined gentleman there their they're all like that you're like your battery level of human species and then we know the answer is yes
 okay
 I'm starting to sympathize with you and remember the old days when I used to just give me cuz you're used to share room in India and he'd be like white he has a whole costume that has a whole going to bed when I do not
Dodge myself look like I'm under my nose wine down and then once he's ready laying in the bed I would burst in the door just go
 and I'd wake him completely up he'd be up again not good I lay on my bed and fell asleep immediately I guess what there's a there's a new bodies like I got like two things going on I got my body is like it is time to go to bed right now and then I've got my mind go yeah let's go to bed right now and I'll lay down in the bed in the my mind's like let's think about fearful thing in the universe that can happen to you and the people that you love ever have that like as soon as you lay down your body's like no I'm out in the mind is going I'm going to think about what are some breaks in the house how you would have our country
what about zombies what about aliens invading goes on and on and on what's going on in my mind when I'm trying to sleep if something like that cuz I can't swim
 you don't think about people breaking into your house not at all
 last thing on my mind like a regular one for me that before I go to sleep I like lock the door then I go I'm sorry that was a squirrel
 a big one Sean Sean agree she says I go to bed every night wondering but okay thank you thank you for that validation oh man we have a nugget still yeah I think this is
let's hear what you do let's wrap this nugget into the show it's going to wrap it after hit the nuggets
 overrated and I'll get right into the show
 is from the Reverend. Bye. Bye you think you're blocking Doctor Martin Luther King and that's the kind of thing they can someone canceled it. I've been canceled and I bounce back today from dr. Martin Luther King jr. Was he a look at that and put it on the board what's that what kind of doctor was he had a PhD probably in like what kind of doctor you it wasn't like a surge yet I please
 no he works out of search the name they should give doctors who work on your off the browser
can I be a ribbon if I freed spiritual things everyday
 people have to Revere you interesting if you want to be real maybe it just means the reverential
 well that is that your revered know that the Reverend I think the squirrel let's read the Nugget
 I'm Luther King Pursuit
 studies in Systematic Theology Boston University's graduate school are you willing to do that now I'm not okay then you're not a reverend sir you're not a doctor either look up what makes a REV and Reverend you want to be both a doctor and a reference I don't want to be a doctor I'm saying that doctors
 should be able to heal a person if they're sick this different
the doctors I know what they've done a doctorate in order to love your enemies you must begin by analyzing your think about that counterintuitive again
 is it not
 yeah are you thinking about it are you thinking about it I know because like Francis let's say someone
 gets here's the message we should really learn to love our enemies and we think all that yeah yeah that sounds right then our first inclination maybe let me look in them
 to try to understand why they should be loved. Like do you know okay I'm seeing a lot of the issues with my enemies is there something there that's lovable
 and you know it not that there's anything wrong with that but I think the Doctor Martin Luther King's message here's a bit
found it really has something to do with finding something in myself
 finding my own nature when I realized something about my own nature
 I'm going to realize something about the nature of everyone well it's my three jerks and had a theory like if it's 10 in the morning and meet some guy was a jerk just like oh my God I can't believe the universe sent this guy to be a jerk to me like one another jerk would like some guy comes in total jerk or give me another jerk if you're meeting three jerks in a day you might hear this year you're the jerk so it's one of these things like that to the degree it says more about me
 when I start it says more about me if I'm finding fault in people when I hear someone come up to me and they're just complaining about somebody I don't listen to the person that complaining about I offer up a list of like what's up with this guy that he can't deal with this person in a healthy way you can't that is
his mind he's carrying it with him and we do this a lot
 in the course of a day we do this a lot with people in general but we do this a lot with people from the past and the question arises like how much can I let my past influence my future and it's a huge thing for this whole practice that we're going through that this releasing of resentment and not carrying it around in the heart since they were talking about it's going to be free of your you're going to you're going to close up that was a Christmas miracle that I brought that up on Facebook today it's exactly what you're talkin about we we sure have a lot but I brought it up because you've brought it up so you brought up the iris randomly but we're like this you were saying this ties into everything that we're doing leptin remember okay weather. OK Google, will we let
part of the past heard our future we have to just choose or then he died that is over I find it very fascinating when it happens to people who are devotees to and because they all have a story not all of them obviously you're not every devotee I don't feel that way but everybody's got a story about pasta past heard about half mistreatment a pass dysfunction perhaps a crazy Joe d'avola out there irrational even if we can't assimilate it into how this is going to help me grow
 therefore I put it in my category of spite revenge and resentment and Matt is just pushing the disease down into the body more and more and more and it's not going to help me and we can't grow and it's going to be a low-ceiling to our
spiritual Evolution with all of us work new to bhakti or people in practice somebody for 40 years we got up and you see it these are like the ABCs of spiritual life we never get over this stuff A lot of times devotees thing to become involved in spiritual life you have to talk about so many esoteric topics first of all these very basic topics of freeing yourself a resentment and anger and holding on to something from the past and if you don't deal with that stuff
 think about your evolved ideas of how I hear about it you sound like you resent them right now
 that's good now thank you for delivering that you want to cry you can't do that if you hate your father you're all shriveled up
right you can't do that if you're holding onto anger of in the workplace you can't do it sit there's two there's two categories of people you get angry at and what is I'm day to day basis those ones very quickly got to practice you feel something you got to let it go immediately. Immediately and the older ones which are almost like trees that have been in the ground for a while saplings that grow up Dylan grow too much you can't weed them out so you got to go back and you got to do some serious work to get over old resentments and After Twenty Years of telling the same story of your hurt cuz that's what we do we endorse our story of how we are hurt we want the whole world to know it's sort of like stroke us you're okay it's going to be okay and what that does is it makes our pain story are
 are trimester it it it makes it into concrete and that takes a lot to melt that and 20
and forgiveness and this is all happening for my Evolution and God is not trying to strike you down of the universe is not against you and and this is the only way even in Western therapy they say you got to forgive you got a free got to learn to forget thank you thank you I forgive you for what you forgive me
 and I just want you to know I forgive you pick your butt
 okay brother let's get into bhagat on now cuz this is all going to tell you
it's hard for me to talk to Ryan and the musketeer Rancho Bernardo to Mom gave us some I told you I'm in the area before I start to see my bag of time witches are very means of Conquest what should I bring Spackle a base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan on tuner and Ryan Ritchie the soup most human being and two other saraswathi the goddess of learning it's just really off today the author not stop her about race Unity talk to you about the regular attendance and class is all that is troublesome to Hart become eradicated

 I was born in the darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer obeisance he's at their Lotus feet these arks
actions of gratitude meditations and it's all gratitude they're not just opened your funk tree yeah it's not just like sappy New Age stuff to say you know the heart opens

 my heart chakra opens for you cuz I'm so now we hear Boggstown what's up you can't rush through those brother you got to keep us this is your duty right now cuz you chances want to like reading I can leave that silly traumatic but but like a a mindful yes I can I do it everyday you're just not listening I forget I forgive you with more speed in through those four
236 episode forgive you alright let's hear what what's going on forgiveness arrogance isn't it it's another way of being right at what is it called passive aggressive
 all right let's let's hear what Lord Vermont agrees with you about something I take it personally do you do cuz yeah I was like oh yeah you do realize how often it happens okay you silly tie let's bring it to the bar with Tom that's what I'm trying to say
 okay, Tom Canto 7 chapter 10 text 30 okay this is Lord for my speaking right now
freaking he speaking to Vermont
 wouldn't you love to just be a fly on the wall while Lohr Distributing talked to Brock will they just said he was shining right like his face is so bright you can't even see him
 I would love to see him would love to see him
 Crystal gives you what you want
 my dear Lord Vermont oh great Lord from the lotus flower I cuz he grew or no for the lotus flower from the belly button who can make this up from the belly button of Lord Vishnu my dear Lord, O great Lord born of the lotus flower just at as it is dangerous to feed milk to a snake right cuz that makes a poisonous snake healthy they say if he made venomous right as it's dangerous to feed milk to a snake is a common analogy so it is dangerous to give benedictions
to Demons feel like another animal might actually become the peas and become like tamed through your feeding at but the snake know who are who are by Nature ferocious and jealous did all the demons here by Nature I warned you not to give such benedictions to any demon again they're Naughty by Nature just are Naughty by Nature I met Naughty by Nature did I tell you that
 yeah tracks there's a picture of me and Treach from Naughty by Nature
 okay yeah you to put in the book Google image search if you can find Ray cappo and Treach from Naughty by Nature should be up there somewhere okay okay I also get salt and pepper
very nice we got to keep this for now we're going to go from Sage level 42 Sage level 3 hiragana okay no one knows what that means but sure Naruto Moody continue if he's the narrator you could do it to remember when this all started
 it was chapter one of the seven Canto where are you just here is saying it seems like like the Lord is
 partial
 and that's how the story that you know there's the whole thing about ship all merging into the body and in all that and then what about the story with pearl odd and hiranyakashipu and we heard the whole thing so now Nardo's now we're back to nardis speaking to can you texture
 Dirty Money continue Del can you to steer
 the Supreme personality of godhead who is not visible to an ordinary human being spoken this way instructing Lord Vermont then being
the Lord disappeared from that place he's not he's not visible to earn a living being
 although people say well if I don't believe if I don't see him I won't believe yeah well you become extraordinary then you can see him that he can be visible he can show himself as we read in these stories its extraordinary people that become that makes sense if I want to go to like the White House and I want to go to the if I want to have breakfast with whoever the standing president but there's some leader because I have to become extraordinary to get that invitation I agree 100% with her the same but I sense a little resentment in your tone just a little that's not true that you think you think I'm resentful that they won't have me for breakfast
 by the way I taught yoga on the White House lawn
I didn't get inside did you know but I waved to him
 alright okay
 glamorous been worshipped and offered prayers to all the demigod such as ra ma Shiva and the properties who are all parts of the Lord the progenitor has they all are part of his Universal body and it said I love this concept of progenitor cells and I know you do but let's start talking about giraffes and all this just meet you there after how long was shukracharya and the other great Saints you know I have a problem understanding a supercharger you let go of that resentment, understanding he's like a great St said cuz right now it says along with supercharger and other great Saints to supercharger is the guru
 of the Demons
 I'm trying to think is he a demon
well maybe they will it cause problems and other great Saints it sounds like he is one of the great science and I suppose on one level he is what does he say. I said it really says Muniz maybe you are finished Professor knows the answer to that
 does dementia says kavya at HEB for supercharger you want to unmute him he's husband see if he knows anything about Greg lapatka who radio pod we have a weather radar this yesterday he was doing his Austin and had no shirt on when we pull them again until he's a professor we look the same in the Charlie Daniels Band going to say you don't look the same well
 okay anyway he's the kind of person if you took like a hundred random people and put him in the mix and see
he's the professor is right here okay okay with the way he's going to Be Our Guest on Saturday interview on what is a Gruen go device invisible to talk about that really okay Groupon what do you know anything about shukracharya
 no no CD thank you we're looking forward to seeing you Saturday you know what I think I have more respect for people who say I don't know
it's okay to ask a person for directions and they don't know the direction that are still trying to give you directions some places are like that like in India they don't want to disappoint you so they just tell you something they think is worse to not tell you anything now it's worse to tell you the wrong information I so much respect he was like nope don't know thank you all right you know what we're going to listen to that as we drive down to New York City okay is your doing the interview right I yes that's right
 now we're not going to get to the main verse if you don't move along here right now maybe I'll save it for tomorrow and that's it that's it we can read but maybe don't get there today but it's about time the airport along with supercharger another great Saints lorber ma whose seat is on the lotus flower made prologue the king of all the demons and Giants
 TV Universe by Justice
giant sometimes Donovan on the dawn of us with the tight pants Giants are real
 and that's a whole interesting study the study of giants
 OK Google Sierra Mesquite Giants now you know now I got some backing of the study when they discovered okay meet us there after all the demigods had to buy lorber ma probably worship by prolonged Mirage
 how interesting the demigods were worshipped that's what the last verse just said he'll probably worship I put a lot they offered their utmost benedictions and then return to the respective abodes Oprah Lodge worshipping them and they worship him back you know this verse recognize this text 35
 yes I will call it a big one okay got a mess
big message not ready
 that's the two Associates of Lord Vishnu the sons of DeeDee she's the mother of the Demons were both killed by illusion they had thought that the Supreme Lord who is situated in everyone's heart
 was their enemy
 so this is giant BJ they both died that they sorta like zooming out a little bit of each other they were cursed to take birth as demons they became hiranyaksha and her any cuz you poop and now we had one that was already killed at him this story hiranyakashipu was killed this they both been killed by Lord Vishnu because they thought that God was never anyone's heart was actually their enemy that's the big illusion that we have enemies in this world mostly we have so much in common coming out
greatest enemy huh you know it was two chapters back that provide deliver this verse which was just such an important one do you remember the struggle and hey this is an easy way to remember this verse 7 8 9 chapter 7 chapter 79 right now okay my dear Father prayer. Speak into the running car shampoo my dear father please give up your demoniac mentality Let It Go Do not discriminate in your heart between enemies and friends
 make your mind equipoise towards everyone
 except for the uncontrolled and misguided mind there is no enemy within this world
 when one sees everyone on this platform of equality
 one then comes to the position of worshiping the Lord perfectly
that's 79 all these problems all these problems with people in the world all this
 it's just going on here my mind
 right that's something that I have control I can't control all these people
 but I can learn to control my mind
 and that's where the focus in when you act and then like as Martin Luther King was going to say you know in order to love your enemies you must begin by analyzing yourself go within look on hook it would look at the patterns in the loops in your own mind deal with those and then you're going to realize I don't have an enemy right that this this entire universe is actually working for my progress in spiritual life let me relate to every living being like that even if they're hostile as a very Broad
gate to understanding Spiritual Authority you know I brought a wide gate is everybody's going to spiritual path and we have to be also careful even with into nothing Dharma that we come Fanatics as well
 no cuz you could pull that you could you could you could go there without no no this is spirituality as opposed to religion right it has to do with introspection really looking it was self really looking at ones mind trying to trying to as you were just saying there's a commonality that we have with everyone try to relate on the level to come now I kind of am designating the differences which are all the material and external designating them as secondary or third day are you don't like like not so important and elevating the primary consideration which is spirit and on that level we were all connected on that level we're all similar you know I've been thinking about this right now do you know going this internal growth in all of that
it was me yeah stay with me here I'm thinking with you because I think as neophyte Yogi's
 we we liked it you know we hear this message me saying all this is a nice message God is in my heart wherever I go right but even though we we accept that in theory what we feel is yes theoretically God is in my heart but primarily my weariness is caught up in living with everybody in this world and I like some I don't like some is some cause anxiety and some cause pleasure in so just got to my heart by my my Consciousness my weariness is absorbed in these people
 and really where we need to get what we need to feel
 is that all these people are here
 but primarily I'm always living with God in my heart like that's who I'm that's you understand like that's my first
it's on that level that that my mind is operating on primarily friend and therefore my my relations with all the people of this world that's the secondary consideration
 the one that first consideration is in place and I'm able to relate and understand how to relate with all these other people on a completely spiritual level which transforms everything just do the bring us back to the Nugget very good. Thank you I was very good and nobody would know. Kaur said and I'll I'll call back a minute.
 And
 I usually I usually going to be right out without giving them credit and I take the credit for it but he said he's going to a synagogue or mosque or church ashram and Co how nice people are worshipping my Lord and a different way right away at a different different rituals different customs with the ideas and trying to connect with Source Miss Mara
