 all right
 this is from Louis L'Amour do you know who that was born the more I don't listen American novelist and short-story writer his books consisted primarily western novels though he called his work Frontier stories
 Western fiction fiction Works include last of the breed the walking drum on do shalako and the second series Harpo want you got a Honda I mean
 is it killing thing
 it kills the man who angers
 preach rage leaves in West
does you know who I'm picturing saying this who's that actor you know what the big mustache and does the Western things separate riddles the guy that's Ikea okay dude you know you go ahead and be like that dude okay. I don't know Samuel yet but I can do it in my voice changer is a killing thing it kills the man who angers for each rage weaves him less than he had been before it takes something from him I love I love this one all right I mean I mean I can look outward it's easy to look out where you see people who like to look at lost their cool at Chick-fil-A you know what I mean ice cream
over-the-counter like how do you live with yourself after one of those episodes what are you doing in Chick-fil-A who just like lose their but you know I've lost my cool I've lost my cool I've been pushed to the edge of my my sanity and it's just like it's it's humiliating
 and anger isn't the only two that Corrine Hills Natalie depleted you feel less than yourself you feel dirty
 yeah you know I said Sharon on the show before that you know I said you know back when we were kind of new to this whole body thing and I'm kind of join the Army in a sense to know when the Army but at least in the army or like okay going to be 4 years for us it's more like a timeline with an H like when we get out of here for the beds
go out and some like ignominious way I still got it
 but I guess he has a monk you know that there was if there was kind of a bit of a military kind of you know a bit of authority hey if you know there was a package there was a pecking order and it was kind of acceptable to kind of blos blow off some steam at someone and take somebody down a notch and that kind of thing you know it was like ruin you but you don't expect that from the guy who joined three weeks before you you know that come on man in the water running like 30 seconds longer anyway because it's so
I was a little like that I wasn't super like that but I did have my moments you know of chastising me yes you do we talkin about angry with you I cannot chew you out
 I think so oh yeah I think it's good
 probably I'll tell you I think you just have it in your mind you want one year before me Mara one year before I met you by chance license to rip me on the regular remember I laid into in the Breezeway of the Philadelphia Temple about what about what about
I'm not going to get into distribution
 mystical City
 agree with us but yet we're still scared of
 you guys did manage to the show today but you're scared isn't it
 okay I know it's like there's like 15 at when you're growing up liking the vena in the in the neighborhood there's only like one father in the house that you're like scared of like scared of those guys Halloween is going to go to that house my father was that you were that I had you know I did that and the one time I laid into this one devotee and he did after I was done he just said to me now I see you're just like all the
I got it now you just need to come lose your mind and just be this guy he was a real Yogi like before he became like a brahmacharya he he wanted up in the Himalayas and all that and meditating saxena and he tried to eat right if you don't remember what it was about but he got you the whole thing actually I don't think I was even laying into him I think was saying to someone else and he's but he was observing and and he said that to me look at you now I see you're just like the others you know you're you're you you're usually don't show your mind and we set it as like this I felt depleted I felt like I had some
 some part of my stuff in and I from that point on
the point here is to anger around some people do it in just like this they try to play it off really spiritual but they're actually doing the exact same thing you just like to try to cut you down for what we talked about his anger I know but I'm just thinking there could be anger their disguise as mr. peaceful ever meet one of those hey man baby I think you should examine yourself you know I mean it's it's all motivated by ego well that's okay let's run with that okay because this is the thing it is all motivated by ego and the greater the ego
 the greater the rage
 you know that the greater my ego is the more I feel that I have the the entitlement to control and one that's in one act when I am when I feel like my control is not being mean
 followed
 you know then I become angry now you take
person with the biggest ego
 turn your coochie poo that were reading about right now right to ask you how your time this in yeah he's about to go into rage just because his son you know like his son play mr. peaceful well actually dad your a shame this time you're going to go to hell very dark lady come angry and yell at their children something like that he says kill this child might because his ego is so big that that that the the stronger that the level that rage and this is an important thing recognized for our own practice right cuz if we do fly into fits of rage and anger
 we can understand the intensity of it has to do with the intensity of our ego but what he says here when he says
 for each rage leaves him less
then he had been before I think we need to ask ourselves when we go into anger and rage what exactly
 do we lose as a box of Yogi right as opposed to you and this is what I would suggest
 is that
 boti
 you notice that the love that is expressed about the it's kind of the polar opposite of Envy right that the stronger and be the stronger our rage
 and so boxy means I have to have this heart that's often on and I actually feel appreciation respect for every living being in this is what she cheats on you tells us right I'm on an Amana Dana kirtan your salary if I want to go deep into the meditative chanting of this Mantra experience all the full transformation I have to respect every living being in my ego has to be so low that even if I'm not respected doesn't bother me at all
yeah cuz my cuz I don't have the eagle that needs that is now during the course of the day that affects you sitting down and chanting brother not to just going exactly where I'm going here because that's it for today
 no cuz there's a thing if you're on the internet and you're typing away and raging on people right
 you got anything that is never reply to people on threads Reigns your integrity like you're like you're making your statement don't cares
 no one's changing from your comment is that can affect them in a deep what is your own heart when you're engaging it that way and you can't just flip it back and snap back into it like soft hair
you actually hardening your heart with that it's a friend of mine are shared with me in and I'll do you like this like you know there's different ways to tune a guitar rather than classical music you make tuna one way and then you might flip around is that right Jeff Eisenberg you can jump jump
 yeah our evening like you know Keith Richards he's got this certain way to his guitar that you played yourself you'll never get it because the guitar is tuned different
 so like if you have your guitar tuned one way and you can't just turn around and start playing this other kind of music on it because it's out of tune for that right
 okay G-Eazy Keith tune to drop off just like you can start to play the other kind of music once it's been tuned one way it's going to take you time
you can have to sit down you're going to have to do this whole thing with it similarly if you're turning your heart with anger with envied based on ego and you do that on the regular what you know what's the secret to her like a fool to put it on the internet over nothing we're just going off on these things when you go to turn into your Pooja when you going to pick up your bead bag and Chan you're not just going to flip a switch and suddenly being soft-hearted swiger know how you're going to still have the rage and anger in your heart in that heart so it's real important know that's why it when people get into these things like different types of intoxicants and stuff it's not like just cuz we're still like we are anti-drugs it's what they do is they medicate your emotions and they don't let you feel feelings and him it's important to feel feelings and work through feelings why am I angry at the sky why am I losing my mind off this guy cut me off
who went through all the traffic and I snuck into the very front why am I losing my mind over that somebody why do I get easily triggered why do I walk around say don't trigger me oh that's triggering I need to say why am I why am I so damn triggered when I can answer these questions and deal with those emotions and I just try to not try to make the whole world do backflips so I'll be peaceful that's not going to happen
 when I need is I need to work on why I'm rage why I'm triggered why I get easily offended and not trying to medicate I need to go home get stoned I need you home too you know when I might My Generation have a martini Martini my parents generation was they sit down with a glass of liquor and you know a few shots of scotch or something that's in my father just sit and drink you know just to get the edge
but I have that we don't want to get the edge off you want to deal with that are all the scotch when they couldn't even afford Mrs Butterworth

 Noah's father freaks out when he gets angry he rages every parent verify that your parent listening to this
 haven't had a moment when they're sort of like losing it and their child 5 years old gives them some deep sanguine sober instruction if you have a child
 and that happened to you please write that on the board
 after prolonged Mirage had spoken in this way and become silent or any cuz she poop blinded by anger real him off his lap onto the ground right there cross the line but it's in your purse
 yeah how could you do that to sweet little prelati
 sometimes I yell at my kids when they were little for yelling at each other
and I was like oh I get it they're learning all their bad habits for me and then you felt the pleated
 yeah I feel like a dumb dumb indignant and angry has reddish after provided spoken this way and become silent right I'm ready I should poop blinded by anger threw him off his lap and onto the ground ouch not good indignant and angry has reddish eyes like molten copper around me cuz you post said to his servants take this boy away from me he deserves to be killed kill him as soon as possible
 ouch
 that's the eagle in the greater the ego the greater the rage
 he had a huge ego
sneaking this boy provide is the killer of my brother meaning he supported the bad guys who are Lord Vishnu so he's the killer of my brother for he is giving up his family to engage and bhakti devotional service to the enemy Lord Vishnu like a menial servant problem like I'm your servant exactly that's a good thing we want to be a menial servant and provide is also remember the main steam is coming from Pilates that he does not have the ability to see in terms of friends and enemies
 it's just a very foreign idea to him but you know what I realized today right and I think that's here in a wonderful glad I wasn't another class by by radhika Ramon. You think I'd like his classes I think you would like I think you should listen to this one I was wondering if they're going to be all right hand
but they might not be your cup of tea that's the question this question did today is you use up a lot of examples from TV shows from the 70s in this class is okay but he was he was he was speaking of the glories of the bog of a Time
 what makes it so special from different angles even like how is it different from the other piranhas so but one thing that I shared was is he started speaking about when giant vgi were cursed by the four Kumaris John and we read about this phone back in the third canto
 giant veggie where the where the Guardians to the gates if I come through the gates to the spiritual World guardian of the gates
Glad Tidings indicates random
 and and they they didn't allow the for little boys and although their grade elderly sages but they appeared in the bodies of little boys were the four little boys go ahead wouldn't let them in the it's in my contacts and then what they said to them as they're about to curse them
 was what is this
 you know vaikunta is the place where nobody sees in terms of friends and enemies right it's and he broke it down into the Sanskrit which it was basically indicate like we're all part of the same family here right we're all connected to that Divine one you know there's a spiritual unity and that's what bike want is all about and you are seeing in terms of what we're not part of that family we're not allowed in because they momentarily
manifested some level of this kind of discrimination
 they were cursed to become demons for three lives and one of them became a run you catch tapu it was right here right now right in his whole thing is that he has his whole and he's been telling you now he's got this pure devotee by Quinta minded son who can't see in terms of friends and enemies it's interesting isn't it is very interesting it's like a very very sensual
 concept that we have to we have to mull it around are in our thoughts
 and really try to adjust
 that we don't fit in a week and will be able to walk through those Gates you know his sense when we really let go of it when we really let go you know and that means letting go of our false conception of we are cuz they're saying the is the eagle that makes us rage it's our identification with a certain body with a
roll is her nationality with this all those different things that can trigger the rage through a lot didn't have it at all
 but his father had so deep such a such a strong false conception to self such a strong ego such a strong need to control
 and now he's with his beautiful boy that kill him just cuz he said a few words that that upset him
 like this
 although a lot is only five years old even if this young age he has given up the affectionate relationship with his father and mother
 he didn't have or he is certainly untrustworthy indeed is not at all believable that he will behave well towards toward Lord Vishnu is a division of you can hear it you know where is coming out right yeah although a medicinal herb being born it although a medicinal herb
born in the forest does not belong to the same category as a man if beneficial it is kept very carefully similarly if one if someone outside one's family is favorable he should be giving protection like a sun on the other hand if a limb of one's body is Poison by disease it must be a tainted so that the rest of the body may live happily simile similarly even one's own son if unfavorable must be rejected although born of One's Own body
 I should have agreed with her anyhow she poo not to kill will there is a logic to that yeah yeah there's a lot of point was a lot has a very healthy limb
 how to do you agree with the killing part 2, my daughter wants told me I'm just a kid how can I know how to do things the way you want me to do
it's pretty good it's pretty good
 slow down evil mother Melanie we were prepared as we get it
 okay
 just 3838 just as just as controlled senses are the enemies of all Yogi's this is not controlled senses are the enemies of all yogis is interesting engagement of dancing and spiritual life this prolonged who appears to be a friend is an enemy because I cannot control him there for this enemy weather eating sitting or sleeping must be killed by all means being rational about it
 this is very irrational regular well it makes sense to him
meaning meaning he's going against its rationale to kill them. Let's get them out of the household time to fly you to wanted to buy that follow the rules of the bird nest and fly away in killing is Ayo mean
 okay I'm not endorsing that I can just people I'm just putting that out there have a demon's The Rock Josh's the service of her and you catch tapu thus began striking the tender parts of prolonged mirages body with the tridents the demons all had fearful face has sharp teeth and reddish coppery beards
 and hair are they saying the demons are all Ginger
 and they appeared extremely threatening
accounts
 making a tumultuous sound shouting chop him chop a Sim they began striking prologue Mirage who sat silently meditating on the Supreme personality of godhead so what it what do you think happened was it like it just kind of like there's a force field or hurting him
 don't know
 do you ever think what now I'm just thinking about it now I had always wondered like they tried to kill him I couldn't I mean I've had experiences where my mom with the shoe at me once I do that after the scotch
 no we did something to drive her insane I'm not claiming innocence here we were crazy so she you know she uses take off her slipper and whack us with the slipper and one day she went to whack us or chasing us
catch us and then she took office or just whipped it and we docked and it went through the window so not my thing is I get it sometimes you try to punish somebody and you can't punish them but he looks like they were like they had weapons or try to strike him there they do a whole series of ways to hurt for a lot but they provide remains protected maybe they're just going right through his body like almost like a mystical thing or they fumbling I like a high drop a try with the Pokemon to try and I slipped out of my hands or face somehow it wasn't working was ineffective or sometimes you see these cop fails where they they try to arrest somebody and like they can't arrest them they're trying that they're using the stun gun that's not working this gaping or he's running away with handcuffs on them and a cop can catch him maybe something like this had like five cops chasing the car hit their all his leg falling over
 finishing running handcuffs
it happened to keep Keystone Cops behind the good old Italian backhand Laura Bina said yep you remember the day that like your mother couldn't do it anymore and if my mother could never do my father you wouldn't feel monster in my household was okay wait till your dad gets home there was that for sure
 but I do know that wooden spoon could come out you know and get any moment the weapons of course in that were passed around my home don't even have any more it is a whole different thing that other kids just rule
 I'm just saying there was a day where like she just going
it's over
 play liberation
 Tim Riley says if you see a grown man trying to kill a five-year-old kid isn't natural to feel rage are you trying to even get worse being peaceful
 trauma situation like that bro. That's probably rage if you see a devotee getting arms right it's just one person also it's just what would rage comes out of nowhere due to my own shortcomings and I've lost my cool you know I've lost my cool when I shouldn't have lost my cool just cuz I don't I'm not I don't have my Collective senses about me that's what we're talking about Tim okay even though a person has no assets in Pious activities perform some good deed it will have no results that's the weapons of the Demons had no tangible effects upon provide Mirage because
who is a devotee undisturbed by material conditions and fully engaged in meditating upon the serving the Supreme personality of godhead who's unchangeable who cannot be realized by the material senses and who is the soul of the entire universe
 I want second
 I mean look, Terry here and wonder if it's going to give us any clue a lot of Mirage was was constantly and fully engaged in thought of the Supreme personality guarded as it is said Govinda how do you run betta go in the party room Britta I guess that means his mind was always going around and thoughts of Linda Plummer has engaged himself always a meditation that he was protected by Govinda
 this is a small child in lap of his father or mother is fully protected a devotee and all in all
conditions is protected by the Supreme Lord does this mean that one prolonged Mars was attacked by the demons the rakshasas Govinda was also attacked by the demons this is not possible
 I've been many attempts by the demons her to kill the Supreme personality of godhead but he cannot be injured by any material means because he's always in Transcendence therefore the words part of Germany are used to hear demons the rakshasas can neither see nor touch the Supreme Lord although they may superficially think that they are striking the Lord's Transit nobody with a material weapons you're so some hands were getting here right like when these Invaders come to Indy and try to destroy the temples and break the deities you think you're killing me killing the Hindu god nope didn't work
 what I'm saying this in terms of when they're poking away at that provide is it
what's going on they think that they're hitting his body but somehow they're not is what it sounds like it sent you
 okay I have no explanation for this
 yeah I'm going to have to just plow forward they may think that they can kill the Supreme purse have you got it and its devotees but all their attempts will be futile as profit is a Lord knows how to deal with an idiot you can kill a devotee
 but it's like but it doesn't make their devotion go away even the death of their body it doesn't make their message go away and often times you see historically it empowers the person's message
 like make a martyr out of them you're saying I can make a martyr out of them in there like hell yes whatever he does so the person is living on
 even more like they tried to kill me or by the famous princess they tried to poison her they said she was doing in the fairies
she drank it and she meditated that this is water used to wash the feet of the DD and she lived and they were like oh my God she's a real bad down here she didn't want to be the queen she's like I'm out of here goodbye but she became like a full Pirro
 nearby Mera Bhai Mera Bhai
 okay
 42 my dear King you to steer when all the attempts of the Demons to kill prolonged Mirage refuto the king of the Demons running has she pooped the most fearful big and contriving other means to kill him the money cuz you could not kill his son by throwing him beneath the feet of big elephants that was $2 one or did it work let's try the ink rushing attempt how do you instruct an elephant
step up and make the Elephant Walk somebody I'm a hoot they know how to do that too
 throwing him among huge fearful snakes
 right they said it's a lie people have a Mystic sidhe camera wouldn't bother them snakes or poisonous animals do not bother them they like their decal in control of their their Consciousness and their mind that harmful animals will like not buy them harm them so I sort of animal Whispers of sorts I'm sure you had that City then he tried destructive spells like he's okay that the snake didn't work try this black magic that didn't work
 employee destructive spells hurling him from the top of a hill
 sometimes you see things like happened like a car accident about the baby falls out of
window or something like that in a completely fine like on the highway
 I can see that I'm trying to find like reasonable
 understandings of how he was not hurt by the end of the stuff the one that put them in boiling oil are you not good I like the next one Conjuring up illusory tricks
 I would be sort of impressed with that
 I was starving him that didn't work
 exposing of the severe cold and cold plunges putting him in the wind that didn't work fire and water or throwing heavy stones to crush him okay what is going on why can't they hurt this child when her running has she pooped found that he could not in any way harm prologue was completely seamless he was in great anxiety about what to do next.
confused at that point
 yeah
 okay next
 Harry Krishna
 last one. I have used many ill names in chastising this boy a lot and I have devised many means of killing him but in spite of all my Endeavors we cannot be cannot be killed indeed he saved himself by his own powers without being affected in the least by these treacherous and abominable actions
 why do we finish the chapter again although he is very dear to me and is merely near to me is situated in complete fearlessness
 he resembles a dog's curved tail we can never be straightened because he never forgets my misbehavior and his connection with his master Lord Vishnu
yeah I ever try to stay there for a second
 I can see that this boy's string is unlimited for he is not feared any of my punishments that's another thing do not even in the bottle of conception not only will I do it to him but he's Fearless
 I wonder if that's different from Material courage
 do they talk about sheep chhatrapati
 you know and they and his son who were like tortured and his son was tortured
 I thought that he was Fearless but I wonder if material fearlessness is the same as a transcendentalist who realizes you know what
 you can't tell me everything about that I got nothing on that okay my guess is there different though
 yeah what is Giselle like a type of stoicism and one is a pet
out of body experience I can see that this boy's strength is unlimited free is not fear any of my punishments be a bit more therefore because of my enmity towards him I shall die
 maybe this will not take place these fearful now now he's worried what it what am I what is up with me and try to get a little guy seems like he should be dead thinking in this way the king of the date is there and it's the demon race morose and bereft of bodily luster right always happens when you lose your cool remain silent with his face downward
 oh no
 Maya the cat's about to vomit
sorry that the cat is choking
 really
 okay do the heimlich maneuver
 okay 4900 Lord we know that when you simply move your eyebrows all the commanders of the various planets are most afraid without the help of I think it skipped one of them was married to that thinking in this way the king of the dyches morose and bereft of Bali last year remains silent with a space downward
