who here for first Thomas tomorrow, I'm right behind you right now
 he's a he's a he's a like a surfing Guru yoga teacher from Hamburg
 not a lot of strength account number but he goes to he's a wonderful guy and he's like an old hardcore guy too but he is a serious spiritual practitioner and came to India with us and yeah it's great to have him part of our community here is this question it's a serious question first of all thank you for the wisdom that you were sharing for so many years for so many years already till the till the day today it's my first choice to go to and he saying like up until today even though it's not me it's him
so today is my first choice to go to Alex's First Choice to go to and so I can call myself very happy to have been able to pick a great these teachings into my own life at least I try my best as I can I watch brings me to my question last November I had some kind of a switch on this Human Experience when I'm not in my left thigh which is first diagnosed as a matoma hematoma turned out to be a high-grade sarcoma a very seldom form of aggressive tumor as a doctors emphasized it was a shock at first I'm actually I'm just reading this it was a shock at first though even in the moment of a diagnosis I found myself as more in a state of the Irving the scene and to be totally in it
 the doctor said their intention is to fully heal me
but can't promise anything as it's so rare
 So I had some moments of sadness somehow most of the time I managed to stay positive giving my body this energy reading the Gita listening to Rocco's Krishna stories and the wisdom of the podcast on a daily basis which helps me stay confident beautiful then that's what we're supposed to do in times of great in a challenge like this challenge to see him go there are these moments of thoughts like what what if it doesn't turn out with a good ending and I recognize my ego taking over but this can't have been all I still wanted to do so much which brings me in a more anxious it again so my question is what would be best to stay relaxed I assume it's the path of surrendering to the whole situation
so my question is what would be best in order to stay relaxed I thought okay I soon as the path of surrendering to the whole situation what I really been trying to do for the last weeks of chemotherapy already but since and then still some anxiety pops up understandably I hope this question wasn't too long and also maybe it helps others who are in a similar situation sending you much love and hugs from Berlin Wow first to Moss we love you and it's great to have any part of this family
 and we're really honored that you sort of turn to us it's such a trying time
 isn't that's how the world goes
 that
 he expressed something you here so many times before like 1 if it doesn't turn out good and I had so many plans
that's not just your story Thomas that's the story of all living entities no one generally no one is like okay I'm planning to leave my body you know it it's generally at any moment it is so boring a fact of what you got is actually a gift and it's it it's a little it may be a little challenging to see that but
 this precariousness that the entire world is in is often just covered over we overlooked it we there's a time bomb that is taped to our chest under our shirt and we don't want to look when it's going to blow up you know sometimes people have cancer and they live for 20 years longer sometimes sometimes people just walk down the street and they're completely physically fit and ripped and strong and beautiful and get hit by a car so no one knows when we're going to leave our bodies no matter what the doctor say
no one really knows but adding spiritual life to your life on a regular basis not only melts anxiety
 and not only helps us just in living my regular life living myhealthelife living my in a work light living happy life with my family but also prepares us if life gets hold it out that pulled from a carpet it's pulled out from underneath our feet at any moment so you're doing the best and look at this as a special gift as a wow all the stuff we say in the bottom of Thomas true that life is actually temporary that that anything can happen at any moment and I was a little bit intoxicated with you know the fun of life I mean Life Is Life is also fun I know you your server you like to go to exotic places your yoga teacher you respected your
all your good looking so like life can be we can be intoxicated with our Good Fortune but the reality is everything is temporary and look at this as some little blessing to say hey everything's good right it can go south real quick and maybe that is just a little pinch
 that Christian is giving us giving you truthfully giving me when I hear your story I'm hearing it in myself that hey
 Anything could happen at any moment maybe take this to the next level maybe turn it up a notch maybe get into our hearing
 barsaat song you're hearing a spiritual Sound Vibrations on a more regular basis on a deeper level maybe it's time to journal a little bit more but these things are always beautiful wake up calls no matter how it turns out how it turns out that's up to God your karma
but these are all accelerators are trampolines for a spiritual life so
 you must be doing something right because this this type of this type of thing I don't mean to sound callous at all it's something that we all need to hear and that when we hear it from you we should also take it seriously in us you know this is we're hearing it for ourselves I'm hearing that oh yeah life is over here with Mara on the beach in Goa this is this whole world is temporary that is what I'm hearing for myself right now don't get so intoxicated with my watermelon juice
 Toshiba
 thank you Robin. You know I'll start as you did and just Express you do my concern for Tomas my appreciation and you know my heartfelt feelings for him that it was a bit shocking to hear this question so you know
we're here for you really please feel free to reach out to run off to myself you know as you're going through this now you know don't don't be shy for that now what you're going through
 it's some you know we we we we read our books and we tell our stories and we speak our philosophy
 but if it never gets put to the test we never really quite quite find out how deep it's gone you do not know our faith is that one who has this spiritual realize we could call it Brahman realization you call it spiritual realization the realization that I am Spirit right that I'm not this body that I'm not this mind that I am a spark of spiritual energy hummus bar I'd like like the the rays are to the Sun
 I am 22 to that part of Brahman to that or
all existence that origin of all life shree Krishna I'm a spark of his fire I'm made out of out of Eternity knowledge and Bliss that's what I am it's a nice philosophy it sounds nice like how deep have we invited when we imbibe it fully when it's fully imbibes our anxiety and life will be gone are suffering and life will be gone and it sounds to me like you've imbibed it partially by hearing regularly by tuning into this podcast in hearing Bob with Tom and so on you can buy the two large. So even though you're going through such a challenging circumstance
 facing your own mortality you're saying to a large degree you're experiencing it more as a witness than as a victim
 and that is very interesting and that's very encouraging that means is a seeking in and it's growing in Eunice getting deeper in you
on your path you are on your path you you have made positive steps forward on your path to return ality your path to realizing your return out to fully experience in your turnout to your you're moving forward and at the same time it's not surprising that you would report to us that sometimes that anxiety sets in sometimes you were you feeling what is this isn't going to end well and end those haunting thoughts
 of One's Own mortality you know Rising you so that's to be expected I believe you know that's that your person that's on the path you haven't you haven't traversed the entire batch yet take heart you know I have no fear keep moving forward understand that it's going to be a little scary you know we we certainly hope you know that this is Christmas as well as run I send this is one way or another to
the wise the wise person sees it as a gift because this is where that
 call already you've made advancement on this path and it's in his challenges like this that will accelerate that advancement that will deepen that that that understanding that will make it more deeply firmly rooted in you
 so my hope in my you know what I expect is that that you'll get over this but you'll come out the other end of it stronger deep or more deeply realized and we don't know perhaps this is unit perhaps you won't come out of her you know perhaps any one of us could pass away before you do we don't know we're all a little drop of water you do on a waxy Lotus leaf that could slip off at any moment slip into you know our next Incarnation are our next situation
and in that sense we're all in one sense are alone with no one to reach out to but that origin of all existing fact that beautiful Shri Krishna you're feeling that now it's scary I guess it's good that scariness that's part of what it takes to have you had this party would you have to pass through
 to come out the other side so Pastor with courage has to do with knowledge Pat passed through taking the shelter in The Help from the srimad bhagavatam and from those spiritual contacts you have in your life and will end in again we're with you here reach out to us some reach out to us when you feel the need and end in and we're here with you Thomas thank you for sharing this stuff your your thoughts in your realization
 you're serious question and
 material world is
a you use this expression
 a drop of water on a lotus petal right you can give her some water on Lotus petals are waxy so the water will be turned into a ball and roll off that beat off I say that existence is like ever see the kids play this game where they put a spoon in their mouth and they back trying to balance an egg on the spoon and they have to run and it's like a relay race or something like that for a birthday party our life is like that we we have to we have this crazy idea that were solid and that were firm in that we're strong and that you know we're indestructible and it's just like quite the opposite and it doesn't take much analyzation of life and then when something does happen which is completely normal
 then we're all struck with Wonder and this deep sobriety like how I can't believe that it is obvious
Edward should be obvious all along right right there in her face
 yeah and so the real blessing is that
 that's what we do for fun we we like try to imbibe truth on a regular basis and so it's not such a jarring thing when their so-called material tragedy not only thing that jarring but it becomes like it becomes the whole experience becomes sweet
 they become a become a bit because we see ourselves in krishna's hands in the same way a mother cat is gripping the the baby cat by the nape of the neck it's we don't feel with there's not that that fear to the degree that we in by the spiritual truth the wisdom literature anxiety melts otherwise the whole world is riddled with anxiety and if you're not feeling anxiety you're crazy
break the two spirituals been understand there is no death there is no birth or Eternal beings
 many ways you are in a beautiful place around beautiful people thank you Tomas
 and this from another another listener who's been through massive challenges when she moved to Texas Ashley Rodriguez no stranger to our Q&A day she went through so much crazy stuff with her husband three little babies husband got a horrible motorcycle accident and she just applied spiritual truths to a material tragedy
 and she's just got a new credibles station so let's see what she says today love friends I was hoping you could talk some about a relationship with Rod her as a devotee of Krishna
so much love and connection with Krishna when I see him but not so much with rata I feel like I'm missing out on something thank you so much for everything you all continue to do with so much love and gratitude
 we're great if we really unique tradition that worships the divine
 feminine along with the Divine masculine Radha and Krishna worship
 matter fact we say she even gets a Christian do you have to worship Radha
 so yeah this is this is maybe a very poignant question how do you develop a love of Radha this tube you want to jump in on this question because it's like we walking to Temple we see trout in Krishna
 right on the altar right we we have our paintings in our homes and paintings of radha-krishna together
but when we hear from the shastra and hear from speakers we hear most about Christian we hear very little bit of Radha
 and so I think the first thing we need to dress is wise that and it has to do
 with understanding that
 Radha Radha Rani is really the most sacred aspect of our faith right it's like she is held as most sacred and
 and the topic of the love
 between rotten Krishna is
 in efforts to keep keep it sacred to keep our understanding of a sacred in our approach to its sacred
 that's that's part of the challenge of handing it down because we are very prone
to approach this world within which is the spirit of I am the enjoy our
 and when we read about the Amorous
 pastimes of radha-krishna right there in a romantic context
 then we're very prone to to interpret that through our own condition thinking
 and either to see it from the perspective of our own material enjoyment
 or to misunderstand it as being ordinary in some way as being similar to how we understand Amorous love
 and so the topic of rata you know even
 even in the human body with time
 we don't hear write his name you know that desert DHHR is the teachers on the state they say she's mentioned once and they're even
we hear about the gopis we don't hear Rod his name and it said that Sugardale goswami as he's reciting Baba time he didn't recite the name of Rod
 because he felt he might him he himself might be overwhelmed with spiritual emotion just by the mention of your name
 and so all of that food for many reasons it's it's kept very secret we if we want to hear about Rado we should be really careful to hear from the right sources and improper supposed especially a place that we can go to cheat on your charts and Rita
 and I into chapters in particular there's there's fascinating beautiful
 beautiful information about Iran Ian you know
 the author chasing a charging rate is a shrew
krishnadasi kavi Raja Raja means
 cubby means poet IV Raja means like the king of poets
 and it's a fact that to speak on such a sacred and beautiful delicate
 subject
 it has to be expressed through poetry
 and only by the most sensitive person
 and so so to hear about Rado we can go to the chase any charge mutant The Works of Christian Discovery Ride and the
 I think it's the fourth chapter of the ADI Lila there's a chapter that describes the
 the confidence reasons for the appearance of Sri chaitanya just a few verses from that chapter I'm not going to read it in detail is to Chapters this also and the mug yalila chapter 8 which is the conversations between
onion and ramen under Roy it's another place that chapter is so chock-full of the most beautiful mesmerizing
 information about Radha Rani it's it's it's it's such a masterpiece
 but again it's considered a very confidential topics not one that we're going to talk about too much publicly So This Is Christmas cubby right she wrote this in that in that fourth chapter that I believe he said he's describing a proper world first you said
 you said this is
 this is this resume the verses from the chapter that says Lord garonga who Shri Hari himself who's Chris himself accepted the sentiments of rata unless he fulfilled his own desires
 oh no here okay cuz I wanted to do this for this from
he says this chapter specifically describes the difference between lust and love
 transactions of Krishna and Radha are completely different from Material lust there for the author's very carefully distinguish between them
 so he was Christmas cubby Raj he wanted us to understand who treat your tongue is and treat a tongue is Krishna fascinated by Rod is love wanting to understand it wanting to experience a coming as a devotee so that he can follow in the footsteps of her at her
 and so do understand that we to understand our love we have to understand the difference between lust and love and so Christmas call you I just going to expound on that and then describe rata
 so is this mood of this mood the mood of the love of the residence of Randolph in the intimate love for Krishna
 this mood is unbounded in the damsels of Raja the damson from Diamond to go pee
but among them it Finds Its perfection in Sri Radha these are verses from the chapter her Pure Mature love surpasses that of all others but love is the cause of Lord Krishna space in the sweetness of the conjugal relationship
 therefore Lord chaitanya who's Christian self accepted the sentiments of Radha and that's what killed his own desires in a few verses down as the loving Affairs if she Radha and Krishna are transcendental manifestations of the Lord's internal pleasure giving potency
 although Radha and Krishna are one in their identity they separated themselves eternally now these two transgender identities have began United in the form of Sri Krishna chaithanya I bow down to him was manifested himself with a sentiment in the complexion of she might be right around me although he is Christmas elf
 and he writes therefore I shall first to linnaean
Lenny delineate the position of Rod and Krista from that description the glory of lordship Tony will be known she might see radhika is the transformation of Christmas love she is his internal energy called adeiny letting me is the devotional love that gives pleasure
 it gives the deepest pleasure the deepest pleasure that exists that Ladena energy gives Krishna pleasure and it gives Krishna pleasure and a nurse is his devotees so therefore we worship brought up because through are trying to understand Route 11 through a worshipping Radha and her mood her devotion her love we are nourished with love for Krishna
 Eminem towards the end of that chapter Christmas coverage right after he spoken a bit about brought his love he writes all these
Hoosiers are unfit to disclose in public but if they're not disclosed no one will understand them therefore I shall mention them revealing only their asses so that loving devotees will understand them but fools will not end so you know there's some
 there's so much in that chapter there's this other Most Fascinating chapter
 is a chapter the really needs to be heard from and studied under someone who has a deep understanding of it but the 8th chapter the monkey Lila were shoot you Tanya speaks to Ramen in ask him recite a verse from the reveal scriptures concerning the ultimate goal of life
 in ramen under Roy he gives his he starts on one level which is basically like being a dutiful person and shoot attorney says no go deeper and he keeps climbing up a ladder of steps in devotional love
and entry to Tanya's not satisfied he keeps telling climb higher climb higher
 and eventually gets to the love of the residence for David he said now you're getting summer keep going and then he gets to the love of the gopis inside now you're really getting somewhere and then finally he concludes with the love of shrimati Radha Rani
 and then he goes into a long description of very beautiful poetic description of who Radha is in the nature of her a lot so we can hear about route is love if we search for it and we hear from the right people I really recommend that you hear that through Sheila provides books has probably took great pains so that we understand it correctly maybe you could share a little I could reach you if you would like to you know I first wanted to say I completely get it when we're dealing with the teachings of boxing in the beta tradition it's it's it's quite impressive it's that I was to say okay we're going to do
math here's the chalkboard we're going to write the math on the chalkboard 1 + 1 Apple + 1 Apples to Apples it's pretty simple I can explain that math but if we're talkin about
 doing that same type of math on a recall this calculators
 I'll come on Merrillville high school and I'm not I guess I'm going to look at those professional scientific calculators it's like a whole different thing and what if I said break apart the calculator you don't have to chalk works on a chalkboard has a calculator work it's like that's a whole nother deal they both have a function they're both useful but the calculator is just a little bit more complicated and the math is more complicated to 1 + 1 is still Maps when we say love God okay we take that where we got to be devotees we got to be devotional service who won't engage my work in the service of Krishna
makes sense so but this is a very like this this this
 this ocean goes very very deep and therefore to the degree that you want to know more it it reveals itself so to the degree that we want to know about Radha Rani
 is a healthy desire first of all you're doing everything right
 you don't feel like you're missing out on anything but second while you start asking those questions and then all of a sudden you'll find
 people who give windows are people who give into that type of relationship authors or speakers and to the degree that you have a hankering for it it'll it'll manifest to you as well but don't feel like
 you should know more by now or
it's all math and you're all your moving forward in your spiritual life but to the degree that you hear about these personalities to that degree you'll fall in love with these Personalities in the same will befall Krishna how do you fall in love with Krishna to hear about Krishna so that's true cuz she was giving the classic ones to go Swami's have also written books about the pastimes of rotting Krishna and you can fall in love with those and they're out there and they're translated
 but that's how we fall in love with anybody we here
 and I would recommend I really recommend strongly that to approach those books you really Repro buys books first so that you'll have his lens to read them through have his Lance reason to I think it's a little esoteric but I think we here will get you something of avalor my time
Senate and House special in and how sacred Radha is sure and also hint of why it's not spoken about so much publicly so this is from the introduction to the body Lila she'll probably is writing it says Radha and Krishna display their Past Times
 true Christians internal energy right is completely spiritual energy
 the pleasure potency of Chris of Christmas internal energy
 is a most difficult subject matter
 unless one understands what Krishna is one cannot understand it so the pleasure potency gun that's called the bloody knee shock is one of Christians energies it's the energy of boxes the energy of love it's the pleasure posie meaning the deepest pleasure is the pleasure of divine love
 andrada is the personification of that energy she is the personification of Christmas pleasure potency so there's nothing more beautiful there's nothing more
make sure there's nothing more perfect and she personifies in now he says Krishna does not take just try to hear this try to understand it does not take any pleasure in this material world we do we try to take pleasure in this material world and so this can be difficult for a 70 70 prices and what a clue
 to the esoteric teachings of Auntie that he's going to share her Christian does not take any pleasure in this material world but he has a pleasure potency so that he has a totally spiritual policy that he takes pleasure in connecting with in uniting with and loving because we are part and parcel of Krishna
 this pleasure potency is within us also is where made of Christians Energies
 because we are part and parcel of Christian displeasure policies within us also but we are trying to exhibit the
pleasure potency in matter
 so we're we are made of of the potency that can give love to Krishna and please Krishna and be perfectly situated in that love but we're taking that potency that Divine energy that were made of and Miss using it misdirecting it and so we focus it towards matter
 he says Krishna however does not make such a vain attempt he's not interested in the things of the temporary matter this world he's only interested in that Divine love that's all he takes pleasure in you know something you know there's this example that sometimes used to visit the Chicora bird
 yep that your car alright that's it was special one to subsist on raindrops and there's one that's assist subsist on Moonlight includes the Chicora and the chocolate bar
I think it's a chuck chuck a bird that it's it won't drink any water from the ground it will only drink is only interested in water that is falling from the sky once it touches the ground it's not going to touch it. So it's very patient sometimes it's going thirsty it's a connoisseur right and it's it's only an inn we were meant to become like that that we we we become like Christian not interested
 in the so-called
 love of this world that is really lost right there that is really built on selfishness rather than selflessness
 so again he wears Krishna however does not mate however I'll go back and see because we are part and parcel of Krishna the pleasure of potencies within us also but we are trying to exhibit that pleasure potency and Mater Christi Harbor does not make such a vain attempt the object of Christians pleasure potency is Radha Rani kripa exhibits his poems
or energy as Radha Rani and then engages and loving affairs with her
 in other words Christian does not take pleasure in the external energy but exhibits his internal energy is pleasure potency as Radha Rani that's Christian manifest himself as Radha Rani she's a manifestation of his energy in order to exhibit is internal pleasure potency of the men extensions expansions and incarnations of the Lord
 and there's so many bright powerful you know mahavishnu was universes are coming out of his skin right but you're probably right of the many extensions expansions incarnations of this pleasure potency Rada
 is the foremost to Chief because she's nothing but pure love right there Force you so stay there for when we see her on that altar
 in one sense she's even more sacred to us and Krishna right because all that she embodies
is what is is
 it's a nurse Because You're Made Of Christmas potency but it's not coming out of us or it's being misdirected in it and in them and causing us so much suffering
 so he hasn't brought the charge we need to understand this to the teachings of Sheila Provident and if we we are standing there then we'll make sure to point we can redo another places to but there's so much death do understand what your problem is written on Anuradha and you know we really we need you and I. We need to make deep arrangements for
 further arrangements for people to go deeper into these subjects and I think hopefully the coming year we can help develop an academy where we can have courses in discussions on these kind of things you know it's important to have a desire or hearing about rotten krishna's pastimes it's also important
they like Fools Rush In also sometimes we go into things and we still haven't even cleaned up our material Consciousness we still can't control our senses our mind our tongue our belly are genitals we think we can understand like this esoterica we're not allowed in we're not allowed in it will just seem like a cartoon robin krishna's past several seem like a cartoon to us Krishna will seem like a cartoon character for us we have to do the right difficult work first there's no jumping over there's no jumping over steps they have to climb these steps an appropriate way and
 and yet not rush into things where it's like forbidden enough for B is it just like the waters over our head often times it's the key to this Inn in what was being mentioned earlier when I was reading some verses from the fourth chapter
 ADI ADI Lila
what is the distinction between lust and love what is the distinction between True Divine love and the Warped reflection of that that we have in this world is that one is entirely selfless and one has been contaminated or
 what's the weather looking for
 I think the word
 like when you corrupted has been corrupted by selfishness and as long as we're corrupted by selfishness we don't really understand it and so therefore devotional service is there that we serve and we can we cultivate selfless service and that's selfish service helps facilitate our understanding and our receptivity to the mercy of understanding what is pure Divine love
 like that
you know we don't have a lot of time left I was thinking of you skip to the last question I have a little I did a little research for them and run okay from Aaron via email this is a less serious question but I'm curious are there any stories of Krishna with cats my cat is constantly trying to steal my Sandalwood Mala beads I'm wondering if it could have any significance or is he just mischievous
 interesting I know Christian is got a monkey
 I know Christian has a dog and I know he is a bird
 I've never heard of a cat do you know the only thing I was trying to think of cat cat cat I know he comes as half man half cat when it comes as long as it doesn't count. Where we going at it before we go anywhere trivia question what is the name of Christmas monkey
 krishna's monkey
let me go deep deep deep deep deep deep The Message Board get no don't Google it sir I'm looking at your left hands both hands are at his name is monkey's name is Daddy Louis daddy Louis yes it is. Iloba good job which means what's daddy Loba. He is eager to eat yogurt yes he's eager for your great name for a monkey
 he's a greedy greedy for yoga reading for yoghurt yeah I thought of that I also thought Krishna Wears Like a tiger claw necklace other than that I couldn't come up with any cat stuff
 yeah I'm Tiger Tiger Claws or a thing there are suspicious people wear them as a necklace is hurting him so tigerbook Krishna did
tigerclaw but yeah I'm known here about cats either so I think you just have a mischievous cat Aaron has got nothing to do with he wants to he could be could be a devotee he just wants to change our boat is trying to let you try to talk to you know I need more chance to get my life what what are you doing why you wasting your time Aaron so they could be maybe the cat is taking the Joppa and trying to like try to snatch a Sam I think you should flip that store and it's not a mistress cat your mischievous and you better get your act together that's what the cats trying to tell you cats trying to tell us all that the cat induce you to write down afraid to just like you know like it is
 no cat you know that's the cat and juicy to write this email read it on the show so we could sit here and chastise people like Lori pack on the Chiefs have you Channel your shopping today any stellar
can I get shopping today what is going on with you guys the cat wants to know and cold snow sorry I'm just joking
 alright so here's the research I did right. I went to the Shri radha-krishna going to Daisha Deepika the lamp that illuminates you rotten Christmas to your Associates the book is just listening other associates a list there so she has been a list who they were and Christian is Lila that were Lord satanas Lila
 for example what is it what is it a book called radhakrishna ganapathy pecan okay I will and what does it tell them about the previous births to tell that we're all about it just list who all their social t r o okay just gives a running list of names and what they do all right what you got so much Angela Angela
unga to Changi money custody hung c1c Priya and other cows are most dear to Shri Krishna in our known as the best of cow's favorite house he's got the truth about these names of the cows on his mama's
