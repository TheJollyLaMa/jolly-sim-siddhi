You know
we've we're speaking you know a month or two ago about the idea of us having a nice time here in my personal day dreaming and like feels right from here we started do those kind of ice cream things like serve out the food so that the prasada in the old school way but it's such a nice way the best part of that serve out is when I went to the floor is when you're finally done you go to them with your hands folded and you say can you please let me know please no no I'm very happy and I know I can let me satisfy you a little but that's the culture is the culture in it and she just did a great job you know she like the details she heard it out she took it in since you just started offering it when I get to see the culture gets handed some of these people on this trip it's like they've been practicing boxing for many lifetimes feels
and anyway it's something it's very nice to have faces we see unzoom or people don't know cuz they're others it's nice to have them here in person but actually the old entire 11 East family here all ya couldn't Karina Tallassee Prema and and baby majoria it's really nice. It's a blast isn't she 10 years old it's a cross between chastising me for something inappropriate and then like 150 g to slow cuz then she's memorizing Tarboro me some heat around a lot of very powerful knowledge wisdom from previous life. I just started Benedictine calling people are giving them benedictions but right now back to your for but she's also gave me a wonderful gift today but she gave me a scarf that she needed
she is working with Mara in this in this car factory employees or 44 cents an hour get together during the podcast can you talk about Italy cuz talking about we're going to come together for Italy and we just going to announce that we have whistled at ages are treating Italy June 11th through 18th and you can sign up on the website wisdom of the ages. Calm it's a great time of year to go to Italy because I don't know if you know this is one of these very high traffic places and this is right before the peak season where it's still warm and it's still nice out but the flights were not that expensive you know what people could do this year it's not crowded is it apply to New York
 they could come in because we always do a retreat on the on the ROTC at your weekend in New York
so you would let you know that would probably be like Friday and Saturday and Sunday morning and then you fly out that Sunday night or the next Monday morning unless Raphael answer because you're a week earlier models going to sing that Thursday before I'll be off so you could do Upstate New York Lottery goes right into the weekend or at the art Retreat that goes right into the Italy Retreat come live with us forever what if we had our ashram hear people could stay for lengthy periods of time you know what when you hang out in these holy places that are just steeped in wisdom by wisdom doesn't always mean it wasn't sometimes wisdom is very weighty to tell you today I'm at this very nice probably cycle
 and he wrote a poem you sent me a poem I didn't quite understand what the poem about heartbreak and things like that and I can relate to that cuz I remember be joining the ashram I I wrote a song Modern Love Story is about what you know what as a teenager what we wanted at him
in the world that was just sort of often times it's built directly caught love but it's built off sometimes of selfishness and my needs and we how we romanticize love but it's sort of I think the whole world the material world the whole thing is romanticize. And there's some very ugly truth we're going to get to the camp fire last night with this person said you know he was married and hit three little children that the youngest being 6 months old and loves his wife and wife just one day I decided I'm not into this I think you're in a cult and I'm taking three kids and he got he got court orders against him and he said
 you don't we were the story of King checked your K2 with it he prays for a son and them save said the sun will be the greatest cause your happiness the greatest cause you distress and the Sun dies and he loses it breaks down cry
the Sun comes back to life and says I've had millions of problems which one are you and then it's your kids you learned his lesson I wish it could be that simple but a lot of them we can get her heart broken we have lost somebody betrayed us.
 We can't even function in the world anymore and he said I had a nervous breakdown. I just lost my mind I feel and you could think about the material that we say no life in it was Life Is Good t-shirts and polish everything but it's a temporary world and when you try to polish that up to be an eternal world where everything is just going to work out wrinkle-free you set yourself up for disaster so the poem was break and loss and wish the desired to Repose his love
 in something eternal
right and it's human when I said I missed it yesterday or today it was something about it's okay to have a quote soulmate when we we use that a lot but don't misplace the soulmate to be your God because your soulmate in every sense of the word is temporary their bodies are temporary they might all of a sudden I decided I don't like you anymore or they might die before you die before they die or something but don't let that person be your God has gotten yourself up even your source of Happiness exactly right it's not like that person is my source of happiness is something that's within me that becomes a realistic situation where they want the person and we saw it were person omas's held emotionally hostage
 because they want to that you like you feel responsible for somebody's happiness and it showed a projected sometimes on you and pain supposed to do that to other people sometimes people do it to us but it's also a type of
sick dysfunction of the material a sick type of codependent that becomes very sad that people are kept on a Long Leash there feel incredibly smothered and we call it love
 and it's really just a type of like bad decision like just trying to find some footing in the world and if you have the saddest it's over your head be very very careful about going into relationship thinking this guy or this girl will fix me they're not going to fix you you're going to bring your mind to that relationship and you going to get a burst of like I'm important she loves me he loves me but that's not going to be the key to to fix it you got to do your own work sits in when you're single it's like the least important thing to do work on yourself but that's the most important time to do it you look Doctor Phil over here today happy birthday happy birthday by the way it's been wonderful
I just feel very very grateful about that cake for you about you for a long time I sponsor the feast and I go now we already got these guys right they're going to get him a really good cake I didn't know that that was one of those wonderful to be able to serve that cake thank you Mara
 she's nice she's not answering her phone now I feel grateful and so many levels I feel grateful to be here with you you've been my dear friend for so long and to be able to serve like that little
 and endoscopy with service
 to be able to talk this morning even as we're even versus brush my teeth everything I said
 if if if I could just take care of what you want to do whatever you doing and that's a wonderful feeling that's a blessing that I've had in my life
sometimes you know you talkin today we went to some special places the last place I was talking about how
 we never see them building a massive skyscrapers in New York it starts with like these boys are up and their pets that cuz they have to get these beams down so you can look through a hole sometimes. What's going on there but you can tell something massive is about to happen something massive by the way they're sending everything got the whole city block out that's how I feel about body right now it's like something massive is about to happen and we're at the foundation of it the foundation is should have prop hunt came here and he resurrected body and there's like a tsunami like when they have tsunamis cuz I follow hashtags and I was the water goes out so far that everyone's I can shock like have you ever seen the water go out that far have you ever seen I've never seen the water why is the tide so low and they don't realize there
it's going way back cuz it's about to end and date the entire Village or town and I feel like probably coming was that deep Foundation the tide pull the Tacoma typos out there under current undertale and then all of a sudden it's going to crash and where it's exciting to be here they're just building up this massive dome for the Temple of the planetarium and it's it's so impressive to see the labor of love by thousands of devotees doing this contributing physically doing it supporting moving to this like they did Village at. Here my porzeczka betak Village is so nice to see young kids here just doing their thing around and couples and you know just dedicated couples and their parents are dedicated and just that dedication to Krishna and it those early years with probably does devotees were just said I'm just dedicated to my Google this
giving it to my Guru instead of having fauser plan B's and plan season plan these are like you know what this life is for my Guru and it's a beautiful one pointed intelligence and from that magnificent masterpieces that created magnificent magnificent so yeah
 we went on a boat yesterday we did talk about the boat out of chanting boat on the ganga I put it on Instagram like a lot of people saw it I think I post it as well just chanted is really lovely devotees chanted my enchanted do y'all chanted that was special there was quite a few special things about it at the Agora Artie and that's the evening like that's the iskcon standard evening song It's a beautiful evening Melody where they sing about Lord satanas and cry
Omaha prakash manifestation at Schriever song I'm on the banks of the ganga with a sun setting in the devotees leading sweet kirtan and then they have this phenomenon where all the demigods appear in the word for masu knable Swan Sheila appeared and they're all like choked up in love and he was singing that song and we are right in front of us even at the courthouse who wrote the song and had and who envisioned this Dome
 and we're saying I was just like oh my God we are getting taco right now we're living out this person is great Masters dream we're going to be part of his dream his vision
 magnificent occurred to me while we're out there that you know because we're floating on the ganga and we doing care time you'll just having fun just so many talented devotees you know it is beautiful just to be part of a cult
anyone can put up put it in our home owner in the front of anyone in this so many people can just be in the leader never can join in and you can experience a different flavors of devotion that each person has so we're floating around the Ganges River the ganga and then there's the other river that meets its a small River very beautiful small river that jalangi and so then they turned out I didn't know they were going to do it just as happy to let the junkie and and that's where the home of Shield about to go to Cory's right on the basket in the back of the engine like a river and it was right at that time of day that you called it the gore Authority and we also called the Sunday arthritis or RT the Arctic the Sunday like the meaning of Night and Day and Night
evening is yet but not the reading of the evening in the night of the Sun hits the Earth and who is dusk we sang that song floating on the beautiful jalangi River just right in front of Shield about Unit A House singing his song and then what I felt it such a beautiful song and it's a song that I tell him it's about the the Ecstasy that you feel
 when you chant is much worse than congregation right weight when you do this this this this yoga practice for this day just some kirtan the tear-down you know seeing together it's described that for this age of this is the most effective and Powerful you know it is the yoga practice for this age and so to do that floating on a boat in front of his home even though we're not Masters even though it won't send roses beginners at this I felt
his I felt almost like he's got this kind of sweet grandfatherly kind of presents and yeah and just the fact that we would be out there floating on a boat seeing his song in front of his home at that time just that yeah it would Grant a special blessing it was a very prolific songwriter poet
 and had
 10 children something like that but what about details like you can you can reach someone's hard just by being thoughtful and not that we really felt but just that we were there and we're seeing that then it was we got some something special blessing signal is breaking up we're going to have to do 2 minutes ago okay how's the single people nearest okay for thumbs down okay so we were on the way
we had a visit to the jungle temple right across from that was quite nice but I love that Temple I thought you spoke really well they run that you spoke about going strong attachment to Mother ganga yeah and I was mentioning their that there's something very sweet it's a it's a shack is all that should you know it externally that's all it is is Beverly Hills real estate that was right on the Congo like that but but like the building itself is just a small little love what do they call it like a shanty no buts sheet metal kind of thing and I wish a shed and then they have a simple altar with the beautiful DD of a Ganga Devi their the priests are very sweet sweet land and it is kind of like because everyone's bathing in the ganga you kind of come in there and you're in your wet bathing suit
tell me where the Mage can flip flops on no shirt that accept the temple and I've been living here for months now so when you've been going there a lot because every day every day and every day I like how they put a safety thing so you don't get dragged Away by the so hard it didn't seem that strong as a very strong that it is and but any case while I was there is always anticipate in the time when we would all come there together to screw so is it was a joy for me to be with the whole group there and die and I really appreciate how you spoke
 and I think we got to go back and I'll bathe together and go to the temple again okay will do that I will say that it was really nice as we're going to get the boat while I was like
 why are they really know how to take care of us remember who it was when you guys stick right now
that's a body burning it was it was that we saw a body burning and some people here never saw a body burn before I never saw dead body
 okay yeah but we have we hide it very well slip put away sweep it up right it's hard unless you're like an EMT or working a mortuary we're very expert at hiding bodies but we saw a body burn and roast and it really makes me look at I thought of my own body immediately I was like I'll think about some lotion I just bought for my face I was like okay what good is it I'm just going to burn one of these days I think about all the all my beauty products
 it is different
we're like even if you go to the funeral it takes time and people speak in this what you were the casket there you're not you're not sitting there for a lengthy lengthy amount of time watching
 the body of the person that was dear to gradually burn and disappear it's something about slowdowns right and then it's really is US wasn't us wasn't us and it's like the scripture Comes Alive as if they're leaving their body has a sober moment to start our little gang of pilgrimage and then I was like I'm sure they don't have life preservers on this bill that was a second thing that went through my mind
so what you going to do now we're going to talk more about what we did today or we going to read by what time to what time witches are very means of Conquest when should I be respectful obeisances to the Supreme Lord Narayan unto not around Richie the Super Bowl she was being a nurse watching the goddess of learning and she leave the house today the author not as a regular tenants in classes in the Bible Tom and by rendering service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to the heart would become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord whose praise with trays that the songs will be established as in a revocable fact
I was born a darkness of ignorance my teachers are opening my eyes with a torch out of knowledge I have Rob Base and cease to speak for the Shu mod bhagva Tom Canto 7 chapter to text 22 correct there when I get a little recap where we are and it's been awhile membrane than what it what I remember was that this would we were opening up a chapter which is this is the chapter this going to lead into the the multi-chapter telling of the story of little SRI Prasad little boy
 his conflict with his father who was like the the ultimate in kind of a demoniac figure Universal figure yeah and so before we get into that were the first thing that we're hearing about is the nature of human Akashi Pooh his father's the nature of his spot how we saw the world
what what his what was his mentality what is the demoniac mentality we need to understand we need are said to have an interview with me and it starts with his Fury is it is regarding the death of his brother that Lord Vishnu had killed his brother right who is out causing Universal destruction so so he was angry about that his family was distraught and now he's speaking to his family and the interesting thing is he speaking to them in in ways that you would expect the bra minutes to speak he speaking in ways that like he's got it right since he's got that is not a dumb dumb thinks he understands he's cultured he understands yeah he just that they don't understand read that they they they see he must be he cannot he cannot be better than me but he can ultimately cannot be better in a minute
in one sense that kind of hoping if I think you do a part of like like we grew up with like an idea of like an American idea like where I could individualism we can so we can do anything just do it and then don't eat in other words the picture that's being painted in
 did the Bucky shastra state did the bucket X like bug of agita in Mahabharata and shimabara time
 it's a very nuanced kind of message you know it's not a lie and you know when I hear especially nowadays is he's popular scientist atheist we should populate his brother, who the CEO of the signs and and we talked about this before where they they may know quite a bit about science they seem to know very little
theology so when they present their ideas against you no religion in general they seem to be only addressing the most simplistic religious conceptions sure they don't seem to address the nuanced theological conceptions but there's a very nuanced ecological conception is presented Through The Vedic literature that sang in one sense if you want to purchase a simply it's just like a just like a child is dependent on their parents the parents are providing everything for the G and they're providing it with love in their heart for the benefit of the child if you look at our thing in it and on its simple syrup is that we're saying that is our position we don't create the water that we drink we don't create the air that we breathe we don't create the food that we eat it's all provided and we're just too and if it's all being provided then doesn't it make sense to recognize that isn't the same to recognize that it wouldn't be childish or insane
not to recognize that and not to appreciate that that's that's kind of how things start but if you have the demoniac because no one is better than me then I'm going to say no. It's not being provided for me there's just a big random ball game going on right now and I'm stuck in the middle but there's not one person in this universe that I should look to to think that they are that they are what's the word I'm looking for like existentially Superior to me existentially I'm dependent on now when it gets more nuanced it goes into the nature that dependence that is actually is not a week you know in our senescence but that is part of a very beautiful relationship that even that that Supreme be even at being that all the others are dependent on
 for the purpose of Love even becomes vulnerable to those small little Souls that we are you know
yes we're dependent but we're also Eternal we're also like luminous we're we're we're also full of you know in knowledge and Bliss and even we also have the potential to possess Divine love some to call Prima which actually becomes the most powerful force that exists that we have the potential to fully manifest that so like in one century a very tiny and vulnerable in another sense we can carry the most powerful energy in the universe old is it can be presented a far more nuanced way you don't hear that they're the popular atheist addressing those kind of philosophy we've a great Paradigm how to see the world I can see I can see the tsunami of bhakti taking over the world because Times Are A-Changin my friend okay times are changin know if you are vegetarian or vegan in like 1977 or nutcase Euro tree-hugging granola recall people granolas voice
not even in the conversation no one cared and things are changing Yoga Yoga is taking over the world and I are Venusaur fuge I think we're in a massive shift where there's going to be more and there are already metaphysical scientists or people who study these multidimensional Universe etcetera I predict 20 years from now 30 years from now radically is going to be a different landscape for science than what we know it what it was I think it feel that here in my poor and dumb but just just to wrap it up and lead into a Segway into what we're about to read you know that idea and sometimes we see
 a child it went went away say child of mine and be like an adult child right like the adult child of a parent adult child in other words everyone is their parents child right as a child to their parents
like I'm an adult child that has Hang-Ups about their parents even even though the pair was nothing but caring to the to the child for their life and we see that as a flaw in the child right that they just got a messed up head that they can't even recognize the love that's being given and so that the Monarch mentalities kind of the art you know it's kind of something like that it's like I'm twisted I can accept it any was better than me I can accept a dependent on anyone I can't really supplied from the weakness we call it like rugged individualism it's like you can't handle reality like you can't handle that in one sense existentially very small and it's far more nuanced than that but there's a true person that I can't look at that I can't face that I don't want to hear that and even though he run your car she poop
father were going to hear from next on one level he's like a normal sleep powerful like just be his powers is something that you are from another perspective it's tiny and that becomes revealed so we're going to learn a bit about his mentality through this chapter hit is his animosity to the very being that is his his loving support but right now what he's speaking his kind of like it's clear knowledge Guiana like the nature of the soul and how it's going to die and how one should in the men to them 22 Spirits sold a living entity has no death for his eternal and inexhaustible I study about to get under a 22 L Chevy
go anywhere meaning to Soul anywhere in the material or spiritual worlds
 the soul is fully aware and completely different from the material body but because of being misled by misuse of his slight Independence rehab the light independent but we do have Independence he is obliged to accept subtle and gross bodies created by material energy and thus be subject to so-called material happiness and distress there for now we should limit for the passing of the spirit soul from the body isn't you know it seems to me that's the way that the thesaurus for the demons thought they recognized Carmen how it works they recognize that through austerity you could get blessings or you could or less time is a blessing I want to see who's got power and I want a mass as much of it as I can for myself and I want to do our stairs to get that I'm willing to do austerities
order to catch the attention of someone who's got power right and I have a belief that there are laws that kind of oblige them to give me power if I do so right and so they they never realize that there's a power beyond at all like like sometimes we still use that example of if you ask a child where to get your food as I myself will how in the world do you get yourself a go to the refrigerator and get it you know it's so like they don't realize that power put it there for them or what if what if there's a servant in the house that brings in their food then they think okay I get the food from the servant right but they still don't realize that the servants paid by Terence work for the very purpose of providing for that child ungrateful kids grateful kid with a buyback Corona
 don't be like ungrateful
 A continuing on because of the movements
the water the trees on the bank of the river when reflected on the water seemed to move out cuz it's the treestand still with the water's moving right when the eyes move because of mental derangement Atlanta land appears to also move okay so two two metaphors here to an LG stay in the same way when the mind is agitated by the movements of the Goon has the most material nature a living entity although freed from all different phases of subtle and gross bodies thinks that he has changed from one condition to another okay so very much third Canto almost the same thing is that they're where my where changeless
 and if I nature were Blissful then why do we feel Blissful all the time
NN. It might raise answer was if you look at the moon in the sky it steady
 how do I set you up in the sky it's not flickering or anything like that but if you look at the reflection of the moon on the water where the reflection World well well here's a point if he says if you look at the the if you look at the reflection of the moon on the water and you think that that's the moment then it seems that the Moon is taking on the nature of the water and now it's changing it's Rippling it's it's over here it's over there so simile the self the soul is changeless its Eternal but when we look to the mind or you can say the reflection of herself on the mind when we identify with the mind which is made out of matter in which is not change the switch is a matter of fact is in a constant state of change and then we feel unsteadiness and then and we don't feel a connection to our you turn out to we don't feel a connection to our knowledge we don't feel a connection to our Bliss
 and therefore we feel depressed me feel anxious we feel
it's just because we're misidentifying the mind is the self so it seems out of this was a similar type of analogy
 interested
 25 and 26 in this state the living entity accepting the body and mind to be the cell no consider some people has been and others to be Outsiders you that all the time and the tribes political parties Nations race gender gender preferences consider some people because of this misconception they suffer indeed the accumulation of such concocted with your ideas is the cause of suffering and so-called happiness in the material will the accumulation really know what is about
 it's about if we do not have faith in this idea that we're not these by
you're not even in mind that we are each one of us has a spark of spiritual energy then when we look at each other we see differences
 but if we actually have paid that no know where the spark inside were just in different Vehicles temporarily and then actually we all go through the same day from it's almost like we trade cars every day right in other words right now in your particular body and marriage like you're in the male body mirrors and female body but if you knew that like next life that might switch then you don't identify so much as a man and she doesn't identify so much as a woman you have the right to a car it's not you it's not your thing go get proud of it and don't be embarrassed by it right not your car and so what this is saying is that because we focus because we lack the spiritual inside the conviction that I am Spirit not not matter I'm not these this body or even this mind the eye and you are these Sparks a spear
because we lack that conviction we focus on differences in because we focus on the differences and I like the way that it that it said it it says there's an accumulation of such concocted material ideas is the cause of suffering in the world right now so there's no differences in skin color race Nation religion we just randomly drew a line and now these guys are my enemies and their side against other Bloodlines OST stage where they must have birth in different species and work in various types of consciousness
 that's creating new bodies
 interesting yeah it's like me she's a horse just like thinking about horse things all day looking around
here they come to ride me again where is the water going to take a nap you know just like the worst crocodile dolphin whatever you know they have different lenses different ears nose very interesting species money how much money I'm going to get money more money and have them happy I'll be thinking like this Anna me centered and he said that guy every conversation you bring up your enemy so whatever it whatever that mine is trained to hate or love
 you become a victim ubik you follow it like like a slave it is like a figure eight sometimes you just can't get out in your whole lifetime you can't get out unless you need someone who can say hey you're not the mind,
you're not the body you're not the mind you're not from this culture you're not an American you're a you're not even a human kid your spirit soul
 spare Souls lives matter
 okay continue the condition sold us to condition sold us situated must take birth in different species and work in various types of Consciousness that's creating new bodies this continued with your life is called samsara Sanskrit word for the day right some Sarah went somewhere that's right you know said it might be a devotee but let's just say they had to take birth again so that's that energy that Force animates the body
somewhere according to their activities or desire their meditation become qualified to get a different type of body yeah you're working towards it right now your thoughts and your meditation are creating you and we're always meditating we're always meditating on something
 spent it on this precipice birth birth birth death lamentation. And anxiety are due to such material considerations thus we sometimes come to proper understanding and sometimes fall again to a wrong conception of light bobbing up and down
 and if sample is given an old history the friends of a dead person
for spilling play me God if there is a God why does make people suffer. Doesn't does that's his job is just given what you've been asking for you want to do that you got to do and then you can pick what you want to do that you can do that you could do you have this limited free will to do whatever you want but you gotta understand there's some payback for that can can't just like run a drug cartel expect you know they'll be vicious murderers go on paid for no one gets away with murder no one gets away with murder there's always some price you got to pay even if it's with living with a murderous unless you're a sociopath is filled with things with anxiety all the time you know and then we found out it would be found out and I've never done anything like that if I was to murder not in this life perhaps but
I couldn't go out downtown Danbury Connecticut and shoplift did you left a little bit I could do it I just can't steal downloaded some cool like a little things like the ice cream sandwiches things like that started going to build a talk with no Xbox is really my thing I still books in the library bookstore but then I don't know if the library's even exist anymore and yes it's okay okay all right let's get back in this room
 okay in the state
known as Lucy Nara there was a subdued and he's telling an allegory for the celebrated King named so Yaya when the King was killed in battle by his enemies his Kinsmen set down around the dead body and began to Lament The Death of their dear friend is golden Bejeweled armor smashed took pride in it and put on that armor how do you feel about very powerful and he was gold and it wasn't like cheap know he was an opulent powerful than a make right is golden be mad I was on the football team for short time and then you put on that big shoulder pads and helmet and all during the day around the game really cool well I was second string tackle but
but the last day before the big game the crosstown Rivals the first string broke into the school and stole a bunch of like milks like you said you'd milks and then I'll stuff in school and they all got suspended and I got to start start for the final game was a highlight of my life was one of the greater takes up my life I received as it was on kickoff receiving to be I got clobbered with a special team is the most dangerous it was day before that was illegal football outfits golden armor Bejeweled armor smashed his ornaments in Garland Bale Garland on falling from their places his scattered hair and his eyes lusterless
the slain King land the battlefield his entire body smeared with blood is heart pierced by the arrows of the enemy is happening all the time happen in Forever when he died he had wanted to show his prowess
 and plus he had bitten his lips
 and his teeth remained in that position or what do you mean what's that mean like like this is what I want to look like when I'm dead, I think he was just like it was an expression of like his battle expression battle expression sure and then he died with that expression on his face it's kind of you know what it's telling when he died his lips his teeth remained and you can still see even though he's dead
I said he was in when he yeah it's all good place is beautiful Lotus like face was that I'm black and covered with dust from the battlefield his arms with his sword and other weapons were cut and broken queens of the king of Sushi Nara saw their husband lying in that position they began crying
 now that you have been killed and killed repeating these words again and again it fell down pounding their bosoms and the feet of their dead and feet of their dead King so this is a pitiful as sad as it happens all the time spent as the Queen's loudly cry their tears glided down their breasts becoming reddenwood by the kum-kum powder and fell upon a load of speed of their husband
 their hair became disarray and their ornaments fell in a way that evoke sympathy from the hearts of others the queen
your husband's death
 oh Lord you have now been removed by cruel Providence to a state beyond our vision is to stay in the livelihood of the inhabitants Lucy Nara and us they were happy but your condition now is the cause of their unhappiness for scary huh it can goes down like that it's like I have everything becomes unstable now women the cattle get stolen the men are murdered the children slaves were just guys just go on without him here some extra money for you to rebuild now
 slaves you just become a slave that happens
 okay no hero you are very grateful husband and the most sincere
all of us house we exist without you all here or wherever you were going please direct us so that we may follow in your footsteps and engaged again and you're loving service let us go alone with you along with along with you to this is the mood of a loving spouse or like okay you went to some higher Planet I'm going with you burn up the fire make it big I'm jumping in there with you because there's nothing left back here now man ya laddies how many people do that there for their husband all right for you right now I think it's like the most romantic thing even though it sounds horrific is sorta like wow. I don't want to live
 is that codependent
 write a song about that one
 that's not exactly
yes, I was thinking about
 Jeff Eisenberg get on that right out of it right now and it was appropriate for the body to be burned it about this but the Queen's not allowing it to be taken away continue lamenting for the dead body which they kept on their laps in the meantime this time completed its movements for the setting in the west it's it's interesting right cuz here here they are they're holding on to that everybody
 but the soul is gone they know deep down the source says that the person is gone but they identified the body with the person so deeply that they can let go to the body sure and I think they can't let it go so they're in a state of Illusion it's very emotional state that they're not obviously but it's at again it's a pitiful State and when I say pitiful I don't
don't mean that like an integrating way but beautiful in the sense that
 it's you have to feel pity for someone who's in ignorance and we're all kind of like existing to some degree or another in that ignorance without understanding the eternality of the Soul there's either that that was his pitiful pitiful existence or there's like this stoicism which is almost like a heartless existence
 when it means okay out here while the Queen's for the dead body assuming the body of a boy yamraaj personally approached the relatives of the dead body of Ben buys him his father why did he come as an interesting he was a little boy
little boy said how amazing it is these persons were older than
 what's up
 I'm taking birth and died right bichoo Aries every day there's a bituary sandpaper the condition Soul comes from Gus they should understand that they are also opt to die it's still there bewildered write the condition Soul comes from an unknown place and returns after death to that same unknown place there is no exception to this rule which is conducted by material nature knowing this why do they use us Lila meant that's a little boy says that when your husband dies your wife. See how they respond it it is wonderful that these elderly women do not have a higher sense of life than we do indeed we are most fortunate for although we are children and haven't left to struggle and it's your life
protected by father and mother and we are very weak we have not been vanquished or eaten by a brooches animals that can happen
 that's where the firm belief that the Supreme person out of godhead who has given us protection even in the womb of our mother will protect us everywhere okay so there's a message here this is Young Mirage still talking again it's interesting that this is coming from her any cash you feel because it's what it seems to be saying is we tend to think that there are material circumstances that provide us protection really they're all fallible they're all doomed they're all have a at the you know a certain scope of time he just get braces if he didn't directly I don't think it didn't intentionally okay you know but but it is what yamaraja say
 is that all along we're being protected
right all along we're being protected if he understands exactly what's happening and that protection is coming from a still higher source it's not that that King that husband that is really giving the troop attack sure cuz they're very fallible David that any momentary about something there's something far greater there's something far more stable that one can connect with
 are we out of time yeah kinda almost okay so we'll go pick back up here tomorrow then
