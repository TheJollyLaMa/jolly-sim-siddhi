what are you doing Washington d.c. my husband was already living in DC and as a teenager I always had the question about what's the purpose of life and everybody said oh that's really a deep question you shouldn't really be asking these buses for later but the other question kind of stayed back of my mind and yeah and then I went to the DC Temple's first time it was just such a heart-touching experience it's not that not been to other temples before but it was just such a heart-touching experience for both of us and we thought we should explore explore wasn't into it either now he wasn't into it so well is really like love at first sight until you both fell in love with Christian at the same time or your parents religious
did she know traditional family anything particular, but not that sometimes it's there. But they don't necessarily have like a strong spiritual path necessarily and a couple nice people like you listen to his messages getting shot I really started in 1998 so it's been a good twenty-five years since we started practicing Krishna Consciousness okay I came across was the most they just couple years ago but I started listening to more regularly maybe in the last year or year-and-a-half and I guess so much for me you know just
 yeah both of you are just amazing and very insightful and
 just like the one
ability that you're bringing into the show you know that she don't find out there so much you know and it's just as well as helps if it helps to be a train wreck when you're always derailed thank you so much it means a lot to me that
 I'm a physician golf raining I'm a pediatrician but I quit work about 10 years ago the lower 10 years ago I've had some complicated spine surgeries and stuff just can't be on my feet all day

You can wear the names thank you so much the waves of
 August UVA PPL
number one what's the number one that's good is Cupid a day you're listening to this on face on Facebook do this they're not forget it if you're alright this is a question from Graham via email
 I've been an avid other for a little over a year now can't thank you enough for the beautiful gift that wisdom of the of wisdom of the sages I listened almost every day and have been catching up on old episodes while I work sometimes listening for six or seven hours at a time we need to talk it out toll booth six or seven hours like I tell your employer
oh that's great okay that's very good my life over the past 10 years has been an up-and-down of spiritual seeking and struggling to cope with the world I was born into yeah I am so fortunate to have friends and family that I do but it has been hard to find a spiritual community that really resonates with who I am becoming your podcast is laid the groundwork for Spiritual path I can finally route into I found your show through my interest in Native American studies and see connection between Native American spirituality and Hindu spirituality I found episode 179 in my search and have been hooked ever since
 parallels between Native American spirituality in in the bag was on your ability to speak such deep profound truth and a concise and
relatable matter lets you has been bubbling has been a bubbling spring has been a bubbling spring in the middle of a desert I recently joined the sage Group which I'm so blessed by I made beautiful friendships and feel like I have so much more inspiration in my life that's great that's great thank you again and I hope to join the morning Zoom soon this G right now so my question is about the difference between shaivism the worst was Sheba and vaishnavism shaivism
 like shaving the faces I said that wrong and I understand I understand that babe praise either Sheba or Vishnu but I'm curious if there's a contradictory literature that propounds a Shiba is the Supreme Lord
as opposed to Bishop or if there's some kind of interpretation that either side makes to put their chosen DD for the Supreme
 does either DD acknowledge the other do they encounter one another I know I could Google a lot of this but I'm curious to hear from the bhakti perspective thank you again for your beautiful work
 they don't even acknowledge each other anymore I'm not reading this passed out during the ride I'm going to share that on the right when you got for this question but we can talk easily this won't show on this one question I mean
 so the so essentially the question is here to deities you know
I remember reading in on
 in in Devon Bryant's yoga sutras where he did so much really excellent research and you know he he did a lot of research into the term each one in the in the yoga sutras imagine C sharp right on to this is a valid practice of you over to surrender yourself unto each quarter Supreme controller literally at the Supreme controller in and he is so he did Research into all kinds of ancient texts and because when you pick up when you pick up a book on by Ahmad until the teacher a lot of times and they going to touch down the yoga explaining it and a lot of times it's just explain it however they want explain they haven't done that kind of reach the right they they may not be in touch with the tradition and so will you sure can mean you know and then I'll just... Celibacy means
yourself you can me and you would like him to me I like a hamsa hamsa never hear this one amps means
 because you're so kind to yourself and never any heard any ashram say that so he did a lot of research into the term East flora and what he found was really there to DD's that are called each for and that would be Shiva and Vishnu or you don't have course Krishna is all the divisional incarnations are as we see them all the Vishnu Krishna and carnations are called each one of them and so
 this question the way that we would approach this question is that you would look into places especially because this is that this is the one thing that if you approach
 Indian spirituality and when I say Indian I mean the writings of yesterday that the The Vedas the the
they'll punish Assad's the Mahabharata the Epic Mahabharata and the piranha switch stream the Box on this one if you if you just approach that just just come to it it seems like a lot of contradictory things are being said all over the place it's really hard to wrap your something you have just one book in the book is really tightly focused it's his vast amount of literature and a vast amount of ideas and something that may be really foreign to to Western thinkers is that
 it's not let you know and I don't I'm not when I say this I'm not even trying to say that I even understand exactly where Christianity goes with this Bud like you read I think from the Old Testament like I'm a jealous God right and if you worship other you know then you know you're in trouble when you get over here
it's not like that yeah it's not it's like like Krishna in the bug of agita say he'll say however it is
 San Jose
 find it
 he says
 he says he's
 let us take one step back one more step back I think that Western people that come to Eastern thought a large part of why they do it is because of a certain disappointment or frustration with or trauma okay. Is there the presentation that they received of cortical Western religion which is really Middle Eastern
religion is that we're right and everybody else is wrong and there's some wisdom within them there's some truth within them that that just does not resonate with this can't be truly spiritual if it has such a narrow such a such a narrow way of understanding if you can recognize genuine spirituality genuine goodness in people from all tradition I can't get my heart too and I can't I can't accept it and so then they swing over to the Eastern which is wide open over here that was a loser so the pendulum swings from like we're right everybody's wrong to everybody's right this is so good and everybody's writing anything. And that's really not
 that's really not the the synthesis of either there's a synthesis of these two
points I'm still a loser you're saying but the synthesis is is that there's what what the these beta text show is that there's a belated in so many different viewpoints or face or Traditions they're not invalid they're good they're beautiful they're helpful
 but they do kind of like evolve in a pattern like they've all they they they climb a ladder up to you know complete Transcendence and so when you look at all of that bass Indian literature is All The Vedic literature
 there's there's so many different presentations there was a question that Grandma's he said is there a how did he phrase it like a contradictory literature out there already said opposed you know to do that that's saying that
 he said
is there some kind of contradictory leadership I'm curious is there a contradictory literature that propounds that she was a supreme Lord as opposed to Vishnu
 yes there is and it's written by the same author
 you will walk away with the impression that she was the Supreme because you just glorifying him like crazy at the same time in the ship a piranha is going to expand its it's landed in with a lot of Headway to vedanta idea so it's it's I kind of like bhakti blended with ideas would wait to lay down too so it's kind of like she was Greg give your heart to see but give your sold if you could give you a hand at the same time you are Shiva and I like are we are all Shiva and it is so it's it's Baga Thomasville different now we would say that these are literature that involving up to the presentation of all the time now a Shy Boy
I don't know they're evolving up to the to look at what we would have what is the person that we're going to get this settled by right as we can say the same author of both so we need to go to that or after to find out exactly and that's why I say what is that you say Woody Allen film you know who's in line for filming and I get some avant-garde film and some guy behind him is like interpreting it in some way he steps out of himself or he talks to guy doesn't understand it at all. They misinterpreted the whole thing and then I'll his is girlfriend a senior calm down you know it's okay and it keeps going on is getting more frustrated and she's saying take it easy and said that I can't take anymore
 and then he steps out of the frame know first thing it does is it goes out to the guy says you misunderstand the whole thing you know you don't you don't understand it at all the guys like while I happen to be
HD Indian this very Riders works and you know and so then he says okay 1 second he steps out of the frame and comes back in and has the actual ride and the writer looks at the other guys that you don't understand anything that I was trying to say you're completely misunderstood it and so in a sense we can do that has biasa Dave say no no no what we have is in the streaming box, self both are works of his own okay but he is explaining himself and his method in the bar with time and he does that through the story where he's he's he's written all of these texts I'm still feeling despondent something's missing something not right he doesn't quite understand why and then is grunauer to comes to him explain exactly why you just fun because you've done you've done so you've shared so much you know why you've done so much good work for Mankind through through your literature
 and any mansions and even the Mahabharata by the end of it which has the bug of agita and which is pointing towards Krishna bhakti
he says even nicer but you have not been very fully explicit and an explaining bhakti as the full Evolution and explaining Krishna bhakti is it complete know the complete Evolution the South that there's one route to all existence and you haven't fully spoken to that so now that's what you need to do so then it's all good he explains that he went back to revise the sugar block of time and you made it it's very explicitly clear and you know beginning from the very from the very outset with almond amore part of a table setting by its location then the verse is a file that are very explicit this book is not going to speak on any of those other lower lower levels this is the cream of The Vedic literature future and it if you took it and kept turning into turning into turning it until you got its very essence that's this bottle with time and the bog time clearly without any ambiguity
 makes it very clear that Christian is
root of all this existence he is the many times you like hear the word division Rock mother the the soul of the universe you know that the root of of everything you know and of course he's fully glorified it and it is past time to give in there for the purpose of our meditation and the 10th can't tell which is huge cancel the other is life so it doesn't say anything like that if we go to the bug of agita so these are real two sources like how is it approaching the bug with you because the bug of agita is very much like like taking the entire upanishads in explaining it in one conversation for something cool. Opana show up because you get the essence of the Upon a Child in it and they are Christians very explicit in there he'll say and then I'll read now you said I wanted to say that before I got into this because because this stuff sounds heavy when
but he says those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires what is commoditized hair healthy again that that's, their desire for it again and stolen their if the clarity division or not he send those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires they surrendering to the demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own nature they said she was not a demigod what we can get there in a moment ago I'm just I'm really using this to illustrate I mean of course he is called like the Haitian like the decision but the reason why I'm sharing this to show how this isn't like worship any other God and your city or something like that it's like cuz this is what I said although he did say it has to be until you know we say some of that it sounds like a big
I've been covered by their desires it's let's just short so so then he says I'm in the heart I mean everyone's heart as a Super Soul For Mama and as soon as one desire to worship some demigod or city I burn down their homes and their wife and he says is his I make their faith steady I make their face Teddy so that they can devote themselves to that particular deity endowed with such Faith the Endeavor to worship the particular a demigod in a container desires so he said that'll be good for them if they're not ready to say I'm coming to Krishna and I and I want nothing but love
 if they want something of this world they seem better that they worship Shiva for that and that they just go bad without recognising okay squirrel yes
if you need it like a Jehovah Witness on the street of a knock on your door a Mormon or a or Christian or just like get into it with them or do you just like you know they made their determination to invest their faith in their particular deity so let so be it do you get in with do you get into it or you just let them be in peace well I don't have a problem conversing and sharing but I'm not going to I'm definitely not going to get like invest my energy and trying to swing them if they're opposed to it you know that I'm happy to share what I'm into or hear what they're into but I'm not going to sit there and wrestle with him to try to see who's going to win
 Nina
 what about you I don't know I don't I don't know if I say I love Jesus and then I'm going to ask the question the most attractive being and they'll be like oh yes of course I'll you trade you worship
you believe that God is in the whole world
 ice I start off by saying I am Christian
 Christ was here now you'd like me and why don't you follow what he says I do I do I do I do I wear robes just like him don't think I could borrow your works okay so that was one point that is very broad you know that and that Christmas saying that he would write that he would have Inspire vyas to write a book like that Shiva piranhas and encourage people to recognize shiver as Supreme because it's a viable step forward
 but then you keep going forward until he reveals you fully that okay now you want now you're ready to go still further let me explain to you was still frozen in the bottom is explicit you don't hear that the ship run is the cream of the basic literature hear that the Bob what time is it it's when it's been
turn it all the way until you get right to the very thick creamy essence of it all and that's where we hear that Christian is that there's that root of all existence in a but you mentioned but what if someone says that that she was not like an ordinary demigod. She's a butt and we agree and it said that to understand
 Shiba Inus what would she is at a nudist a top-four should a toddler to understand what what is Shiva is very subtle and difficult thing to understand is that beautiful analogy what milk is to Yogurt Vishnu is Toshiba milk in yogurt the same thing and they're the completely not the same thing at the same time one cools the body when he eats the body once I sort of solid ones pure liquid but it's the same thing also I have the verse for the promise to meet
just as milk is transformed into curd now I'm thinking like Brahma
 by the action of acids
 and but yet the effect of crude is not of the same nor different from his cause name with milk
 so I adore the Primeval Lord Govinda of whom the state of shambu which refers to ship it is the transformation of the performance is it is is a transformation a transformation of Krishna
 for the for the performance of the work of Destruction cuz she would destroy as the union rights to the Cycles he sees the destroyer in the commentary should have bought you sit on his arse mighty taco rice so shampoo or Shiba cannot be called the Geva the most of those debt demigods who said they're like us they take on the role was a demigod then they're out of that roll you know eventually met
is there a long time but they're essentially like us you can't is so he says so Shambo Shiva cannot be called the Geva he is the lord of the Geneva but yet partakes of the nature of a separated portion of Govinda so he's like Krishna transformed with a touch just like you put a little you put lemon lemon and too independent to the milk to get curd a little acid in there and then you and then in this the same milk takes on a different shape so by Mansions three things it's a little subtle in the commentary three things what you could say I sent you is a touch of the material energy that that's Krishna transforms into Shiva and the ship within our tradition isn't looking looked at his competitor we say bison of an omni Itachi anbu we see him as as a transformation Christian but also as a great devotee of Krishna
can Bobbie Thomas Fuller glorification where she let you know his personal protecting you so we hear from popular protecting I told the store yesterday of Lord Shiva
 wanted to go see Krishna in in cuz we did our program over in
 NG Shiva came to the house of Krishna imagine, not someone's knocking on your door and you open the door in a man's got like a snake around his neck and he's got his head and wild dreads he's got water somehow magically dripping from his head necklace of skulls he goes to the crematorium where they burn the bodies and smear the ashes of the bodies on his body every time I was a car once and bring the oven is a squirrel with a squirrel
 bother you Mona River and I'm just here like talking to somebody and there is a snog Ababa right behind me is she the worst ever he started
wearing a chain around his belt and a COPE in like a g-string and he's covered in White Ash has dark skin and white ashes and I turn around and screen brightness
 intimidated and scared why you open the door and get away from me or get away from here you scare my child and pollute my child close the door right on Shiva and when she was at the baby started crying and crying and crying and all the household attendees try to cheer him up,
continue to cry and then all the ladies of the household said maybe it was that saw two who came maybe Chris maybe little crystal wants to see that saw two so what they did was after that side of the chest she had a running back please come back please go back to Lady of the house wants to see you and when they open that door so he said our child won't stop crying child won't stop in as soon as baby cuz she was face he started giggling and laughing and smiling and Emily should have said, will you please stay here please don't go anywhere he's just reside here and he said under two conditions
 whenever you bathe this baby boy you give me some of that water yeah that's the trying to Rita he said whenever you feed that little baby whatever to me so this is the deal with the little ball Shiba
I got to read those pastimes a modern rendition but make me have seen pictures of
 okay that was my story as best we could and then you know when a relatively short amount of time we don't know what we can get know everything we know we doing are we just have to go to this text. Then that's how hard I'm not there this probably fun to be a shaivite to yeah but we know but we know okay thank you I don't know
I know Krishna
 do you know Krishna Hare Krishna then you would know
 oh yeah and I want to be your base I don't want I don't want to fear based relationship with God I have that as a child and I want to go back there I want sweet baby Christmas my Lord I think he wants you good
 okay what's next on our agenda, we have a question from bosma last month
 I know but we do need your rocking and what if it means deer Rock enough and YouTube
those other guys is good Mara I love you and benefiting and learning a lot as well as enjoying listening to it great thank you for your great work and efforts
 my question is about praying for others should we pray for others when they haven't asked us to do so
 that's like something that I can base of yeah your privacy violating someone yeah like I had your chart done and I get a project for you I hope you're okay with that but have your charger and it didn't look good for you so I had this whole food is done for you you should be feeling it in about a week but others when they didn't ask when they haven't asked us to do so say someone or the world is in distress is it
that we pray for them or is that us try to exert our will control agenda perhaps over the situation and not trusting Christians plan
 is it best to just leave the whole thing to Krishna and trust that he is in control and knows better than us what's best for the situation and what's needed I like this question
 cuz the way she described both I flip-flopped on improving ourselves and only pray for those who asked us thank you very much
 this is much needed advice or much-needed can you give give me some advice on this one I'm always praying for my kids should I just wait my kids you're on your own
 you're not mine I don't own you
 God loves you good luck out there
free crane maybe the Russians are pay for the innocent Crystal L and it would do well I look at the bar with time and I see it's kind of like a big collection of prayers to all those stories but the stories always kind of open up into the prayer and that's where were meant to live the mood prayer that's most beneficial you know and see what kind of person but what you don't see is people praying for material things of this world and what you don't see is people praying or freedom from the you-know-what to scape this world into find some kind of peace or something like that you to see people praying for others to do the praying for like material things like tell me what the should she not pray for like I hope you pass the exam hope my Sun Passes the exam I hope he gets a good wife I hope it I don't find prayers like that involved with him so why not pray for them but pray that what can I say
prayer is simple I pray for their simple one connection I pray for my enemies deep connection I pray for my friends deep connection I've ever make it a perfect guy was on his deathbed not to get better and not to die whatever God I pray that I will be done but I pray for their souls deep connection with a liver die Paradise from the second u.s. history of the son of hiranyakashipu paralogue 18 chapter 10.
 Neither Be Good Fortune throughout the universe may all envious but all hostile persons be pacified may all living entities become Kong
sympathy yoga
 and by accepting devotional service they will think of each other's welfare therefore let us all engage in the service of the Supreme Transcendence or SRI Krishna and always remain in sword and thought of him so that's a prayer for others you know but it's not a prayer I hope he passes right home and then maybe be connected may we be uplifted made may we all begin to mate may the true nature within us the true spiritual nature the true spiritual energy that is krishna's energy they may rise in US memorize a meeting a Verizon everyone else but you think about like a college team praying for their football team to win where does that go all definitely well outside the borders and it's got some place in the Vatican Pantheon of we're talkin about
the alliance he was just saying that like I'm sorry but I just can't see the same Peter in and the Baptist guess somehow like American football it's like somehow tied into religion like the praying for their team and there it is I think it's not just American football I think you go to Brazil
 I think it has to do with their karma
 not all you're saying, is Pat more powerful than God that's not our Naza saying that God has got his has relegated those kind of prayers within the realm of car more than God is a step in and make a team win absolutely okay just checking at any moment
yeah that and that's it maybe you'll get that but you won't get what you want get love I just like saying yeah that's like saying go to a billionaire and ask for a nickel okay I got you one more question
 take a deep breath deep breath before I heard on the news that somebody found it can't digging and garden they found a can of gold coins in perfect mint condition in the backyard and because there's a numismatist value of one of them was worth $1000000 they found five other cans now is my desire to find treasure materialistic or is it just like I love adventure and it's a good thing I will not judge
you know what I mean cuz it's real
 like you're like doing demo and your house and behind the wall or something come on lock my friend what happens is from Saraswati a regular Zoomer Illinois
 what happens to the soul when we die
 the body dies or what advice do you give families or me and the hospice nurse okay hospice nurse is serious to teach families and or patients to help them leave their body how can I explain while not causing harm to their religion of us is always giving the right amount of medicine right you don't give anything they may not get better and they may know
believe their grief if you give too much are like get out of here while you telling me this and trying to go against tradition that I exactly why do you ask rights that literature in exactly that way and that Broadway because not everybody can be ready to go straight to the bar but I'm sure sure it's a very very is probably reason why star Swati like just got so serious like she is ever since we met her this summer last summer and she just says listen to buy was on every day now and I think when you're dealing with these people that deal with death and tragedy and Trauma on a regular basis it's like they have a little you know the rest of the world like me is living in a loser like it's beautiful like the beautiful flowers Hospital yes you're right it's been you do this check up in the hospital is just like it's broken dreams you see people
build in there that you know they got that thing on the wrists that's so they can just plug in the feeding tube oh yeah you said they got their rolled on and going through it through it and screaming sometimes Lust For Life for the children's Ward it's one like sober I don't see a sick child I never see a sick child but if you're working in that so you can see people day when you take a child to see the parents parents are in grief be in there and out of there they do have a one up but you're like yeah but you got to be able to deal with it and not but a break you you know but anyway
 what you just said
right now is the answer to her question it reminds me of an answered that it was almost exactly a year ago I think it was December 31st last year because I was here and I remember we did two shows one on the 31st and one on the 1st and in both of those shows is he some it was Kelly Becker that asked a question it was meaningful and in Kelly Becker ask that question like she works in those kind of wards and she was saying how do I not put in there was a patient that just woke up in the hospital couldn't speak couldn't
 maybe even here it was like they're just kind of like they just woke up and it works out their senses in a hospital not knowing anyone in and I don't think I think it seemed like they couldn't identify who it was so they're just kind of like taken from the world and dropped in the hospital
can you communicate and she was doing whatever she could in her power to to give some sense of relief or something to eat and at the same time it was for her it was becoming a bit overwhelmed it was kind of like she was living with it all day everyday and if it was so she was asking how do you how did you phrase it not not let it take over your life and I'll break you break it and so then we reached out to three different people OK Google shop kutikula pradeep who's a hospital chaplain oh yeah we reached out to Dona who's like a counselor relationship counselor and we reached out to garnish a a hospital chaplain and we got wonderful answers from them but we're going to Sean Road it as a letter and it was so insightful that the next day we took it and we read it again and you got it I got it I do I have parts of it. What you got a particularly relevant to this question because so this question is okay she's she's working in the hospital how did she look with how did she describe
she said I would happen to the soul we die or what advice to give families she said General is so this is what he said about cuz she opened it up saying what do we what happens when the soul dies I think it's kind of what we tell them right do we tell them that you were going to live forever or what advice do we give families to teach families or patience to help them leave their body how can I explain while not causing harm to their religion and so he gave this advice about how to really try to help someone in that state
 answer this what he says he says rather than in this I think this even goes back to the previous question of it to about prayer he says rather than a general set prayer
 for people who are suffering
like we could just sit down with every person to say the same Father prayer prayer for people who are suffering if we can pray
 from what we've learned and he he's going to drop just like a thing that I think just relates to and that's why we did do the next show because it relates to all types of relationships and all kind of circumstance if we can re from what we've learned to be the essence of their need essence of the need what is it that they really need what is it that they're missing because of missing it they're suffering if we can pray from what we learned to be the essence of their need with all the personal details
 about what they're going through who they are
 then by this dip their their most most often deeply touched by these kind of prayers
 it requires we listen to them while asking the questions to ourselves
eternally and these are the three questions when it says control now I'm listening but this is what I'm looking for when I'm listening I'm listening for what is the essence of their need right now what is happening behind their words cuz they may not even be able to fully Express what they're going through what they need but what is happening behind their words and what is most important to them right now to what is the essence of their need right now what is happening behind their words what is most important to them right now once we've identified the heart of their suffering
 in the heart of their need we can sincerely pray using this understanding in our prayer
 okay I'm sitting here I'm holding the hand of someone and you do for them you know what's what what's a really experiencing is a deep sense of loneliness or deeds and what whatever it is
people are often stunned
 that they've been understood so deeply
 and they can feel a healing gratitude to be seen and heard so well so just to be understood is healing to be seen in her to a major part of the suffering is the feeling of loneliness and isolation that accompanies the physical challenges but if our words and our prayers you know so like on a superficial level you say oh my God this person has a broken leg in there to have these tubes in them and could God may they be relief from this you know soon as we're really not getting to the essence of their need okay so you could continue but it forward a major part of the suffering is the feeling of loneliness and isolation that accompanies the physical challenges but if our words and our prayers display a true understanding of their pain and knee
it may help to heal things a little and bring back faith and trust in goodness love meaning they may have lost touch with ie faith in God
 so this is what he going to do this this is kind of how he works using these guidelines and I think that that Sarah could could gain from them you know we don't necessarily it's not necessarily our Forte are duty to kind of bring them to the deepest understanding now right but it's our it's our duty to help relieve their suffering or and ideally through truth not through illusion so which will take them a step or two steps for me whatever it is you don't lead with their are Cowherd girls take it back a little bit and you are one of them are about to find out very soon
alright talk to you in the right place hearing hearing about what time here in the back up again on a regular basis will also assist you in doing what you're doing without sharing this with people to get better at doing it by doing it it's not true you know what I showed up on Christmas Eve wearing orange robes at my Italian Catholic families house and just tell my mom she's not my mom that what that didn't work well I didn't go over well I learned from that not to not to use that approach any longer so we need a we learn sometimes by trial-and-error okay it doesn't work going strong let's try delicate at then they go the other way sometimes they don't say anything and that's not good either so you got to give a little but
 the real magic happens when they ask you what what do you believe that's what I find my chefs and then you say well
true but there's a there's more I can tell you is mysterious mystical things
