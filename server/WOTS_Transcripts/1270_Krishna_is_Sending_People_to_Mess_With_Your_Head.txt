 okay yeah me and ER
 Meander that the one funny thing about right now that it's going to be an enduring into just random temples yeah
a specific temples and Brandon temples cuz there's always just there's always some undiscovered Temple you know what a good thing to do is have you been to the shroom
 I think a long time okay it's great and is it's a great job for a walk to you go down the trail to come unlock the program the pricker Marg where you take a right at the baraja got to take a left take a left and he just keep walking that road and it gets really real and beautiful do that for getting the boat at the emunah and going to Lakshmi Bon Secour in a whole nother World get on a boat across the river and go to Lakshmi long and I have a lot of time here is mostly what I want to do a diving cuz there's a couple things I want to chance it with the devotees in the Cure time in the evenings and the temple
 yeah and
attend Mangal aarti would like to do that
 and cuz you know so many memories of Dad huh yeah it was beautiful ladies in the world I mean you know it is beautiful and your crystal ball the wrong she she ran out of sham Sunder Mongol RT's in the morning cure tons of the evenings then I want to go to the the temples and the somalis of the goswami is especially I want to go to my grandma Hannah Temple I want to pray to Saint on goswami want to go to write it down or tell if I want to pray to Rupa and jeeva did this I like what you're saying makes hosts the other means so much to me and I'm writing and they're there they are the very source of all of our teachings and our son for diarrhea and the great writers in the great communicators about 2 so I want to stick their Their Blessings so that's how we want to give you a little inside if you'd like
princess Amalia and pray for downloads of the secret samadhi to the Somali that the world's not ready for that has all the secret literature is entombed so should I just like to roll around it but your forehead to it and you say please enter my heart like you did perogative let's see what the somebody gives back to you say you got it all inside you said no secret secret they were these are great so esoteric where these texts that they said nobody could nobody's really ready for these we need to put them in the somebody put them in the Tomb yeah
 that's why they are what are they about I know but the problems they see we're going out that you think I want to see but my inclinations that if I did I wouldn't be able to understand them
 I wouldn't be able to have to pray for the understanding
what is you don't have to have the books out of the samadhi for then you can just get the understanding without them anyway all right what's going on today
 we got back to Recovery Group meetings online going on at 1 to 9 p.m. eastern time and in-person meetings in Maya pour this evening and tomorrow she'll be the same time so 7 a.m. eastern time in New York
 live meetings all right you ready we got to start a new chapter today
 hi this is from your friend of mine Steve Jobs is a job's Steve Jobs at the Leafs have it was jokes they're all laughing
oops jobs they're all laughing at me
 it's a job's all these years I think everybody knows who he is although apparently not everybody knows how to pronounce his name yeah that's so this is what he says just kick people don't know who is he living he's the founder of Apple computers and founder I guess who's the CEO until he passed away right yeah
 yeah supposedly what is a young man he traveled around India was raw foodist to know that I do know this was in college he used to go to the Christian it's local Krishna Temple in California I think I thought was Gainesville FL maybe even spoke about and said you know they really you know you're a lifesaver
sorry sell he says read this read a nice sweet and nice to see now what he say Apple Computers it means something more spent are in a raw foodist
 okay
 that's been one of my mantras focus and simplicity focus and simplicity that's the muncher simple can be harder than complex yeah you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple but it's worth it in the end because once you get there you can move mountains weight statement well this is what you know sutras are all about their codified little nuggets little nuggets of truth that you can expand upon so simple
 focus and simplicity
 say a few words
you want to speak volumes you know when someone really knows something and I am always impressed about devotees of Krishna is because there is a philosophy and the philosophy can be capsulated pretty simple always remember Krishna never forget Krishna it's because they will give you volumes and volumes and volumes will never quite understand it because they themselves don't understand it it takes a person to really understand something to really simplify it
 no doubt and that can't be done if when your mind is just cluttered so he's saying you have to work hard to get here this is a term use your get your thinking clean
 I got you thinking clean so I'm at the store yet lose it thought clear Lucid thoughts so that you can want for make good decision making
N24 deeper perception into reality you know to see beyond what most people see to understand more was having a strong focus and simplicity you know the Simplicity is everything helps the focus is all in the mind Focus getting and he's saying very rightfully that when you get there you can move mountains and in one sense the mountains that we need to move our internal mountains you know like we have mountains of attachments mountains of petty grievances grievances mountains of identifications and misperceptions of what we need to be happy or who he even our mountains to move in and they've been settled down and it in our in our awareness for lifetimes Simplicity is one of those basic fundamental yogic principles and he says it could be harder than come
because everywhere we turn specially in today's society I'm it was hard enough back in and go back before advertising and you know what you speak of Television movies internet you know all of that everywhere we turned our something telling us you would be happier if you just got this you would be happier if you just did this and every time you say yeah that does look like it'll bring some happiness the tricky thing is is that it almost always kind that it's very simple
 it comes with strings attached to comes you know you got to work harder to get it or once you do it you there's a cost to go to cost in terms of your health across in terms of your time a cost in terms of the programming within your mind the memories in the thoughts that that that's going to mine. Just make it harder to
and get it focused so Simplicity means when every time that calling comes right at you know I see something image comes to the eyes and it's pulling at my desires in a saying don't you want that you know the yoga says
 actually
 I think it'd be simpler to just let that go and that's a beautiful arts you know of the yogurt of just to be able to make that in you see you and I I believe I think we can say
 that way we know people that have that ability
 and it's not like they're lacking at the ones that are you know living a more meaningful life and more fruitful life and more Dynamic life for more fun like we're happy life but it but it's a little counterintuitive because the census are calling don't own that will make that's exciting try that
 your world is distracting isn't it
big-time says tracking
 do you like we're saying last week instead of the distractions it's like we don't even know there is a there's a path
 where did like looking for distractions we're going out there to distract me I don't know what to do with my life please distract me get me into something you know I've often should I take my kind of heat did Steve Jobs same focus and simplicity and I always think kindness and simplicity and into me the Simplicity takes care of the stuff
 that complicates our life in the kindness takes care of the relationships that can complicate her life and if you're kind to everyone you save yourself a ton of mental and emotional baggage do you know you just kind of everyone that's where a lot of it
that's where most of the pain is it's really mental haven't talked in his students like this to like once we clear up the gross disturbances in our life you know there's certain principles you follow practicing bhakti yoga stopped intoxicating yourself intoxicants can wreck your life with drugs or alcohol or meat eating and it clogs your Consciousness and which is an awkward situations and makes us regret what happened last night Etc once you get those out of your life
 then you got a then you're chanting becomes a little bit more powerful and things will come in your life people will come to life situations will come in your life where you're like oh man I can't believe this person did that to me I can't believe this person said that I can't believe and then you don't understand that this is Krishna is it not the person that said that or did that to you this is Crystal pudding
tagging people to enter into your life is subtle surgery to mess with your head feeling any people to mess with her head it is what you Americans have one with your head too so you can adjust because we're not going to adjust the universe all we have to do is adjust our head when I filled it just everything so everything works as we wanted to work we're going to discharge a just her head and how we deal with people and how we treat people and how we hold on to hurt betrayal and people have acted cruelly and people have acted inappropriately how am I going to deal with that Krishna tags get it's not even those people that's doing it to you they've been tagged by Krishna to enter into your life for your personal edification
 welcome
Fab must be sincere you must be sincere to get them sent to you
 next time someone drives you crazy you go I guess I'm sincere this chanting is working Christian thank you it's thank you Chris that. That's our months or today thank you Cristiano
 things are going apparently South this person enters your life gets you a little disgruntled Ruffles your feathers thank you Christina. Can I grow thank you
 okay I am very sure
 continuing to get into the new chapter today
 oh yeah very excited what is the good stuff and Ryan demoniac School makes sure that bad they just have bad demonic family
but they're good kids the good kids Kids R Kids
 spin the rain in the musketeer game status what are some keto jmod right before he said that she would ride with him which is every means of Conquest when should offer respectful of basins is to the Supreme Lord Narayan Narayan Narayan Ricci the super most human being to Mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and they should have you asked today of the author last operation botheration h m MB a buy-up I'll get back to you tomorrow okay talk to you about the teenage to keep my regular Technician classes in the baggage, by rendering service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated I love you service to the Supreme Lord he was praised the transit of those songs will be established as in a revocable fact when we get out to vote on this yard Jana Jana little Middletown Nina has my she could have been in my heart I was born in the darkness of ignorance of my teachers are
play my eyes with the torch light of knowledge I offer Albay since he's at their Lotus feet bringing for the shoe mud bog with Tom can't just have in chapter 6 text 10 Strokes Hill demoniac schoolmates school next year
 what happened in the last chapter is collage
 couple times got called before his father who the number one had demonic figure in the universe
 and he was asked what you learn in school and both times he gave answers that
 either just directly glorified practices of developing love for Krishna or Vishnu
 or kind of criticizing materialistic life and saying the only answer is to give yourself entirely to Lord Vishnu and his devotees
 it wasn't that he was
kind of ruffle clear any cash Goose Feathers he was just speaking the truth that he knew in a very innocent way
 but the first time it was kind of like that was awkward to the boy has been hearing from the wrong people let's straighten this out you know and the second time he just was so Furious that he said kill him
 imagine that
 and they tried to kill him in many ways and nothing works so then eventually the teacher said you know what okay we've been trying to kill him somehow mystical he's not let's sign school is just a phase it's just a phase let's let's take a deep breath and step back and let's put him back in the educational system and hopefully this will all just work itself out but what happened with our education what's going to happen is perladas going to not only is he not going to get
 do you know why I'm reprogrammed in that school he's going to become
like the poison in the system he's going to again it would no ill intentions but he's just going to speak is true to all his schoolmates and turn them all on the bus see this is a huge take away actually it's when you become very very focused or if you are very very focused on your spiritual life it affects everybody in your Universe you affect it so he's going to go into school just you being you allowed being pro lost our fault that's the potency of becoming connected to Lord Vishnu and you know we're reading in a story but it's happening to you too if you guys don't realize it but you're getting your getting serious those who listen to this podcast and regular basis you getting serious about your spiritual life and people
 who have no interest in bhakti some that you're affecting the
and it's sometimes you're bringing them closer and sometimes you're driving people out of your life and this is what happens when you're constantly hit right shoving a to instructions your hearing and you're speaking about Lord Vishnu and it acts as this you become like this spiritual magnet and all of a sudden different people are getting drawn into your life your tracking a new community and I was saying that before the shows like on a regular basis I say I have great people in my life and it's just it's it's really from being focused on Krishna hearing the bag with him everyday and it draws people or spiritually minded and it also repels a certain people is people in your life that aren't ready to fly as high as you're ready to fly we shouldn't hate them but they're just not ready to take off into the outer regions of space and this is where this is weird
you can take as it takes us somewhere else
 and so get ready for people getting drawn in and get ready for people being like you know what you've gone too far I can't do this one more thing about what we're about to hear yeah
 is yesterday we had this question about you know Dharma hard to, Moksha this kind of classic standard blue shark that is this this idea of this kind of gradual progression in life that we can make and in the end hopefully you've let go of everything and you find Moksha you need for yourself of all your material desires and transcend the most of nature in summer and you know there's some validity in the idea for sure that you know one can pass through stages like that in life
 but we spoke about this pray a shark that that promise.
is really about the real goal and want to just focus on that and if they do they don't necessarily have to go through all the stages ever mentioned before now what you can do as you can take each of those stages still live them but refuses them with Patty and that's like a month cents a perfect safe kind of path you know you know you can be darn making life for Krishna you know you can earn in life for Krishna excetera you not even your your your the filming of your desires can be done in a way that's entirely harmonious with service to Christian etcetera so we don't necessarily take the normal smooth suck dick have to God it's usually you can or it could be played with disaster like I'm intoxicated live in California in Calistoga
State Patty's day that you take the highway 34 in Summit a drug of choice and then all of a sudden they get touch with Bach in like you know what that's all for I caught it and said he missed all the Dharma Arctic, Moksha and they go in like I'm right I just want Krishna Indian how are you get it's different different but The Vedas teach a gradual path of surrender
 but if I do find it America off in time but we're not so gradual were extremists in the bottom says forget what The Vedas are saying
 in surrendering to me now I get that but that still is for the people going through that is the ultimate goal but I think it's still for people going through that gradual stage and finally it's Christmas and we'll just now and just hop on the bus Gus
Rising people to wait until they're all to give their life to Krishna not so you're old like a lot of it to your old I'm saying that's what the banister recommending
 but I can tell you is I would never recommend you that people are coming from anywhere and realize how can I'm going to skip all those got to go right to Krista. But we're going to hear it now as provide is he's going to speak on that level with me and I was really happy and the chat for it and I'm happy I'm a pretty happy guy right Mara Mara says yes but this message is going to be one hundred percent hey right now don't waste any time you know what there's very Little Tikes talking to kids like 5-year old kids isn't saying we don't have much time we got to get focused right now
get focused on back to get focused on just giving everything you don't give in your body mind words heart so I'll give it all now wait it's it's a powerful it's like a pep talk he's about he's got like the kids around him and it's like he's giving him a pep talk like let's not waste our lives kids come on let's make the most of this is not waste any time let's get focused and let's give ourselves entirely to our God is powerful powerful speeches about together yeah
 alright so let's get into this ready just text one is prologue speaking one who is sufficiently intelligent she he's telling us to a bunch of five-year-olds are the five year olds are sitting there with their hands crossed as I can okay stop playing with your blocks and your stuffed animals and just listen to hear okay so if I want another five year old steps in okay you guys sit down listen to me
 one who is sufficiently intelligent should use the
human form of body
 the human form of body very beginning of Life in other words from the tender age of childhood to practice the activities of devotional service giving up all other engagements giving it all the rest I even stuffed animals animals
 the human body have my daughter is 18 she still can't give up her stuffed animals in special. Having a human form body so don't wait right from the very beginning let's practice bhakti and now he's going to give some more reasons why one should do it now well you know just to backtrack a little because something's we've we've read these books for years but some people are new to the show the idea is in this human species this is our chance this is the Gateway
out of birth and death where's the other species of Life they're acting
 on Instinct yeah that's pretty much where he's going and species and there's a human species when you get to a human species don't screw around exactly where off the leash and end our human life as other species were on a leash for acting by Instinct right you slap a tiger in the nose a tiger bites you you know why do tigers do you don't slap Tigers they act on Instinct they're not going to be like I was too bad our day I'm not going to buy them if he wants to hit me that's okay I understand I'm understanding know you have to wait to call you now we're off the leash for humans you can do whatever you want and how do we take that freedom often times it's misused Freedom gets in trouble
 okay so that he's going to kind of say that neither you keep going rogue what is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form
a body from the very beginning of Life in other words from the tender age of childhood to practice activities with emotional service giving up all other engagements yeah
 the human body is most rarely achieved that's a big point so he looks like he's trying to drill it in
 do you know if you counted all of the other species and how many there are of them is kind of like you're lucky to land in the human body when you finally get there and as you were saying you don't want to screw it up it's it's it's rare it's a rare opportunity if all this stuff is true I'm just putting this out there but all this stuff isn't true and I'm not saying it is if it is you've been various types of bugs and bees and hornets and birds and birds of prey and sitting ducks and dolphins and
you did tadpoles and eat a snapping turtles and then things that kill snapping turtles that sounds really weird things like platypus even a platypus so you have I have you been doing time in these bodies learning some lesson whatever lesson platypuses are having and now is your chance they said okay now you're a police you're human and what are we doing we're going to like to watch like the San Francisco 49ers games are you crazy, hating ourselves gold and gold and red and dancing and riding touchdown on our chests you know what they are 12 other friends
 anyway
 is it just the 49ers or is it other teams as well every team in their bodies in the color of their team people doing an indie
do it with Cricket to same thing it's like what you were looking for distractions were off the leash
 and we have no one liked the leashes and bad Alicia's and bad like it helps control each other if that's what intelligence is intelligence is supposed to be the leash for the money because it's what it is is it's just like say you're on a chariot and they were like five powerful horses pulling it and someone said here let's connect these reins so that you could control the horses you like why do on a leash
 the leashes and holding you back the leash is getting those powerful horses under control so you can direct this Chariot where you wanted to go and that's that's what we're doing is released in the senses weird that makes us free sure it all becomes free when the sensors are brought under control in the sensors are not under control but I do like your analogy station for your analogy that's the
basic basic analogy but I'm liking this one about the leash because The Vedic the beta teachings are the leash and after while and a lot of us have thought the teachings of self-control we fought the teachings of controlling your mind and your sense is in your belly and your genitals we fought it even though we know in our heart of hearts you know I got to control this and then all of a sudden by hearing on a regular basis were like okay that actually makes sense I'm going to follow up and then you're like the dog who's been trained to be off the leash and a certain dogs not my dog there certain dogs that can you could just see they they Don't Stray they come right back and when the master says okay come on sit over here sit next to me next to me in the car they're good. Good dogs if I bring my dog in my car roll down the window that dogs jumping out the window he's just like that's the way he's not trained so we've been off at least we've been fighting Vedic Authority would invite him to date a truth which is
best interest it's in my dog's best interest not the jump out of the pickup truck but he'll still jump out those it just doesn't get it so that's what we're doing by hearing or training are some just to be happy or trailers and then you then you can go off a leash it's okay right in the beginning stages of our body
 we have to be on a leash in the leashes like when do you get to be uncontrolled right now so yeah it is woven into your lack of course I'm not going to do that a lot of people in the show that have never drank alcohol or never taken drugs or never done heroin you know and if I say hey you want some heroin which I won't say if I was to say that they'll be like no I don't want that people do it all the time I'm not going to do it I've heard about what I can do there's people they just don't go there
they just won't go there they just won't do it and it's because they can be off the leash they can be around people doing heroin and be not not into doing it that was okay but I want to go back to my analogy is better I don't want your ancient analogy of a Greek and Roman gods driving a multi horse and Chariot try to update it for the future let's try to get through text one here while I quit Laura Bina says we get electric collars and sometimes we have bad for the topic this weekend or when you go right to the person who's got chaos drama addiction bad habits you sniff them out and go right to them it's as if they're calling you man
genetically those are called broken Pickers who's got one put it on the board
 okay I think human body is most rarely achieved in all our temporary like other bodies it is Meaningful because of the human life one can perform body even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one
 complete Perfection nice nicer now he's not going to he's going to keep pushing
 for example you work overtime Hill this morning and you're saying prayers and you just like that alone
 and savior who knows where that can direct you who knows how that can spin who knows have that can you to a whole new.
in your life Precious Moments are precious moments you and me meeting 30 plus years ago who knows where that sacred meeting could bring us here holding hands together looking each other eyes hugging each other occasionally you know who think that
 hey hey by the way Mary you still got the ruggedness face off all fogged out here you know what I started looking at you more carefully when I did it has like always all foggy at my appearance to make me look at any time you can see me gracefully entire face
 we want to see where I go see me at all my beauty with all my crow's feet my sags and my bags
have you done it yet still looking for a lie to me
 new Sky clean the camera
 okay, it's not about me all right now you work on that road test number to get rid of my text number to the human form of Life affords One a chance to return home back to godhead
 we don't even care that that I don't even I don't get that I get that spiritual life is good because it makes me happy I get that I can control my senses I get that I need to meditate and chant I get that I'll even get that it's a whole spiritual realm I'm going to go I'm not. It's about breaking out of the Matrix right there and my favorite songs from the eighties there for every living entity specially in the human form of life
 must engage in devotionals
service to the Lotus feet of Lord Vishnu
 this devotional service is natural because Lord Vishnu the Supreme person out of godhead is the most beloved the master of the soul and the well-wisher of all living beings Suites huh the master of the soul is the odd Manish photo is a sufrir. He's the best well-wisher and friend he is sort of a boot turn on Priya
 he is the most beloved 22 everyone to all of the entities that's who you connect to it that's the opportunity
 is a soulmate
 is it real soulmate is the real soulmate people talk about their soulmate come on text me
 glamorous you know what we're going to hear in text 3
 you get
 kind of like a
a framework or or it's just a whole nother way of looking at the world that most people will never come to on their own but if a wise person can come and share the what we're going to read right now everybody
 this could be just a game-changer for you if you if you think you know what I'm willing to give living like that a try I'm willing to try to look at the world through that lens and see if it improves the quality of my life
 what Siri says my dear friends of demoniac families the happiness proceed with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life according to one's past fruitive activities that I was saying you know what this idea of finding happiness through connecting the senses with the object of the senses in all
what other forms of life you have the opportunity to do that so if it's if that's what you think life is all about that's probably going to be the kind of body that you get in your next life if that's where you think you find satisfaction meaning happiness excited now this next line is a is a game changer
 such happiness is automatically obtained without Endeavor just as we obtain distress right there so you know he's saying we come into this life with a bag load of karma
 and that karma is going to mean that we're going to get some happiness or going to get some distressed basically you know which one is truck already talked or he comments on this he says having a human form one should not Endeavour for material happiness that you said happiness in distress
the qualities of the body does fight anybody want to change both of these we've got a human body and means we're going to get happiness like material happiness and material the stress they're going to come my karmic you know background is going to determine that and get those two I don't just like I don't Endeavor for distress but it comes sure I don't have to waste my time doing ridiculous things to try to find happiness that will come as well don't even need to try me and Joy are we making this joke the other yesterday here fishy 8 of The Wedding who's the priest that was the initiator but we were saying something like yeah go out and do something to make yourself happy he's like yeah I'll go out and do something to make myself happy I'll go rollerblading. Rollerblading any trip any like shattered his elbow and his wrist so we're making up the idea of we have an idea in the material world of happiness happy
but our car has another plan for us and sometimes we see people there like there is nothing to do tonight no one likes me I'm going to stay home and have like the best time of their life and other times we plan trips vacations parties Etc and they're just like nothing lived it and you did ever we go on a cruise and there is a maritime disaster that happens you might still want you to come and talk to this Runner
 x3's commentary
 Material World in any form of life there is some so-called happiness and so-called the stress doesn't matter your platypus whenever you are yeah alligator
but at your wing
 platypuses that Wings Over
 but the flipper Wings they got bills I got duck bills and all that I've got bills with wings fly they don't know why I thought that Wing flippers like duck feet to like like a like a flapper on a tortoise anyway no one invites distress in order to suffer but still it comes similarly right. That is just like I'm going to I'm going to do something that makes
 makes me happy you should make me happy that we got to get out in the fresh air skate around
 Karma said you know what we got another you want to find happiness right now but you do some suffering that's what you going to get as far as your Endeavor it is floating around the park
 Hobby Lobby dual SIM
but still comes similarly even if we do not Endeavor to obtain the advantages of material happiness we shall obtain them automatically this happiness in distress are obtainable in any form of life without Endeavor us
 there is no need to waste time and energy fighting against distress or working very hard for happiness are only business in the human form of life should be to revive our relationship with a speed person out of godhead and dust become qualified to return turn home back to godhead here we go the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing that's the main thing revive your spiritual life it's been dormant it's there it's within you it's been sleeping that's where the real happiness. The material up and down stuff real Turtle stuff
 had a girlfriend
father made so much money and then you just lost everything
 tablets yeah it happened it happened spend some you have no money they just get an inheritance and get money it's as if it almost appears like it's out of your hands
