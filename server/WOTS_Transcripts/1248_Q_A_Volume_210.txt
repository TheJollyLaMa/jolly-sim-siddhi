 hello. Hello.
today by
 life Calcutta this is wisdom of the ages of a Leo to podcast with your host and co-host and Senior educator the Barclays Center in New York City with us walk in the show everybody watching the couch and my poor 4 hours north of me on the hooghly aka the Ganga
 but it's an alarm called Calcutta regular I thought you were all the cold cut or cut call cata Kolkata
 you know it's like the East India Company just built their the city on top of three villages
 results of really interesting us tuba
the gang of course but it's actually supposed to say because if you actually look at a map with Gung up goes parallel to the river that runs through Maya Port which we call the ganga here they called the Hoobly it's sort of a portion of the gun the runs parallel and the ends up in banga but I guess at the end of the school Glee is what they call ganga Sagar at the end of the Ganga
 is where I'm at you know I haven't been in Calcutta and so long for Bill since it's like I was a new devotee
 set up the weather now we're proud pods met should have bought you some of his horse had to talk what you got to go there we ordered me to go there the other day you should be trying to pass that word around to me thank you
no I mean I mean my mom told me to clean my room can you clean my room for me like that that's why he feels that such a valuable experience rather than a log that to myself and then come on the show and say how I did it and you didn't intentions and I'm always thinking it's just like the saxophone and there's a lot of things to do in museum but I'm not doing any of those things you know why I am getting all my ducks in a row for the release of my book The Reeb mapping my website and I don't do nothing but stay in this room and just working for 4 days
 and then I'm going on a creative trip to go up when I'm working on another book creative trip I'm going to create a trip and then I got to go
this whole thing up and I'm looking forward to it good to you
 yeah how are you just getting better we had a lovely day today at the ganga with Corona and family
 Little Korea 10-years old Adventure awaits you took her first congas night it was cold
 and at first she was you know I'm struggling to get in there and afraid to dunk under and you know it's cuz it's cold you know and then I got to read a hunk of raw goo to come over and do something you have to do it cuz the cuz then I started to leave and she's like oh it's now or never so she said I never said okay you want to do it with me she said yes I said okay then you got to go with me though okay you already promised her while she said yes it was a deep
 I'm not very due to deep enough to dunk okay then and so then I then then I got out that she got that she went back in alone
 and then I
the yogi in her because then she went deeper and then she just started to concentrate and she was just standing there alone looking out at the Ganga
 and then she started to dunk you wouldn't see what she wouldn't have 10 times and I saw she was just standing there like in some kind of meditative pose you know
 I said something's going on with Corona she said she's been inside a measurement that like a real actor to I just wakes her up from previous lives yeah it's anything anything like that could have been happening so I was impressed I could see she's not ordinary she's she's like a yogi she's going with her yoga kind of like hanging out just on her own you know I watched a conqueror of her mind and senses I watched you do it was pretty cool
 special birth being children of devotees plus Humira like a we had a Shreya stripe of from Australia in miles
Michelle talk about his Kitty races kids and devoted the kid and I'm like a kid then just don't get interested in it and then the kids turn listen to podcast and sort of woke up it was already in him
 they're special births to be taking birth and families and the parents think well then I'm going to make my kid a devotee you'll have to do that that you can encourage a kid on the spiritual path but you'd be surprised what is already in that kid of yours it's quite impressive
 but sometimes you just need the right person at the right place or the right experience maybe a dip in the ganga and all of a sudden Uncle Drago pushing again... When your head under water
 nice well
Cuban a day today people selling questions were ready for answers and a couple of announcements Miss Mara tell us what's happening today at 9:30 a.m. there's a beginner's meeting at 11 a.m. is Joppa Sutter Tsonga and it's 12:30 is an ACA meeting eastern time and then tomorrow we'll do the show at the same time spot which is 8 a.m. and we'll do a Q&A again sending more questions till we can take them
 wisdom of the sages 108 at gmail.com
 I've been to this Miss Mara
 yeah or Casteel who's at the questions I sent to you as well
 we used to do this thing where I get one you get when I get when you get with the house like a free-for-all were both going up what why is that I don't know
make a rule and not tell me about it well you just kind of went with it
 does it happen naturally I got to go to tell him
 okay here's one hey Mara was it from
 it was just at a 3:00 train graduated she's a great lady she's great so hey Mara I have a question for you and the story with Indra and when she gets cursed to become a hog
 it said that the story explains how powerful Maya is well I can understand that the influence of Maya made him forget his Godly matter isn't he
enthralled in his incarnation of being a pig kind of the point we incarnate to learn certain lessons when I first read the story the first thing that came to mind was one of judgment when we put our own judgments on the pigs we think how grotesque but the Pixies his family and his wife and he sees his the true nature of love and in life finding pure Bliss in ignorance so I guess the question is how does the story demonstrate how Mya's illusion get in the way of our spiritual advancement if that illusion is what is needed to find more spiritual advancement
 good question is that really explain the story do we need to tell the story we definitely need to tell the story
 well here is King Indra the Lord the Lord of all the demigods truth except for Vermont he starts second to none
very very very refund being has his own planet is planet is considered to be near the heaven of heavens
 and you the same offense he got cursed to take birth on Earth as a pic in India you see how pigs live they actually sit in in
 I called stool they like swamps that people like go to the bathroom and they eat and they eat sewage and they love it
 and they're covered in it and sometimes I ever have your dog is my dog jumps in the pond and he likes themselves out and they shake the shake and then you're like I still get me all wet the pigs will do that in the feces and then Shake themselves and you're like yeah
 so
she said well what's the big deal anyway Indra when all the demigods all the other demigods who enjoys their leader they were like oh we can't tolerate to see our Lord in this lowly position so they they went to visit him on Earth and all the great demigods Hannah said listen injury
 you got to you got to apologize for what you've done during this horrible lowly position for Mark Hammond and told him your return is up you can come back now and he was saying I like it what why would I want to get out of here it's great looking at my beautiful wife look at that tail it look adorable little piggy kids and why would I ever give up this so that's the story could still be want to poke around with The Muse question question seems to be going I'm not sure if I'm cheated on just right but it seems like she's going into directions with it if I understand it
want to talk about judgment and otherwise I think when she sent and she mentioned well here he is he's finding pure Bliss in ignorance so what's wrong with that if someone finds this one way why do we judge it is right and if someone finds listening all the way why do we judge it is wrong
 so what even though the pig is slopping around in sewage is it is it being judgemental to say oh that's like why do we pity that it seems that that's part of a question then. But at the end of her questions she she kind of it seemed to me to go in a bit of a different direction saying that she says I guess the question is how does the story demonstrate how my solution is get in the way of our spiritual advancement if that illusion is what is needed to find more spiritual than spend another words he was cursed to experience that for a reason
 so then that's good right well it's only good if he gets if he learns the lesson that right
so so but let me start hear what this story is meant to illustrate is at
 the nature of this world in the nature of how our minds and our senses work is that we become normalized to suffering
 however abominable it may be we after sometime whatever our situation is begins to feel like it's normal and we begin and end there's a programming
 that's a mental programming that connects the census
 in the objects of the senses the registers how our senses respond to the objects of the senses and what happens is we when I say we become normalized to suffering it registers just in a comfort or pleasure
 that we never move out of that slop will they stay in there you know so it so the so the pigs mind is programmed in such a way with saying this is
could this actually smells good and then the pig follows that programme
 now getting to the second part of her of her question we we all have free will
 you know that's that's something that we all have and when were exposed to the circumstances that are created through the illusory energy we all have the opportunity to apply that Free Will and to learn from that experience and grow through that experience or
 not too and to just dig deeper into the slop and keeper and you know and continue to live in the sewage so it's a graphic story it's a story that is meant to kind of
 it's it it's meant to kind of yeah reach into that discussed that we have but it's it's saying that I'm one hand with me is saying that it makes sense like in one sense our enjoyment
material enjoyment weather be on the Earthly level on the piggish Earthly level or on the Heavenly level of Indra for the vaishnava for the body only for the person that's tasted real the real Bliss not the artificial Bliss the real Bliss of the self of the what's inside some of this experience that they're going to look nauseous is the pig they're going to look at Insurance saying how beautiful
 I'm sad right I wish I could help them understand what their potential is that the happened because all the happiness
 of of the material Realm
 is a blend of happiness in in misery
 and so again whether it's the pig or whether it's the regular Earthling or whether it's Indra that the Deep spiritualist looks at that with a sense of compassion and not judge not judgmental is compassion
right at you you might see someone suffering you know physical pain is not judgemental to say oh no they're suffering that's compassion so so so the story is meant to help us understand that we're very prone
 we're very prone to become normalized
 2 to the 22 sing material enjoyment and the suffering that comes with it as desirable when and it's sad if we limit ourselves to that it's sad if we don't with our ears hear about what's beyond it with our minds apply to what could be Beyond it and input in that effort to to learn from this and try to to try to go beyond it and that's the compassion that is, it's not judgmentalism his compassion and so that's how I understand the story
Sarah do you know I look I always tell the story how often times skip this story use my own analogy and yeah we are not judgment but it's Discerning and sizing things up when I was a teenager and I was you know call myself straight edge I lived on the Lower East Side and it was a time where like heroin addiction was out of control and you see people wearing nice suits and stuff like that but they were strung out on heroin and they literally be standing up and not hang out you seem to be happening like a first in the morning I'm going out for a jog at 6 and you know 6:30 a.m. and someone is right there you know what I mean
 someone is right there and sell it just standing there
 so anyway
 sorry for the phone right it's one of those like if you were to offer that person anything help
a bowl of organic fruit a fruit salad and organic salad brown rice and beans they wouldn't want it why because their taste is so covered by illusion that they think very thing that is dismantling their family their career their life is a good thing
 they'll just Embrace that that's what they'll ask for they don't want anything or can they don't want something that's going to help them or heal them but standing outside of it you could say this is so sad but wasting your life so when we see a person absorb the pig life yeah we do have compassion because we know it to suffering condition and we should be as humans
 we understand that humans can act very very high they can be Noble they can be beautiful and courageous or they can act really really low so human that we have these this
lie to you don't got to go real North or real south animals are in a in a position of a fearful condition of eating and sleeping in mating and defending so if interested in this position it might appear good in the same way it appears that way what am I being a bird do you know your people say that what am I being a bird oh yeah they live in fear constantly they aren't there eating at the bird feeder and they're looking over their shoulder or a deer in it is very it's very rare that most animals except if you're at the top of the food chain don't let me some type of horrific fear and so fearing mating sleeping old age and when you get to old age there's no natural death for animals for the most part they start to get picked off once they get weak
 so yeah ignorance is not Bliss not by a long shot
 and in it is Indra was in a position
where he couldn't see like I'm missing out on something greater and that's what the story supposed to illustrate like we actually have amazing spiritual potential but we're settling for a low-class low-brow low-brow lifestyle everything is low class and we think it's pretty good it's pretty nice because we're like injured or like the pig in stool thinking that the school is great and when you get a higher taste and that's what this the famous verse from the bug of agita as soon as one experiences a higher type type of pleasure there was a time in our life where Friday night going out getting hammered I was your bragging to your friends we were so wasted now to look back at that we're like What are we crazy what were we thinking do not want to go there
 do you like to go to bed early like to wake up early
8:30 I didn't bad like to rise early the nectar is in Rising early and I'm staying up late that's been getting a little rated out of your mind with intoxicants and you have a hangover the next day that's like a pig in stool so that's what that's what Maya does to us and makes it Maya Max us think the worst things are really cool really wonderful that they're generally in Thomas androgynous
 okay that's how I take it thank you
 what's the number to is hello will you please explain who is how about pods review
call Aaron how are you
 will you please expand explain probably pods view on the trim work profile on guru's Guru on the tree Morty so if you're studying 8th grade Hinduism which I did you know there's this idea tree Morty which is brownish even Vishnu and very a very lame way to explain what that is it's like father son Holy Ghost and sounded explain it I remember an eighth grade actually studied it in school. Play
 well they want to send that but I went to public school we learned tons of Hinduism but we learn like okay there's Hinduism worship various gods and Idols of a monkey god River got a mountain God it kind of moon was that they kind of moved me out of the rug
class before we got to do they put you in that but you out in the hot out in the yard
 but the tree Morty's brownish even Vishnu how does prop hunt explain those cuz Diva shree more to he usually uses a turn the Luna Hobbit our insurance so so what is is confused on this with such as this country but this is the view of the gravity visors that beat the view of the followers of shoe Tanya as they understand the writings of yes
 and that is that everything Springs you see if you if you did hear this in a class in Hinduism they're probably saying what the Hindus believe that there are three guys one for creation one for maintenance my for Destruction right and then you walk away from that thing okay I guess they believe
if it's 3:30 p.m. powerful I've always believed in one you know where the way that I was raised as one God they believe that there's three you wouldn't be walking away with a clear understanding if you walk like that so the way that we we understand the teachings through sure involved with him which we accept as the commentary by vyas on his his other writings on particularly in the vedanta Sutra
 is that behind everything there's also ultimately One Source One living Source One personal Source One God one personal got right in that Shri Krishna
 and he manifest that one Krishna he he's got multifarious energies right in here and he manifests himself and multifarious ways and all different varieties of ways that there's something called the purush avatars which are three different levels of Lord Vishnu that are you know
that Krishna that boy Krishna he's existing beyond the material realm right beyond the bubble of the material world which has unlimited universe is in it multiverses right he's mad vertically perhaps yeah he's existing beyond that and then for the maintenance of the multi versus right he manifests three purusha avatars three different levels of Lord Vishnu one is kind of the soul of the entire Material World then one is the soul of each universe and then one goes in and accompanies each individual soul on its on its sojourn so those are pro shop at ours he comes is Lila avatars he comes for play
 usually performing Some Kind of Rescue you know whether it's as a fish whether it says a tortoise weather is a Half Men half lime sometimes even that Krishna who's beyond the material comes in as an avatar as himself as Shri Krishna
and so he comes in at Universal or drama he comes soon as we allowed ourselves to her play descending for play sometimes it comes as you got Avatar which means in the in the four different seasons of of time as they cycle
 an avatar welcome to demonstrate the did the path of yoga for that for that you got for that time. So it comes as you got a charge for that purpose and the what Aaron is referring to a stream or tea here we would call that the Boon of avatars that this material realm is composed of three varieties of material energy sudfeld Rogers and Thomas
 and that there's an avatar that is presiding over each one of those Lord Lord Narayan what is presiding over stuff
Lord Shiva over Rodger Buna and I'm sorry but she is over Telangana and Lord from all over Rodger Buna so the three phases of time creation maintenance and destruction you can say are overseen by these three avatars but it's not that we see them all Syke we see them all is krishna's energy like it probably would often quotes shankaracharya
 I believe was quoting another source although I'm not sure where you're coming from but probably always quotes closer to Shankar traces and Ryan approve you got that before
 when vegetables at the time of the art of the actor before before the universe was manifest their Ryan up how do you know Nora Ann is beyond all that he's before all that so first there's Narayan Vishnu and then everything that manifests in his mature world including The Goonies including the Goon
guitars those are energies separated energies of Lord Narayan or Lord Vishnu so the three gonna avatars what the question was what is his commissary or what is the gout review our view is that
 the three are all different energies of Krishna by the pinna Ryan who is Christian himself Weatherby Shiva who is a transformation of Narayan
 unique transformation ride or Weatherby who in most cases is an individual sole like URI with that is especially empowered that to to preside over these three phases of time or to preside over these three varieties of matter of he manifests himself or manifest in powers and other Bean to preside over those Energies
 oh my God
pretty good pretty good of a kind of avatars right all different kind of everything is in that outer space is out there
 his actions it's out there so it's quite fantastic we can't even fathom we're just going by what Clues the sacred literature gives us but Brahma shiya Vishnu
 the father-son the Holy Spirit thing that's not the answer that's not the answer but you know that the thing is if you if we really want understand this
 we have to understand that the conceptions the theological concessions that are coming out of Bob with time and out of the osses works
 its nuances creative it's it's it's wild it's beautiful it's sophisticated it's so far out and it's not a simplistic thing though they believe in 3. If not you you're not digging deep enough you're not really trying to understand yeah if you're going to just sit right there
there's one supreme.
 They all got their Works to do the Manifest in many different way that complete I'm going to go to the next question from yet which is from animus and anima so I really like this question cuz I am with the person
 how important is it for us to desire to go back to godhead the back to the spiritual world is it such as it is such a far-out concept to me that I could that I could that I could even go back trust me when I say that I'm that even in this one lifetime I've been many people and I'm not proud of it when I think of why I have chosen this path by first thought has never been to go back to the spiritual home it's more about trying to return
it has been giving to me unconditionally but is that really enough I hear so many devotees talk about going back and I understand it but I don't feel it I don't know I don't know how things work I never live this life before and I'm definitely an over-thinker your thoughts an Insight on this matter are much appreciated if you want to explain what what they're asking exactly what is going back to God I have the expression going back to God had which means
 the soul doesn't go to a higher planet or a lower planet that hellish Planet they could actually out of the material Universe altogether they go back to the spiritual realm and have to pick up some spiritual relationship with God with Krishna and so they're saying well it's not a lofty concept you know it's not a good Christian saying I really want to go to have
go to heaven when you go to heaven so this person saying you know I find it hard just to deal with that I fine like I just got to return love and see God and everybody perhaps I'm like I'm like this person as well I've never think I'm going to go back to godhead I'm not really thinking about my death but I practice bhakti
 for now for today cuz today it feels right and I like myself as a practitioner bhakti yoga I like who I'm becoming I like that helps me control my mind control my senses control my thoughts makes me rise to the occasion become a better person and in invite doing that I'm changing my atmosphere I'm changing the circle of people in my life like drastically I was sitting with you yesterday you me and Tara we're reading together me tarah and push do it we're almost all sixty years old and reading from Lord satanas pastimes together and me
Sarah and Katherine a have been reading to Catherine Ann Moses and it was nice to have you guys there two were already together and now those guys were listening to all three of us read but it was so special like in my mind I was thinking what a special little Club this is right now what a beautiful group of people this is right now and I said that too it was it was special and so yeah I feel like I'm going to hire Planet so not just in this at this life is special but the yogis the great side of the great rishis the great sages say Ashley what you're preparing in this life
 is preparing you for your next life
 you're preparing your Consciousness and whatever your Consciousness is like you're going to track people like that if you're really into partying and drinking you'll find people that are departing and drinking
Sports you find people that are into sports if you're the high spiritual topics you don't find that in this life and the next life so I'm I'm with you you don't I'm not planning my death at Mike it's got to be great when I die I'm planning this life I like what I'm attracting in this life what do you say about that Mystic a
 yeah I am with you I mean
 certainly she'll probably use that phrase quite a bit
 you don't go back to godhead
 but if we really read his books and EPS will see that he wasn't merely indicating some kind of like escapists kind of idea
 you know another phrase I can find she'll probably sit out and it's really kind of a queen a phrase from Rubidoux swap meets body rest and reaches into his profile would sometimes say he stay like that
simply somehow or other
 you become attached to Krishna so you know
 he was also fond of quoting of verses in Patna piranha
 I'm smart of you set the time Vision or this part of your nature to cheat survey of it in the shade store a theory of a king cobra that's smart of you said the television or one should remember all the time for division doors are Krishna and which part of this part of your attitude and one should never forget Krishna and that sorry I didn't say that you are a theory of a canker that all the other rules and all the other regulations everything mentioned in the shastra is everything mentioned in this sacred text
 they exist just for the purpose of those other two rules right all the other rules are just for these two that we never mind goes
naturally with the faction to Christian that's the goal going back to godhead if you're all done with your mind goes there doesn't matter whether you're in heaven hell it would be on this material world within this material world these things become insignificant so that's what you do that is what we practice we we are around we are practicing Krishna Consciousness we're not practicing material world escapism but all that being said you know the idea is that your destination is determined by your Consciousness so if you divide that Consciousness the common result of that would you would be you would enter the Loca or the Locale write the place where in that clutch is Loca
 Locale in like the Network's forums that with the word comes from low-income on Locust in Mustang
you welcome Wordsmith my friend just kind of slowed from me with that are wearing is you know the quality of our where is the quality of our Consciousness determines our destination after death and so if your awareness is centered around Krishna and then you the new manifest in a place where everything is centered around Christian that would be back to godhead so would want sense that that that is kind of the secondary thing right there the the resultant
 did that results from the state of unconsciousness but it's the State of Consciousness that's the goal so how is important for us to desire that desire may be the basis for you to velpen that Consciousness you know we are we do read you know Christmas Lila we do we read about and go local
places of Christians Lila's
 2 did you know to develop a desire that why am I here why am I you know the injured in the slop you know when I could be living the life that my soul is designed to live you know it is in the spiritual realm so I don't think
 I could picture of a very serious well-situated Bucky Yogi with the with a very clear desire to transcend this realm and go beyond it
 but but I'm kind of like you and this to organizer you know how I really feel is I feel like I want I want my in a dormant love for Christian to arise
 and exactly how to Rises
that is krishna's business now I'm a follower of shoot your tummy I'm a I'm a product of the mercy of shirt you Tanya
 that there's no question in my mind about that you know I'm a product of the mercy of the followers if she cheats on you in line with Street your tiny and I know that shoot your tiny came especially to give
 that special love that that is Manifest in the hearts of the residents of a diamond
 so therefore I feel it's safe for me to assume that because I'm on the mercy of those vaishnav is that that kind of love will Orizon by Christians Chris
 and so I try to follow
 as well as I can I try to feel a certain indebtedness to to my gurus to show the proud pod into the bumper on and all the great advice to his go up to shoot you Tanya
and whatever they what I what I asked of them what I pray for him from all of them is that that awareness will rise to me and wear it and it would variety rise what my saver will be in one sense I don't see that and I don't
 I don't make a concerted prayer or you know I don't have a formulated desire in that if you want me to come back in or take several more births in this world you know to do to try to serve then that is that is there their decision and it's my
 you know it would be my blessing to be able to
 to serve in that way
 I was speaking too loud
 by the Sea, one of our regular listeners hear that the day you know and she just said you know I'm always thinking my mind I'm always thinking
how we can better serve people to develop their Krishna Consciousness how we can better reach them and she says they said I guess I'm going to be coming back to do this in my life that's cuz that's what I'm always thinking about you know and maybe that's what people like you and I are going to do I don't know
 yeah
 sometime is it when I get older maybe when I get older that will become more of a burning passion for me yeah if that's if that's how Christian of Stokes it in my heart right that's how I feel and I go back to godhood can't stand this pain any longer and then to Rick radhika reminder left his body while we were in India OK definition of prayers out to him whose a problem pot disciple who is a rick Joetta with the meditation world
 he's probably a disciple
in the academic world I guess who I really think I'm is like in Columbia River so you know that right I don't know I didn't really know him at all but I remember I got this email from that prajeena that said a gymna is when a Prop Hunts intimately with the translator bhagat um
 prabhas Sanskrit
 write Sanskrit to English editor editor of the Bible song she's my friend Rick is there and I really want you to you know get to know him take care of he's not he's doing really poorly right now with his health and then two minutes later on us while he said did you see right at the romana's here I think you should go talk to him I was like okay I'm taking this to the sign from God and I had lunch with him and we talked we had a very sweet getting together and he found out he lived not far from me I said please come to the farm would love to have you and
like a sweet exchange you texted back and forth and then he was really looking around the Geva and it was saying he not been away from the devotees for a while this is a beautiful what ramaswamy crazy are so beautiful I was not expecting this and I know we just got this message 2 days ago or 3 days ago that he had left his body up here so disappointed with the world around him and seeking a higher truth Rick left Harvard University
 travel for seven years throughout Europe and India in a lot of that was in his motorcycle out of that was in the the rider Ramon temple in Punjab and right so like yeah, this pill so he left already went to your this pilgrimage is partially recounted in his first book in search of the sacred
in India became initiated into the yogi disciplines of meditational arts and that's really became of discipleship problem
 Eddie's 26 you returned to the west to complete a doctoral program at Columbia University received a PhD in Indian languages and literatures Rick returned to Indiana full body research Grant to study with Scholars and adepts work on the ancient veronick mythical lure
 and write the text of his doctoral dissertation
 which would eventually become tails for the dying and in-depth exploration into the mysteries of Union and separation and classical Indian mythology on and on about his about this before I talk to him I also got that that letter that you got from juniperus so I also to spend some set aside some time to spend with them they're the equivalent you know from me
and that he was a disciple she'll probably but you know it was clear that he whatever his faith was it had expanded in a lot of different directions and you know that weren't so Orthodox in terms of followers show proper to go device, but he was very respectful and respectful of my own face you know I would imagine you cuz people come into an institution like it's kind of special back when he did who knows you know what kind of snow is a crazy times how you treated who you bump into what what what kind of moves you in the different ways you end up moving but I could sense he had a had a very special appreciation for bhakti
 and we had some wonderful conversations very insightful and we had some stuff but I was feeling
 you know he was obviously not healthy he was there at the Eco Village in Raleigh so I was just kind of
gave him carte blanche whatever care he needed like he was providing for him all kind of are you Vedic are and what what I was
 what I was into ting
 and and I spoke to Radha soami later about this in which kind of confirmed my intuition in expanded on it
 was that his some of that was special the prop hunt in right at the end of his life when you know what he was physically Elling you know adhisaya caring loving the psycho probably invited him and said I don't care if you haven't been in this Con all these years and I don't care you're dear to me and you do too proud cut in, and let us take care of you and and I think he's so much appreciated that care but I think when I also got the impression was seeing ecovillages cell
 wow here here's a simple fall apart in and some like rhinos find me who trying to capture the essence of a
I was teaching created this
 this amazing you know amazing eco-village which teaches and demonstrates bhakti
 and such an incredible in such a way that an academic like him would also appreciate especially I think it just felt to me like Krishna was reaching into his heart towards in his final days where his face and shoe the pro-pot is facing she'll probably followers Iz facing future Tanya is face and body may have been somehow
