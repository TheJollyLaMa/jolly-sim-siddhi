 I sit on the balcony and in watching this and it was definitely surreal separate

 that the mid-90s, but I saw you today like last year but it's right and I really appreciated that and anyway months and shelter even more because your messages so
 directly you know Bucky the whole of the whole band sounded great
 and Encino do the whole the whole message in the vibe that was coming through
 it just you know why I sent a club like that I just
think like it is and not to kind of put anyone down or anything like that but
 it's just the majority of the messages that are usually coming in that in that area you know or just you know darker or do you know if you're such an incredibly Positive Vibes coming through and you can just you can see the people respond to that it's like it's refreshing you know some frenzy had it's okay to be happy it's okay to be good commissions be happy you don't have to hate those it was nice yeah it was really sweet I meant the end up Roku you don't truthfully I was a little hesitant to do that generation records in store I just was like really know anybody I don't know who is coming I don't know if anybody would come my mother said she wanted to come how's it going I'm going to merge my mother in with the New York City hardcore scene
older sister shows up and then my younger brother shows up as a car this is coming it's like when your Worlds Collide my world for infant loading in off of worlds are colliding but it works out great for 17 take the TV take a picture of me and your mother together get her all three of us

 you pause back on the 17th he's back on the show in the eighties are going to show they really I'm trying to line up another show with Dunya
 and maybe some other around
 you know counselors you know the professor
sorts and it in cuz there's some really great questions came up from the
 came up from the stage groups that have to do with
 how do we apply bhakti to our mental health issues with that mental health is always been there but we just ignored it or have people just got to see me mental health issues right now so my question is has it always been
 prevalent in in in in culture but we just overlooked it we're just more as my mentor by president or mental health problems mental health problems have they always been there but we just been in survival mode now we have imagine they've always been there with pride there that more there now than ever in my guess
maybe we just have more maybe a more time on our hands to be like I'm sad where the old anything to do in the old days
 I don't know if he will have a lot of time in my hands are working long hours and stuff yeah actually true true anyway let's not go into that really this is your book released okay
 are we going to do at home to mow Papaoutai by so very well. Your book Sage saying Guru Bostitch it wasn't that pretty he's got a great voice cuz it's got a beautiful like
 I know he's not the singer but he's got to be a better choice than me that's why I'm not saying it yeah you got a lot of people don't know these beautiful prayers to the guru written by a master
they should not talk about Itachi talk or and before we end the set with the theme song shelter which is really driving through the forest he starts over this very beautiful some side of the chicken to the guitar but it's so beautiful change the energy of the entire Club going on alright this is maybe Mary should tell Everett right now where it's available and all that to just so that we get that up front
 Garry's Mod on Amazon and I'm going to put the link in the show notes as well as on the zoom chat part thanks thanks great book to give out to friends and got one for yourself it was for a friend and if you get it on Amazon
even if you didn't get out of there cuz I need to go to Amazon and say hey I got this at a show
 then write a review give me five star review it helps all the algorithms are trying to spread this message of the story is my story but it's everybody's it's really at the story of coming to God for my material life so I think in that sense people can relate to it so the book is called from Punk'd among a memoir by Ray cappo that's what you want with Ray rug enough cap you know what I didn't know what to do with these not even my kids don't know me but it's sort of like a lot of people know me as brass so it's true real from the bands with Italian shelter and we got Jay Shetty right here just speaking to what you were saying right now to recognize transformation shows have one person one person's choice to evolve can change lives of so many
 that's your choice but it wasn't an easy
now we're going to hear about just how difficult it was sure I'm going to jump ahead the book starts an interesting places is it starts with you on a train from Delhi to Calcutta after having just left from Dobbin yeah so you know I honestly haven't had a chance to read the book I just got a coffee yeah but but I've stopped jumping around and pick up some things out I had some help from Linda Linda Linda to some sections but I wanted to go here first so you know of course is going to deal with your with your teenage life and what you're going through and how you had some success with your band but also you got to do some felt some disillusionment from that
 and meanwhile you're this these are your kind of searching spiritually and these teachings from Bhagavad Gita and so on being an influence you and you went to India
and in India you do you speak about your time there in Punjab and you know there are the very special Christmas Centric area holy place and that you in the book that place for you is both like you know a place of like joy and fun and wonderment and Discovery but it's also like really challenging to live because you're living a monks monks in your having to
 I suppose it's kind of like holding a mirror up to yourself and seeing where you're at and you know me like you do on your back in New York and read your books and did you know I was talking to people it's like all I'm really deeply spiritual but then when you get thrown a few would have crashed and cancel your like I'm cut out for this exactly exactly get to face all your demons in an intense concentrated environment so this is what you right at the end of one chapter I'm going to read this first then when you jump to the beginning of the book cuz they're kind of canoe
but you wrote brindavanam was a dose of medicine too big for me to swallow as much as I had this vision of nirvana in the Holy Land I wasn't pure enough to be there I knew this it was something about this place that brought me very high and very low
 like a purging of lifetimes of karma in a few months in the Holy that interesting at you so you saying was kind of like um
 sometimes there's something that's good for you but you can only do so much in that sauna and you turn it up here I got to get out of something that's a great analogy should I use that okay so the holy place was like a makeup mirror makeup mirror that what you call it in this makeup mirrors that make your face look you see everyone or in your face like a makeup mirror enlarging my ego's blemishes instead of dealing with the blemishes I paraded around like an arrogant Prince
yes when David was crushing to that false ego and on a few occasions it had me almost jumped the fence back to my old world of my our world Evolution indominus shook me to the core and made me face off with some serious demons I had no idea what living inside me I didn't end up jumping the fence but I was moving on from that sacred Vortex to stand in the National League East Calcutta cooler name still the joy experience in my dom was the highest was of the highest caliber I relished new heights of realization is the flowers the beauty of seeing other Soul Seekers on their path and the sweet people that loved me took care of me and inspired me over those four months
 I would not soon forget it Dusty that the dusty town that be
a magical home habits that I've formed their Rising early Channing and meditating singing dancing with the wreck the rest of my life
 free My Mind of media consumption and sex was a genuine relief a note challenge whatsoever no I would not ever forgive her and oven as a flying bird never forgets The Nest that provides the deepest sense of Comfort Inn on Cocoa. It would be a more palatable dose of the medicine okay so so that gives us a hint and you know what we'll read about in the chapters are in Dobbin that there's going to be a lot of really wonderful experiences and wonderful people and there's also going to be that inner struggle that you were going to this is where the book begins and then you'll see how that they're connected so chapter 1 India 1988
 when was hybrid then when you're on that trainer
book somewhere so just as I sat on the third class train to Calcutta steady repetitive sound of iron Rios meeting the track of the Indian Railway reminded me of a train for the 1930s right out of an episode of The Little Rascals which I watched as it could you have to go there to one of those little rascal episode I think she was probably as old as those episodes it needed a good power washing some bleach but it was still exponentially more intriguing than the Metro-North train I used to take from Westchester to New York City this was this was a punk rock train a total mess like Indian 1988 functioning chaos and yet at the same time this country had seemingly millions millions of social religious and superstitious rules and I didn't understand as an outsider
 from my perspective India
hot mess Express with deep spiritual values it was a lot like me
 I got to India in September 1988 when I was 22 years old my father had just died after being in a coma for three years since I was 14 I've been hanging out on New York City's Lower East Side and playing gigs on weekends and I've been touring with hardcore punk bands since I was 16 the disorder the Lower East Side of my in the early 80s prepared me to feel right at home in India I was a teenage straight edge hardcore yogic vegetarian on a quest for truth
 God and otherworldly love love with a capital l internal forces were pushing me to leave my world behind I've walked away from my family my friends my bandmates my fans and my entire music scene I've given my share
 the record company I'd started to my high school friend and partner I told him I had no interest in the music business
after signing 20 bands I went from touring the United States with my hardcore band used it today to being in an to being all in to being an all-in orthodox Hindu monk well almost all in my excitement and determination vacillated daily especially in those early days I lost faith in the material world yet there was so much data to digest that how the culture of ancient Indian met modern-day Indian Society the philosophy in the lifestyle was so foreign to me
 I didn't lament giving up my previous Life as a front man in return I received the greatest gift I could give myself a rebirth a clean canvas a chance not to reinvent myself but you uncover what was already inside of me I didn't go to Indy to put on a Hindu costume I got into Vedic teachings to uncover all the costumes I've been wearing and find out what I was at my core
that's what you were that's what drove you to go there
 yeah for sure I wasn't really interested in joining a religion per se I was really interested in I understood the demons the the, Kuroda Low by Mohawk lush green anger and V that covered the cell and I knew their I knew they were almost like
 like we use that analogy of the horses pulling the chair at their store like wild horses but they were pulling me and I knew I was the me I knew I was the me that was helpless by these forces so I thought underneath the urges of the of the mind there's got to be some peaceful being under there and what is that peaceful be or am I just am I just cemented to my desires in my in my in my hopes and my
am I the Lamentations and Mae Anne in the tubs of my senses so yeah I was there at my car for sure spiritual like I was already on a spiritual Quest that was doing it like you said walking around New York City and reading the book and sit in the park and then pontificating and sharing with Friends at a coffee shop and then going back into my world and then but when you're in
 you're in the container of that Holy Place everything becomes magnified the other people and other is sometimes other Egos and other end and should have like you don't have that you're almost like it so it's like you're in boot camp when you're in an ashram is what you doing today okay. Just okay and and in it and there was no material Comforts nothing to lean into it let's let's get to that in a minute cuz we're about to read
forget about that but just on this topic you know what sense is if I can come in and beige thing because like you know you're you're coming through your teens and into your early twenties and you trying to find your who you are and what your place in life isn't and it is just occurs to me reading that
 that when your teenager you don't know you really don't know very much of anything and you're trying to figure it all out
 and you made this kind of drastic move
 but that you know I'd imagine I know like in my own life and I'm sure and yours is like a lot of times people are looking at the kids see what's wrong with him
 like you know why is he happy or why isn't he you know what why why is it getting into the weird stuff that he's getting into
 and it appears like the most
 people that aren't there they those people appear strange or a misguided or diluted in some way but really
actually
 digging into the meaning of life like those are the real philosophers you not just in the Naches armchair philosophers but like they're actually trying to transform their lives in some meaningful way just do what you know what made it worse was perhaps if I told my family and I didn't you could imagine if we are growing up in Italy and then you tell your parents you know what I'm on a quest for God I'm going to join the Catholic church and they're like okay son we were hoping you get married and you don't have children but good luck on your priesthood yes Dad it was known to be a Hindu monk a Krishna monk it was so far into our culture in the 80s before the internet before the information age and just with a bunch of
 you know picture your
 call 32 years of Notions it was very culte in the seventies and therefore
it was it was not like I'm not only not doing a good thing it was like your ad you're giving up all your friends or family for these weirdos are you crazy it's like at the same time I'm going and fighting guess all my demons for 22 year old person to give up illicit sex intoxication and Etc. It's not even like to your your phrasing that way which is actually get but even just to try to understand that what is the meaning of this what is the purpose of this life you know like sure and so I think that like sure it's common that people might go through that in their teenage years but I think people are going through that like a lot of our listeners are going through that at all different ages you know I'm it might hit in when you 35 or 40 in your life is got to be something more to this in the go through the exact same thing where people will look at them is it what's wrong with this person sure they're losing touch here they're not focus on the right thing
but it's actually is it just appears when when you don't have that inner drive to find something more meaningful people can't necessarily relate to it and if you've been sincerely praying to God for years saying please give me directions please give me truth please give me a path and then it shows up in this package other way as I didn't want this package is there another package God I can't yell at God appearing to me in this particular package when I just been praying for a path there be a different outfit haircut more respected whatever Dodie but I got it I asked for that and that's what that's the package claim one came okay part of what comes out is like it once since you could have asked for more than four diving
like you know what I'm saying it's like it came not even once since you had came in this totally alien kind of package but also when you got into that package and saw it all it's like my God this is the most beautiful culture I've ever seen him last night he knows for sure for sure and then try to explain that it was very difficult to explain to anybody any of my friends any of my family members and you know in that you young enthusiasm you try desperately to explain it and they have more he explained it the crazier they think you are so you continue you said I didn't go to Indy to put on a Hindu costume I got into vacation some cover all the costumes I've been wearing to find out what I was at my core the sacred literature of India explain this in a way they gave me the broadest understanding of spirituality I'd ever had
 I was ready to dive into the ocean of devotion living in India with all its color
sensing raw Beauty I went straight to Christmas Holy Land Randolph and where Krishna the young coward boy the origin of all 33 million demigods
 the Supreme personality had resided five thousand years ago in his manifestation on Earth the place was still alive by Burnt totally inspiring but then only a few months later I left for David feeling like a loser because I couldn't make the cut the power that Holy place in his holy people created a detoxifying fact a purging but I found the transformation to confrontational I faced off against too many inner demons to quickly I became critical rude intolerant arrogant and defensive I lost perspective senior monks encouraged me to leave in Dobbin and go to an ashram and Calcutta and perhaps visit the holy place of my poor a few hours north of the city so could you just tell us a little bit about that like what we doing
go around wrecking things and flipping over. I can't take it anymore I think that's what was happening that you know the weather the food I love the example of the sauna it's just the sauna it's just like you know it's good for you and then it's it's it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter in your drinking water and you're getting hotter and you're sweating final like I got to get out of here that's what happened I always remember you telling the story when you did your first overtime prick remind everybody's just you know which is a 21 km of barefoot walk and everybody else is just like it couldn't be a more bliss and in here like everyone is not my fault that's been going on a governor on brickroom and it starts up beautiful as a full moon
walking around go over downhill at night is my gorgeous it's crowded in in like a communal sort of way but I didn't know a thing and dancing how big can a he'll be singing songs and so I went to a Swami ji there and got some can I hold your book bag for you and I'm going to hold this big book bag and for some reason I'm carrying my own book bag and carrying stuff try to be of service to other people and then sitting under that Moon that moon at we share with you know my mother is also looking at the moon that night the same Moon I'm sharing with my mother and now I'm looking at that Moon and I think it was hard
 but I separated myself from everybody for my entire world my entire Community I'm on the other side
the planet literally and figuratively and I made it and I'm here with the moon and the in these people endeavoring in a spiritual path and this you know beautiful Hill and these beautiful people in that you know and so I was feeling that release like you've been released from prison the prison of your own mind
 but slowly as I'm walking around this hell I realize how long is this hell how long does this go on for as I could be there 20 minutes so and I'm not used to walking barefoot I am in a white high top sneakers you know and thick socks so the more I'm walking the more and then it's night time and you like stubbing your toe and I slashed my toe open so walking barefoot with the bloody tone India that is a recipe for every like tropical
these I could ever think of cuz I've been picturing her sights climbing through my bloodstream and I was like okay this isn't good this can't be good might owe my wet toe is covered with dirt I'm stepping in puddles god-knows-what to that bottles are feces or whatever and is going on and on I'm still trying to keep a good mood now the book bags that I carry you're cutting into my w like burning me the pain for my feet from walking barefoot is going higher and higher way big deal it's it's going to be a little longer than Harry Krishna. Hey I'm feeling good and suddenly I start going to like the back of the line is probably 20 people you know a bunch of monks up front you know and women would baby carriage is sort of like to roll up behind even the women with a baby carriage there passing me out I'm going slower and slower hey miss shooting up towards my butt and finally I see every
play in the distance way ahead of me and they're all sitting down
 and the Swami gets up on a mission he says okay everybody in about an hour will be at the halfway point and at that point my head is loaded I thought they must have been done by now we're not even at the halfway point and that's when I had a total meltdown and I just started getting angry and resentful and thinking how can I get out of here and was that like did that definitely lead to what you're writing about here like
 what I wanted to point out in this book especially was when you read journey home or autobiography of a yogi those books you know the autobiography of a Yogi Yogi Yogananda ghosted him like I never want to leave it all right. Swami goes to you know Rishi K she's like oh I'm going to Holy place I'm going to fast for 30 days
sleep under a tree I'm going to throw my clothes in the ganga but not everybody has that type of spiritual fortitude and stamina I got their nose like this at the best place on Earth and the next day I was like I hate the world I hate myself I hate myself bring it in the world and you just end it but it when it does show is that oh I get it I'm living in my mind and if I can't get over this roller coaster is up and down of the Mind the Seesaw of the mind I'm never going to be happy even when I'm doing what I want to do I chose this I want to do this but I'm just letting a little things tick me off so I know for the most part
 I left but the same point I thought you know what
 I doubt the highs as well as the lows in the when I look back in retrospect
it's exactly what I needed to continue my journey I need to get a very sweet tasting bring job and can do that to me to eat two any two anymore since your soul but also it also gives you this FYI you're not qualified a lot of work to do here you got a lot of work to do and that's what you don't realize they just think I'm so spiritual why is the why is the world fighting so much you know but the fact is we're not as spiritual as we like to think we are and it does hold the makeup mirror to the face and realize all your blemishes this is what you this is how you kind of concluded that part you said so there I was on that third class training feeling crestfallen after shaking off my bad attitude about this unexpected change of location I decided to do something radical
 I shipped in my purse
I exclaimed my life is in God's hands I move forward on my physical and spiritual journey which is both an internal and external picture so so that principle it seems like that's been a principal that probably in your life if you keep coming back to maybe this was your first real
 you know you did the first time or life really made you just kind of surrendering that way right you know what I can't control everything in my life is in God's hands is a beautiful place to be when you realize you can't control it you got an idea of what you'd like to do but you can't control it and sure an end and getting on that train you realize I can't control this either as the train breaks down for 11 hours and I still funny people in that time especially in India who really understand this concept that we can't control things
 I think it'll say later in that in that chapter for the next chapter how the train bro
25 hour train train trip and that the monks I'm traveling with her asking are asking more people to sit with us it's like let's make this trip more uncomfortable us I got you guys kidding me for 25 hours there's no AC there is a high wind tunnel of hundred degree are pumping Through the Windows and you were going to invite more people onto our see that holds three are you kidding me and and then I'm in my brain I'm thinking like one can't get worse than this the train breaks down in a field for 11 hours in those days when there's I don't know if it's still it doesn't seem like it's still like that but it would stop and you don't know how long it's going to stop for no one's got an answer cuz I got two days we might be two days in a field
everything was like that but something about that India Circa 1988 everything I'm going to mail a letter today to my family back in America they may never get it like nothing you could depend on it and I might have to wait four hours to get a stamp to put on the letter yeah you could go to the center of the village to make your phone call and they and they patch you through to debt maturity to Dale and they still might not be there on the other side too and receive it there is something very very beautiful about destitution and surrendered instead were serious and surrender to God because you have no other shelter and just say okay
 okay let's read another section this this and have to do with face this a whole different time this is before that time you're in your band and you're in Southern California so uTorrent
he's got a feel for what it's like that or I was into it you or you just you just had you're just getting some at you're obviously
 interested in spirituality and you'd obviously heard about Krishna Consciousness just to the hardcore scene but you hadn't had so much direct contact with it I sure and so you're in Southern California today perform in Southern California I was staying with Zack de la Rocha who would later helped form Rage Against the Machine but wasn't yet famous
 at his parents house in Irvine Zach was a fan of used it today and at one point said we'd inspired him to go vegetarian he was 17 and I was 20 he was incredibly talented fun and thoughtful and we shared a liking for fast hardcore music stage diving and losing ourselves in the moment I was always looking for new vegetarian restaurants and I knew there was Christian Temple Laguna Beach about 35 minutes away. Had a small budget
Cafe inside so we headed there one day we walked so this is a Laguna Beach temple which we still visit today sure has a temple there great Community there for that time the front foyer and the gift shop was a vegetarian Cafe so is open during the week and it was great as great little place you said we walked into the cafe in. Into the mysterious Temple which is a small the charm which was small the Charming situated a block from the Pacific Ocean we decided to go in before we ate we kicked off her shoes and had a glimpse of the Altar and paintings it was an old church painted brightly and Tastefully yet it didn't have the gravity and gloominess of some of the churches I've grown up in there no cues was an open checkered floor like a chessboard there were massive paintings on the walls to pick in the life Jay Tonya the kirtan Avatar so I didn't know who he was at the time the paintings were mesmerized
student gaze at them trying to figure out what was going on the deities on the altar. Foreign to me there are five beautifully carved statues of men some had their hands in Namaste While others had their hands in the air
 I didn't really understand him to DD's but their presents was Bold and Beautiful it felt holy the temple was pretty much empty with the library of sacred books on the Shelf interview process on or seat for the speaker with some cushion stacked up against the wall I could smell the incense that it burn there perhaps a few hours ago it was a sensational experience in every sense of the word my senses were experiencing something otherworldly with artwork see all through the smells and sounds of music and Munch is playing softly in the background although I was touring writing and recording records my life Direction seem confused I was being creative prolific and spreading a good message but I wanted to have Depp's whizzed
purpose I was over being a frivolous child you sure you're entirely over being a fruitless child's right now I'm totally over it we put out our shoes and went back into the cafe where we grab the tray and headed to the buffet picking out a salad curried vegetables basmati rice and some Hmong doll and a small dessert
 I want now this is interesting right this is where you at it's just sounds to me like when I read this. I just this is where the part of my mind runs hard was saying to do something do something or take another right sure that you said would just eat at the cafe that I wondered if they would let me experience a night in the temple a young monk walked out and I asked him who ran the place he pointed to an older man with light brown hair in a tuft of a ponytail in the back of his head the older Christian devotee had a grave sweet face and was wearing a hooded
Richard in an Indian rolled a nice combination of eats East Meets West so this was our friend to this day right a friend and not his friend but just like he's an exam great example to a great example great kirtan leader great ability his name is Hari whose name is about a hyperbole humble a deep deep deep is this man here comes out and it's okay so you said excuse me are you in charge here
 he said yes he said and gave me a sweet smile could I stay here overnight to see what it's like I'm visiting from New York for a while and I'm interested in eastern thought and spirituality you look me up and down and knotted yeah sure my name is butter Hari do you want to come back tomorrow and stay overnight sure I said surprised at how easy that was that's the wedding Prospect
Zack and I
 went back to his parents house are you sure you want to do this yes yes I said what's the Worst That Could Happen called indoctrination maybe he joked kidnapping castration perhaps I had it already calling me laugh and the next day he dropped me off with my small backpack at the temple door on Legion Street Laguna Beach okay now this is this is what happens in this isn't I met the temple elder brother Harry and invited me in to help him do some work in the kitchen washing pots I was up for anything and started washing them with a V and I asked you a question I asked while he was cutting vegetables sure Ray how do you believe all this stuff it's a big pill to swallow God is a blue Cowherd boy is life on other planets there's a sun god a moon God a wind God how we supposed to turn off our rational minds and just accept all this pain.
I mean we're adults I trailed off thinking I was being profound I thought I was such a diva is it what do we know Ray he asked seriously he stopped cutting what do we actually know a small ant was crawling along the counter near where I was cutting do you see that Aunt I know how do you think that aunt knows where in a temple do you think that aunt knows you have blue jeans on
 or that were blocked from the ocean do you think that aunt knows that I shook my head no he said it's all real though you are wearing blue jeans and we are in a temple and we are near the ocean what is beyond the ants perception to understand it even though he's right next to us he's right here and he's clueless he doesn't have the capacity to understand even though we are right in front of him
 I knew where he was going with this and
we are those ants Ray he said arrogant we think we know everything but we're clueless we guess speculate come up with theories but we're like ants ants with theories trying to figure out what is beyond our sense perception we're trying desperately to get perfect knowledge with are in perfect and like census The Vedic teachings give us a clue into reality reality is fantastic it's not ordinary you pause white adjusted what he said no one is asking you to accept those fantastic things and very teachings were not looking for blind followers this isn't faith based its experience-based teachings we ask you to bring your discernment your intelligence your doubts and then enter the experiment so to say yes Ganesh is definitely an elephant-headed being who scribe The Vedas might sound like Blind Faith
 but you say he doesn't exist and you know that for sure.
blind out how do we know we are like ants how do we know if Canasta consists how do we know if he doesn't exist the safest thing to say is he could he could exist I don't know but he could cuz I know very little so I tend to focus on things I do know like what I asked and this is an interesting part of the book you said like what I ask what do you actually know about this philosophy and what can you say you know for sure
 I know it's good to control my senses instead of indulging them I Know Jack that makes sense I know that Rising early and taking cold showers is good for my health in that meditation is good early in the morning he said and I know that I don't want to kill animals for food because they suffer tremendously I kept nodding I know that I'm not in control of my life I have some control but I don't have complete control I know there's a limit to my sensory perception what do you mean for example my ears cannot hear what a dog can eat
there colors that cannot see my senses are limited in subjective like the ants I also know that that chanting has an effect on my Consciousness it affects me profoundly this I know from experimenting with it I know that the sounds that come out of my mouth both negative and positive affect me and my environment if I gossip it affects me if I speak kindly it affects me I know that the Gita is a book of wisdom I can understand that I am a spirit who has a body I can witness my body changed since he's Transformations I started to see his point so yes in small increments we move forward with face constantly questioning I get it I said but it's hard I'm just filled with so much skepticism and doubt you're a doubter the sermon is good but be careful doubters stay paralyzed
 in business relationship
even in the spiritual life use discernment ask question but be careful with too much doubt it or if you're going to doubt he paused why not just doubt your doubts but a great one smile Dallas my doubts that sounds like it was an important lesson for you that your doubts it's the analysis paralysis that teach people from just moving forward in anything you can over-analyzing over and ultimately got to take if it makes sense even just a little then take a little step forward if it makes sense a lot take a bigger step forward
 but you got to enter the experiments
 Russia couldn't get no result when I write by the way a shooter said that his while you're a cheetah and Andre
 Andres Andres
 Andres book literally arrived
the student is reading from it now okay
 so I'll let's let some jump forward a bit now okay now you've now you've spend the night in an ashram
 then jump back in your band and towards some more ended up back in New York and you still pursuing these ideas and in you write some really you right about a lot of interesting times you had talked about me tripping on mushrooms now are we going to the mush I wasn't going to go there but I can if you'd like to do want to do that whatever you like
 what you know in one sense that leads into what I was about to read let's see if we can hang out for now I was going to go. Whatever you like I was going to go to a place where you meet someone that becomes really important. Now you're back in New York and you did right
about your you're searching that you're going through there and the book said you were reading in the people that you're meeting in the experiences that you're having working and in terms of romance and in terms of your band in in in all of these things in the whole thing was just kind of you know a big stew you know where your true word like all these things are Blended together and you're trying to find you tried like you could try to reach out and find that
 that rope that something to hold onto the kind of pull you into the next stage of your life in order
 and one place where that leads you after after meeting you know grew figure who is kind of like really exciting in the beginning but disappointing in the end and you know bouncing back and forth seen things that impressed you and things I didn't pressure you end up in another Hari Krishna Temple this one's in Brooklyn in New York
you got understand I've already been to this Krishna Temple but it was almost like an impenetrable wall there like I would never go and like no one would notice me I remember if you are you're doing a lousy job of showing up on a regular basis and no one will even speak to me it's a great idea what's going on here because your yard you describe an attempt on your describing you get a nice descriptions you can you help bring people into that world and I want Santa's not so different than what it's like that you can walk into the temple and get a similar experience smell the same smells and see the same sites even sure how you know 4 years later whatever but what you really needed was someone to talk to and I really yeah it and someone that you could talk to wear there
 I don't want to eat and maybe it's the wrong word to use but in a sense their indoctrination
wasn't too much of a of a of a wall to get over for you needed someone that could speak to you in a language that was relatable someone that could speak your language that's what it is it in like it's the relatable person who's who's imbibed it can translate it for you. Otherwise it stays still cryptic yeah
 so keep going for a little bit longer so you said as I walked out the back door of the temple into the front lobby there were tables covered in books and snacks spicy pork or samosas in Indian sweet. Remember that hundreds of books piqued my interest and you list some of the different books and then one of them is called food with spirit vegetarianism and world religions by Steven Rosen
 it presented how poor dumb and you were already
kind of like in your band kind of like promoting vegetarianism big-time I was a big-time spoke smokes Advocate and you know outspoken outspoken preacher of that are so that's going to catch your eye it presented how prominent world religions are supposed are all supported a restricted diet when it came to animal conception it was filled with facts quotes in scripture references that I use when endorsing animal rights among religious people who consumed meat in the wondered if the author was part of this sect of the Christian Community see I thought you already had that I had purchased this book at Wiser's which was a metaphysical bookstore so you are already familiar with that was all it was my favorite book my favorite book and when you that today put out a record its final record I wanted to write a book list of books I've read that are remote vegetarianism
there weren't that many out there the ones that I knew it yesterday I put this one on the album jacket and it was before I even knew the author right okay so now you're at this Hari Krishna Temple there's that book that you're so into I wondered if the author was part of this sect of the community or the option just carry the book then I noticed a tall man standing clothes. Over my shoulder give me dress conventionally in a Blazer and jeans I immediately recognized his smile from the back of food for the spirit
 hi I said you're the author I use your book constantly I'm a vegetarian and animal-rights supporter your biggest fan is a fantastic resource I'm so honored and excited to meet you are you a Christian or two yes definitely he replied you don't look like one by the way you're dressed I said our spiritual life has little to do with the way we dress and more to do with what's in her head and heart would you agree
 good answer I thought
smart how do you say I'm going to buy food for the spear for my friend Marion can I ask your spirit can I ask you a spiritual question about basic teachings sure there seems to be a discrepancy in the different tradition some worship God is a personal deity in some is formless it seems Reckless to dive into a tradition before getting to the bottom of this what does the Traditions say about personal or impersonal facets of God so I was already going to different yoga you know communities yoga ashram and this was a topic of book D topic the mukti this type of topic of boxy cuz I go which is it is God and energy or is God a being and it seems like everybody here worships goddess of being but how do you even have the intelligence to discern in a which one is for me okay so he replies so you said what does the beta Traditions say about personal or impersonal fat
they are both she replied simply how could God be both isn't got either one of the other
 and then he replies is the sun different from the sun's Rays yes I said and then I caught myself well yes and no which is if he poked can you separate them from each other I guess you can't have one without the other but in one sense they are different like if I say the sun is in the room I'm not talking about the planet I'm yes exactly said they are different and they are 11 is the sun globe in one of the energy this son not the wrong but it's looking at the truth God or our higher power from a different vantage point if I'm looking at a drawing of a number 94 not a piece of paper my telligence accepted as a 9 if a person across me see the same drawing power from his perspective it's a six or seen the same thing from a different Vantage points Only Fools will say I say
6in you're wrong or I see 9 and you were wrong this misunderstanding of Truth through different Vantage points has destroyed spiritual Traditions throughout the world it must be uprooted I had to agree and since that's a great statement is because their dig their heels in and they just hate those who can't see from their own Vantage Point yeah he said that I was like okay it was one of those missing puzzle pieces that you've been waiting for it to almost like to sit upright in the first time in your life for someone just started speaking on another level another platform of spiritual understanding but also triggered play it was the first time that a devotee of this Temple are this community it really made sense to me cuz I was going to this Temple for a while. Just didn't make any sense I don't know why there was something that was keeping you around
it was the first I was like I can relate to this person I think I might have even said that to him I might have said you know luck your normal ever I don't find anybody else normal here but yeah I like it like like you do it so you are inspiring you want to ask me another question so you guys could I could I ask you some more questions he said sure So she said I've run into a lot of people that say truth is subjective
 there's still today right it's my door maybe more than before that their truth might be different for my truth they say that truth is in the mind of the beholder and that there's no such thing as absolute truth so he responds so they say without a doubt the subjective you a smiley that Ray is an absolute statement we both laughed so God makes so much God that makes
since I said look right you seem bright people who argue that we all have our own truth are fooling themselves they cannot live with good conscience that's like saying Adolf Hitler had his true let him do what he wants Pol Pot Mussolini Stalin have their own truths let them be is there truth know that makes no sense whatsoever there is truth and there is illusion there is love and there is hate there is light and there is Darkness I nodded he was right there had to be a gold standard of Truth for all people all secret that was not bound by Nation cultural religion
 people also argue that there's no right or wrong you said you believed that he asked no I said there must be people are fools he said they say they'll say anything to justify doing whatever the hell they want to do of course there's a right and wrong or are they saying the kidnapping and human trafficking okay
he smiled at how ridiculous people could be in the name of deep philosophical thinking good luck living that reality and you know it in in hearing this you know it does remind me of you know when I was more lesson in your shoes and meeting this a lot of the same people and hearing the same same argument two answers to the same kind of questions but they were so if it did kind of feel like finally someone is just weird calling out calling it out now there's good and bad the ring right around there is light and darkness there was something about Krishna consciousness
 that we met people that just were ready to answer any question that we threw out of them in it and the Fuso consistent the pieces kept fitting together so well that puzzle piece fits that puzzle piece fits yeah yeah and so for you it was especially such a large Steven Rose in that that put those pieces together for you
spoke spoke with language never forget that forget that bromancing of Krishna and who Christian is sends to speak your language to you well as Jay Shetty rights on the cover Rugrats transformation shows that one person's choice to evolve can change the lives of so many I think you have been through this book will continue to put a lot of those pieces together with the people I congratulate you on right by your blessings Preble by your blessing will accomplish when people go out and get it today where is it please tell people where to get it again Mara punked a monk a monk a monk a monk
