 Mall Monday alright you ready for nugget yeah
 is there made it so easy custard we made it so easy to be a Hare Krishna the Enchantix except that people who didn't 2.0 it's so easy. Brummett eardrum questions for perfect answers he said he was the first guest
 cuz they just bought this Big Field which is Maya pour I put them in my drawer in my project is all they had was a field and and it was like a bunch of devotees and he was a guest is that I was the only guests and he was in the Peace Corps at the time he was a young man in the Peace Corps and you have prepared what 1971
1971 and started asking he's really good questions and shama Center was there and show me Sandra said we should record this these are great questions and your answers are so great and probably said make a book review questions or if I Cancers and they made a buck out of it made any Crock-Pot spent all day with him like seven days and did this so he was with us this weekend it was super nice now he's setting up the bucket of The Institute this academic scientific wing of the you know of the are bucking movement and you know it is quite as I'm saying this because in the old days to go to my poor you're sleeping in the grass you're camping out you know you're washing your clothes in a river it was really that made it really easiest for us to go to get mile area right now it's so easy to go to my poor it's like a vacation the holiday
 we're making it easy I mean that were told that book perfect questions perfect answers which is still available you can find it I'm sure
I got one yesterday so it's so that book that was kind of like for people like you and I that was one of those kind of like small paperback books that we read when we first getting into suck this makes so much sense right. Alex's birthday. She read that book to Amazon and get it
 okay here's your nugget today sir very surprised from a me more as a therapist trainer and an international bestselling author AR books in the books in the 13 things mentally strong people don't do Series has sold more than 1 million copies and have been translate into more than forty languages you got a lot of catching up there to do 40 languages run I thought you got so far I've got Danish and Portuguese and English Italy and Germany to publish my book another language just hit me up okay
ever heard of the same anymore but then I checked that she had like a TED Talk I didn't I only saw the beginning of it but it's pretty cool it she's got like it says it's an interesting again I don't I haven't read these books I can't speak to their quality or validity or whatever but dumb you know like this is a contents to 13 things mentally strong people don't to
 they don't waste time feeling sorry for themselves they don't get you should write this book right they don't give away their power they don't shy away from change they don't focus on things that can't control they don't worry about pleasing so it's like it's a 10 what I realized as I began to check her thing out of what she means by mentally strong
 is what we would call like a controlled mind it's actually like determine Focus wanted or or will not distracted or diverted from your own well-being you know it's really if we want to get to when we can't
let's read what she says and we can talk more about the mind and all that is weak and that's why she was the lady from till Tuesday
 I don't even know till Tuesday I'm not till Tuesday okay just because you're struggling with self-discipline doesn't mean you have to raise the white flag and declare yourself Improvement efforts a complete failure
 what's the same as the other day instead work gentle you should write the book instead work to increase the chances that you'll stick to your healthier habits even when you don't feel like it says I think for me that was a little different intonation
 yeah instead work to increase the chances that you'll stick to you still here healthier habits right like that yeah we're to increase the chances that you'll stick to your healthier habits
 even when you don't feel like it cuz it if if it lets say you know that's a I took up the idea of what I want to practice but the end of require self-discipline I do charge control
Santa's not doing a lot of things I used to do maybe we'll be healthy for me you know doing certain things that I haven't done which in the beginning they feel austere but you know they take time before they they really feel more natural and satisfying to you sure Emma and I try and I try to wake up early but I found myself lying around in bed got to go to bed early if I myself staying up and watch television you know things like that her her point was is going to be natural that we struggle to to discipline ourselves but her strategy was set things up in such a way that it will increase your chances to stick to these healthier habits that means like let me begin to construct my life in such a way
 where that kind of behavior is normal eyes to becomes easier or you know like if I want to get up and chant Joppa or early in the morning to my meditation the morning
do I need to do to make that happen I need to get to sleep early you know you're going to get to sleep early what do I have to do so that I'll get to sleep early begin to construct your life
 it in ways that will facilitate the ease of self-discipline and that's really like we're reading on in the Box on now about like these for social orders you know like footboard for different kind of occupations with their with each one with a different responsibilities and ethical codes and then today we're going to read about the four different times in life for you to call the ashram is but the four different stages of life again with with clearly prescribed codes you know ethical codes and in practice in disciplines and instill the idea what there was they were building an entire Society
 where in you would have bet with
increase your chances of sticking to healthier habits right so we might look at it is oppressive
 why are you posing all these codes
 but because they increase our chances of sticking to healthier habits how do you do that in your life right now
 Conway's first of all I think that a big part of this statement is that we tend to live in a world of All or Nothing also used to like throw up there I just can't do this I can't do this in and eat a we have a lot of
 there's a very high bar that is set and we feel like you don't know who knows maybe some Guild or some like we're trying to please somebody or try to please somebody out there please apparent please an older brother plays it a relatively like I got to do what I got to do that high
 and it had hit this idea
perfectionism
 then I just want to want to do it in the shed so we just want to tear down all the rules and just so you know what I mean this isn't the real me guess what you can be in the club even if you can't it's chance you could be in the club even if you can't completely control your senses you could be in the club even if you go to the movies every now and then you can be in the club you can't be priests within the society but you're in this if you have an affection for Krishna guess what you're in the club and people just feel like I can't do this and that ended their own shame kicks in so don't throw in that white flag it's not Perfection its progress we have this Perfection attitude or else I don't even play
 just make a little progress and progress and you know like we're not like you you're commonly uses terms like Hari Krishna 2.0
early on and you know of course the Harry Christner movement as an expression of a ancient tradition going back so many centuries
 body kind of landed in the Western World in the 60s and 70s and it's it became a particular expression of that ancient tradition and the end in a kind of grew in a particular way and some of those
 I don't know
 trends
 could feel very primitive and so 2.0 me is kind of saying like what you know we always got to focus on the essence we got to see where it all goes and do whatever we can to help someone move for supper isn't if you got into this Krishna bhakti back in 1975 cuz you someone presented a bug of agita to you in a parking lot somewhere at a rock concert or something like that and you were to George Harrison George Harrison wrote the introduction in your read the book in your like this is great
I'm totally into this it's likely that you would have gotten the impression or been you know Steer towards the idea of dropping everything in your life moving into a temple becoming a monk or like a female monk end and Diving All In Like A full-immersion nowadays we don't have people doing that very much but we need to see that they're still getting the essence of the practice and that's I think that's a large part of our challenge of bringing Bucky into them into the next century and in really facilitating people with the frizz sense if you moved in that Temple you be told you need to chance 16 rounds of job you meditation is basically minimum 2 hours of meditation on this month's truck and a lot of people that are getting in the bucket out just do not going to move into Temple and their Lifestyles going to make it
 challenging to do that especially in the beginning when you have no you may have very little taste for you know that taste some of that develops gradual but exactly is your saying it if you feel a sense
Self Defeat because I I can't do these two hours a day or two I struggle to do it I do it and it's almost like points because I'm watching because I can't concentrate when I'm do it then we just need to say then let's get you to Chan a minimum that's less than that and we'll build our way up to that and just trying to let you know be intelligent about how we go about it I was with the chief this weekend the chief or hanging out of the morning that she just goes I'm going to chat my one good round today okay the one girl you know what and I'm okay with that he's okay with that devotees 2.0 devotees are very very understanding to point out the bodies were like maybe that should be our next march for the 2.0 devotees
when you're always welcome to come as you are and try to rest and okay and we should encourage each other always to to do better but it's just being being thoughtful and how we apply that we should try to create circumstances that increase our chances to stick to our health you have it we just need to be thoughtful about how we do it

 start a new chapter today brother chapter 12 and the name of the chapter is the perfect Society for Spiritual classes
 this will especially have to do with the four ashrams brahmacharya sure on which we could call celibate Student Life
 grihastha Asha which is married life vanaprastha
which is kind of retiring for more spiritual you know more spiritual focus and Insidious which is like the full renunciation at the end
 no again until Herman Student life is like the opposite of students nowadays is a B students what's the best party school in California I know
 text number one is often quoted prophetic wrote this for so long I think you and I might do a little reminiscing of our Bromwich our days here today right now at brownies and Float meetings in the flow really did all that stuff I don't know what is a class officer you know I was at the class in a class class Treasurer how does a class Treasurer how did you into that position
I was popular in high school they go did you into that position like you convince people that you they should trust their money with you
 yes
 I can't believe you had like a campaign and and all that really do is to me like a hard core and all that stuff for like diametrically opposed somehow you found a way to
 doing both somehow day I didn't both rally the football homecoming and you bring a car and I was in the marching band we're proud of our school colors and yeah I can picture it all fitting together. You missed out on your sousaphone excitement Lower East Side half and glue it was not huffing glue everyone around me was all right all right
let's let's split this conversation quickly from glue huffing to glue huffing self-discipline I've never young age by the way good for you
 Natalie said a student should practice completely controlling the senses
 they should you remember this first from a cherry grape Kool-Aid Vachon Dental good or he come I never met you never memorize this one
 he should be submissive and should have an attitude a firm friendship for the spiritual Master yeah that's that's happening in high school firm friendship or their teachers that are trying to give you discipline yeah with great value the brahmacharya should live at the gurukul only for the benefit of the guru it's such a different mood it's like the students are entitled the TalkBack there's no there's no submissive inquiry that's how you grow healthy sparring challenge at a buffet
tell me this and have a healthy debate but it's like there's just the flippant students tend to be flippant, even more than flippant Source in my opinion violence how do you show me how many teachers are violent now it's flipped her yeah well they still swap the kids that's what my friend told me in any case setting all that aside here we get a picture with this of course the sage Naruto is now speaking to the great king you to steer
 they're both like deeply spiritual people you just your has all this heavy responsibility on his head to to act for the good of society this is what he's thinking I need I need all the advice and insight that I can get
in order to order Society in such a way will people will be more likely to stick to the healthier habits and there's a there's a traditional way that's done that comes through the beta right it's like when we understand that what where is this all coming from the ideas that
 this age Jazz Diva you know this knowledge called the beta that's Eternal right and it's kind of just like vibrating through the universe it's there it's like just like the radio waves I like that that are always the right equipment to access them
 answer the right equipment with the sages had that through meditation that they could access this knowledge that is vibrating to the universe that is not different from God that is like it was
also speaking it there speaking to be what but but but I took it in he didn't hear it from anyone else he accessed it you know it's just through that through the just through the vibration and then he wrote it down he kind of edited it and wrote it down and within that knowledge that Eternal knowledge it's right it's called appreciate its not created by any human being
 but within that knowledge part of it was understanding the different mindsets and the different stages of life and how by following this their use these are useful insights that that individually and as a as in collectively we can move towards deeper spiritual understanding of this is an important little raised here or word a Porsche means it means
cuz people always challenge where is it coming from who made it up someone have a right it there they're trying to like get you down there some like there's some like. I did this and you guys are all following it blindly it's a Porsche it always existed we don't we can't even find a compartment in our brains even understand that always existed at the start no didn't know if it's true that it's almost how would you define the flourish as self-evident operation not from a person I'm not faded purse it's it's it's it's actually a lot of what I've been writing about lately but it has it has to do with
 read a little bit what is ready
 yeah if it could shed light on that word what it's about exactly about that
 okay so the sages have always held that our existence is not an accidental byproduct Arisen out of random interaction of dust and gas
in the dark but that there was an issue that it was intentionally designed and that there was a universal manual that the sage is the universal Manual of the sages was a body when I was called the vet at first this is called Nevada write the word vitamins knowledge followers of the VA to claim that it has no human author it is approved not created by any person they say that the Veda is Supernatural the breath of the Divine that's the metaphor that that use a new polishes that I did is the breath of the Dragon of the Divine I like that its existing eternally in the form of sound vibrating through the universe by means of intense Penance and meditative trance sages became a living receptors of the beta
 as a radio tuned in to the right frequency receives a vibrating signal or as a tuning fork picks up the vibration of another has already been struck say just had the ability to tune in and receive the vibrating knowledge of the cosmos and then tree
admit that message for the good of the others for good and for the good of others
 so that's that's the ideas of Yas you know if we were living in the day before radio just going back couple centuries we would have had such an excellent
 metaphor or analogy right cuz it's if you just think about if you said to someone back that there are ways that are carrying sound and all kinds of information can just float through the universe in with the right receptor you can tap it and pull it out but it's all around us constantly they would like to stop with your mythology and silly idea is that you know that we are that there's booze waves you know it would have made no sense but it was a fact it was true it was true right so so now we can use that as an analogy saying you had their right those waves are right here in this room right now you just need the right receptor to access it seemed really the sage is through them through the mind
can receive this if you know how to do it and you can learn how to do it to penance in austerity and meditation you could become fine-tuned you get better download I've been to it from the iCloud exactly you could download it seems we have this concept of the downloads that's how reading Minds takes place you can actually read another person's mind because it's actually fold floating out there and you can could not only that you could program someone else's mind with your own thoughts
 you can control another person's mind
 yeah but that's what working on here because
The Voice number that does the Krishna boxes like Chiva goswami when he comments on the stronger yoga patanjali
 he he warns us it's really not our path and it's it's it's not advised but his reason was is because when you get deep into it you develop all these powers and when he developed his power is very likely that you just get lost in them I can read minds I can control someone else's mind and I forget about the whole purpose of it all and any case we can help Okay but but in any case you know within that floating Eternal knowledge that one can that that the sages could access the BIOS accessed
 is these instructions about these four stages of life and in it and it selects and when the art is presenting it to you to show he's presenting it in the very traditional sense right if we were going to we do apply this when we apply this in our modern world with the speak of our modern Western World we try to take the
sense of it and adapted to the current circumstances
 when when Naruto speaking to you to show this is thousands of years ago and it is being presented a very traditional it like for instance how the barometer addresses deerskin right like that's what you meant to wear right here you and then for you know people concerned about animals which we appreciate it they would kill the animal to get it but the animals die do they all died and so you would have waited very simple cloth the barometer in any case there's more about that they will get into but picture you pictured this that when you're 8 years old
 you're sent to the home of the guru whether you visited every day or whether you actually kind of live in the ocean with a girl and you're getting training right from that stage yet you're memorizing monstrous right you're you're you're ideally and we get we begin to get a sense of it here
he should he should be submissive would that we say submissive no know when you have love for your Guru right when you when you when there's a teacher in your life that you just have a deep profound respect for and even a deep affection for the natural that submissiveness naturally rises in the heart and it becomes the most if that you provide sometimes uses this analogy that he says just like if a if a woman is fertile and a man is potent than by their Union than a child is born
 and simile is a guru is potent with spiritual knowledge
 and the student is is a fertile to the right attitude in a through a submissive attitude that through with a respectful attitude but we say submissive especially what we made us yes I sent you it's disrespect there then then you become so
getting in the birth of spiritual knowledge in the student it is easy
 you know it's a simple but we live in a world of such a pieocracy that we were were were skeptical that this couldn't even exist and will begin to hear these terms if you can see you're a Cena you should be submissive should have an attitude a firm friendship with mega grade Val should live in the group will only for the benefit of the guru
 but here's the thing you and I kind of live this you know like I feel we very much lived in a spirometer as you know what this whole thing is the lifestyle habits the movie the intention we are creating
 ham radio is my friend you don't have a radio is it was working with radio Studio a ham radio guy to tell the truth did you always say that you said those radios that could like taken signals from like all around the world
radios this is that a ham radio I thought meant that you could become like the guy on the radio but there was another kind of power output and CB radios are you would necessarily become the guy but there's a radio where you could like hear stuff around me from like Europe or yeah you can hear it
 we say anyway ham radio is also know that he has on it at my point is by Behavior by intention by purifying the census by controlling the census by purifying the mind you start pick up
 messages downloads from the Everest is that what you were doing. Is that what you're doing when we were on the trailer and I had no idea that you were like that was downloading various information
whether we know it or not that's what's happening okay if I'm clogged if I'm intoxicated if I'm arrogant nothing's going to come but let's be clear
 we were downloading it from other human beings rather than tapping into the universal vibration hahaha she has a speaking right now and God touches people to talk to you but God behind it that's exactly what I said I never said God wasn't behind it is not just people there's also Revelations coming in when you read sacred literature you hear from people and then also God reveals things in your heart. But I just wanted I just want to be clear of all of our
 then he's just presentation I'm not saying that it's not possible but what I'm saying is generally what we're saying is that vyas downloaded it recorded in his scriptures
like the ones that we read everyday right gurus
 help students understand the import of those scriptures
 and the knowledge gets handed down in it in that kind of chain where we hear it orally from a teacher in through the scriptures that's the foundation of what we're doing here right and I'm not saying that in a ling electing an inspiration that's also God Spire Inspire on I agree with that that's not I'm not denying that right okay. Is in the heart of every living being speaking at any moment talking to me all the time and what are the voices say ham radio is so a ham radio enables communicate
across the city region country continent the world or even into space even into space cuz tuba but there was a name maybe with shortwave I don't know what does the name of of whenever I thought hammer do I thought you could you could you could have radioed ahead this late long wire that would be like your antenna and you could be picking up stuff from all around the world you my friend are squirrel and now okay just was just an LG thank you thank you for setting me straight my squirrel makes you as well thank you and night namely in the early morning and in the evening
 they should be fully absorbed in thoughts of spiritual Master the fire the Sun God and Lord Vishnu and by chanting the Gayatri Mantra you should worship them okay
here in a sense here what years were getting from her nugget right if I'm going to have good habits then I need to kind of standardized what I'm going to do in and create a routine
 and so like you don't both Junctions of the day-night these are considered important Times by the oldies write these junctures up day and night and they're saying let's build into the routine that everyday
 and it now when you're living in the ashram and under the guru's carrots even so much easier to kind of like to stick to these kind of routines that every morning and every evening we're going to sit down and bring our thoughts to to very sacred places to the guru to the fire within the fire represents you know the receptacle of our offerings to Vishnu or that Vishnu was within fire right like within the sun itself to the Sun God and to Lord Vishnu
 and you know how they called
do you know Ryan in the you know that it was a time that I never I was always trying to get to the essence of what is that exactly mean and I did some research you're not oh I want to hear that I love you and like this because Oreo courses the god of the sun
 and then we always ask for addition to enter the fire and a young you is it from you what was my guess this is what I found is that course or you is the god of the sun so when were chanting Gayatri and were meditating on the Sun
 how we meditating on Vishnu because Soria is the god of the sun
 but sure you know Ryan is Vishnu within the heart of Soria within the Sun what we get to do what you don't get to do so much who's we
 whoever's with me okay yeah the other day with me and Hootie and the and the Bombay girl to see the stars
that too but we get to like light fires we are barbecuing barbecuing once you light that fire it's mesmerizing you can see here in the fire
 is mesmerized and they gave me stop gabbing and stop asking crazy kids are bunch of pyromaniac Smith what kind of kids are you okay so you know we we meditate you know both you and I've been given the Gayatri Mantra to chant at these junctures of the day you meditate on the sun you meditate on Lord Vishnu through these mantras and. This is this is part of the the asean lifestyle did you get I can't think of it you're 8 years old
 you get initiated
vintage into the lineage right end and your begin in your giving all these like
 we you and I I need it back we didn't get this when we were kids as a matter of fact we didn't even get any if we didn't even get like any of them would like to ask the questions that you meant to be asking what is like about you with the glue huffers if I was like before that I was with a blue hoppers on a date and end in N even that you know it's kind of like you know you are strong ethical codes deep wisdom it it was just kind of like just play and forget it
 they were getting this from an early age getting such good Impressions deep deep within their in their subconscious mind so much growth could be to imagine if it said watch until you know we will go home after school so watching stupid television shows they would be Channing holy mantra
memorizing easily memorizing the bug of agita easily memorizing yoga sutras the bait on two suture you know downloading all of this kind of just this wealth of information that would improve the quality of their life in so many ways and Gayatri Mantra regularly Chad building that regular Mantra chanting into the routine at these at these parts at this juncture is a day and night where a fundamental part of that what I think is a big also a little interesting side-note is your sandwich in your day here in this important for all of us on the show we have some morning time that's for God is for a self and forgot before we go into the world of you know when we were growing up you wake up with a alarm clock radio number those north of 45 years old you don't remember that radio and wakes you up and it's like some rock and roll is playing and they are your in the day already I can wash your teeth running eat some breakfast shove it in your mouth
door so if you turn on the television right then some people turn on the television The Weather Channel whoever it is but my point is know you need time before you have to get out the door you need time for you and God and that's listen I say for literature that's sitting in meditation that sitting and chanting you're one good round it's reading some verses by the bug of agita when you concur that when you feel like I got this I'm doing it everyday then you take that to the evening before I go to bed I'm going to hear I'm going to chant I'm going to read a story I'm going to even let a lecture go on as I fall asleep or something like that at night but we sandwich our day holy morning holy evening do your work during the course of the day and you will take Lord Vishnu with you through the course of the day it's a simple plan to regulate your mind and your senses
 there you go putting that out there it's it's it's
it's a weight of working to increase the chances that just stick to your healthier habits and ended your help your thoughts fire to fire one of our Zoomers give me Carol she was a fire-eater yes you did so circus stuff by or eating
 just thought I'd share that you can have all the squirrel in nice houses 3 x 3 being called by the spiritual Master the student should study The Vedic mantras regularly every day before beginning his studies and at the end of his studies but discipleship respectfully offer a base of these unto the spiritual master that also sounds wrote perfunctory but it's not we say it all the time we say something I'm too blessed to be depressed right or I'm a grateful
that's my place to do what to be depressed too blessed to press you bless the stress this is the essence of beta teaching we are grateful we're deeply grateful here they just say that we should respectfully offer obeisance he's just walking around balling down Valium down Valley down in our mind we are bowed down in our mind we understand I have so much by the mercy of other people and that's your mentality we feel blessed we feel grateful because we have great teachers and good fortune and spiritual information in our lives in that position because I feel like I'm receiving the stop
 I can't get arrogance and I can't get like all body of the word I could I feel like I'm blessed I'm getting a lot of Mercy I'm getting a lot of Grace So when that mood is there also this stuff to download the download also accelerates it's a quicker
download speeds it opens up the channel to the ticket opens up the channel to the vibrations that you download through your yeah it is like a high-speed internet where they call that they would those wires that they have the hardwired and I know it's like the BIOS whatever anyway just cabled this cable it's not dial either optic if I'm like taking a lot of lot of drugs drink a beer in a regular basis but occasionally it's like it's like a dial-up it's like but I've heard it was so exciting wasn't it
 are you stressing right now is that yeah we get triggered by the stuff we didn't like our teachers we had a lot of bad experiences in school I like
maybe my parents are good for you but when we think about this idea of being submissive to a teacher beat showing all of this
 respect even you know the offering obeisances to them and what they speak of like living for them to live solely for the benefit of the way it sounds it can sound so far but I do believe that we all have a desire for this in our life it's a particular type of love
 you know that that's that's there is it supposed to particular Flavor of Love Desi arase right if there's a certain flavor of love in it and when we see it front from our Western perspective when we see it in popular culture a lot of times it's going to the east to find it you know like the karate kid or something like that right there's a graffiti even even like Yoda is basically model after like an Eastern Guru you know
sounds like what you know or you know that there's another one was at that film Kill Bill
 where are we going to likes the the star of it the protagonist is a woman that goes to Japan to learn how to sword fight and she's got like a guru there that's some
 never said something like my girls like it incredibly Stern and I don't know punishing is the right word like your kind of cutting cutting hounding yeah like life very difficult to satisfy and please demanding demanding you know but she wins the heart of that grew through her submissiveness because she knows he's got the knowledge that I seek and and and there's a meaning to this discipline by which that it is not cheap what they're giving you know it's not cheap and
this is so I'm entering into a serious tradition and and I and I respect that and I eat and I'm willing to accept the guru's method of instruction and through that she won won the heart of the guru you know it ends in received the knowledge and the end in the art from him so I think we we do it within us to see even a romantic vision of that type of love and I think we desire to it but it's but unfortunately many of us may go a whole life without ever finding even one relationship that they really has that
 that flavor
 I can figure out a time I can be your heavy Guru you know it can you benefit to help you a chopper says that this body helps is reconcile
the concept of authority maybe we need to reconcile with concept of authority bit organized all of a sudden I definitely did an in-depth where can I get I do have to continue and I can help you to Linda Linda Linda what are our takeaways today but who got more takeaways me and I've got some good ones I didn't keep track of who said what though so I have that will facilitate the ease of self-discipline the only requirement to be in this club is an affection for Krishna
