 I'm on my way back to Recovery Group meetings at 12 and 9 p.m. eastern time and we also have back to Recovery Group meetings in person and Nashville Alachua and my bar in New York City
I said something really nice about you in class today and we've been cute doing Q&A all weekend and it's Monday we did start a little late today at 8 but we're going to dive in right back to the bog with Tom that's all going to do a nugget to nugget first yeah and here's the Nugget in this is from one of our favorite Wagner Tom holders
 give me the quote the Bible Tommy just quoted is introspective inside there was Marcus Aurelius the stehlik Roman ruler and he said people who labor all their lives would have no purpose to did wrecked every thought and impulse
 okay let me try that again people labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought an impulse
Ford are wasting their time even when hard at work
 not saying you shouldn't work hard now it's just saying when it's not directed towards anything it's just
 running a race that has no destination in life has to have a Central purpose essentially that identify what it is I think a lot of self-help gurus even get into things like you need purpose what is your purpose what is the Y that you're waking up 4 in the morning and inbox you say that too but we take it bigger cuz sometimes wise while I'm going to raise my family or I'm going to work on my business I'm going to get really dialed into my career and we say all that's good
 but its secondary make your connection the highest and use your breath your thoughts your work your love your friendships your holidays your vacation
your make it all diving into that direct white and it gives you the inspiration to wake up in the morning and we're in our morning class today which I recorded by the way thank you. Everyday tells me record class and every day I didn't like
 can I forgot was going to say but the idea was that you gave a class give a class talk about some great stuff
 I can't remember that
 yes I can remember. Thank you for your encouragement
he said I want to start one which is you know like in spiritual circles or so-called spiritual circles or quasi spiritual circles you know there's sometimes you hear this kind of messages like there should be no goal but it's all about the journey.
 Nothing valuable in that it in other words yeah we should learn dead like we're not just waiting to achieve something in the future and that in the now there's you know in the now we should be very aware and an in touch but the idea that there's no goal that you should be so detached that there's no goal that's not actually like an authentic yogic idea sure that's that's like a quasi spirits in the material world they have to like pendulum the other way so you know there is no going
it's not they were just meant to become detached from everything so that there's absolutely no goal where there's no aspiration there's no target that we're aiming at but is that we're supposed to be detached from the things that prevent us from keeping that focus and it is called the Perfection of Desire because desire you know we understand how man it's my desires that I've been causing me so much chaos in my life my desires have been only me here before him there I've got to get rid of desires but we can't get desires all you can do is refined your desire so we say stop Desiring matter that won't fulfill our hearts start Desiring Spirit just it's redirecting that urge that focus focus that direction they are talking about this morning there we go we got there
Denzel you know to listen to all the old teachings and son and you know passage from from the from the pawn shop in this is a dialogue between the sage shaunika and en Guerra the Sages
 on that so this is like Guru speaking to Disciple This is the training that a yogi gets so it said on that which is self-luminous subtler than the subtle all the worlds and their inhabitants are supported Ride Like That is the imperishable god that manifest is Life Speech in mind that is truth that is Immortal that should be meditated on no disciple meditate on it it's a tit on God is saying right that's behind everything that's supporting everything then this
 taking as a bow the Great
have you punished shots place on it and arrow sharpened by constant meditation join back the Bulge
 thought we thought directed toward that Target a disciple hit that Mark the imperishable own as the bow the self is the arrow God is said to be the target used to be known by those who are on faltering then one becomes United as the arrow with the target it's so different how the modern yoga culture is it was a big relief to me cuz I let you know I immersed myself in spiritual books and spiritual teachings but I never heard of like a goal a goal right where to go like there's things to do everyday that will help me get towards that goal right there's ways to behave that's the realest thing
 be
it's so pretentious but but what you said was so important where you started which was like someone might think quick I'm very doing yoga once I was telling someone and in a class and you know
 I'm flexible so I like to do like the teacher says something I'll do a little something extra not because I'm trying to show up just because it's like they don't move that part of my body it's just a feel stiff so we're I'm doing a bunch of stuff and and and and I'm grabbing my toe and I'm lifting up my other leg and the teacher comes over like the Buddha and goes to less regular dewlaps less it's like the everything is sort of Twisted and backward
because they don't understand moving towards the ego moving towards like I'm a controller I'm the owner on the master yeah don't do that
 but if something can facilitate your freedom your connection your spirit really stay up late do it unless you're quiet today but I wish I was saying they're going to where you started as it's so important because if we're going to have that Focus people may feel it's how can I have that Focus I have kids to raise have a job to do that has nothing to do apparently with my spiritual life I have all these other concerns and they pile up how can I possibly stay with this razor sharp Focus
and it seems like the yogis of of the past would go off to the forest so that they could have that Focus so there wouldn't be any distractions but where you started saying no no no there's a wet and this is why bug of agita becomes really the most important influence
 wall of the text is because that's where it showed that a working person a person of this world does not need to go away to visit matter fact that's where I was going to start some Christians like that that's not going to work hard you know you need to find a way to take your occupation and your worldly duties and and focus them on the ultimate goal right so so so the Euro he has this cold about to Yogi has his goal my goal right my very clearly articulated goal is that in this life I want to be moving towards and ultimately achieve Pyaar Prema in the pure love of God without any kind of
 without any selfish motivation
play Pure Love true love for God. I'll probably be that's my goal I'm focused on that my everything is dedicated to my family life it also becomes part of that my occupation even if it's not direct is a way we can find that to make that a part of it my all of my duties all of my responsibilities they all become part of that and that's where good guy and it's going to help us Rican sieve of exactly what we're doing and bring it all tied all into that one goal for us because I'd say pretty much all of us are household household and he reminds me of Lindsay Scott who is one of grades dedicated Zoomers others has been with us this year for the show even started practically she has to
 now I'm children 11 and 12 as pure devotional service look for me like mother and his two little kids who need tons of
attention at all times tons of care takes so much of their time and I'm answering it was like your devotional service is going to look much different than you burn for you then if you were to be
 single individual walking barefoot through India to look much different maybe that's the classic archetype of pure devotional service this is different in I like this analogy a lot of like a mother cow is eating the grass but the face at the third eye is always watching the cow there always are calf rather the cows eating the grass but it's always got a guy has most important what's my concern is that cap safe and that's what we do we just wherever we are eating the grass ultimately for the cat but your vacation but all this
oh here they had some vacation they took something you know everyone has their Memorial Day Weekend they're looking for it or I'm going to go here I'm going to go there every one that said I'm going to make my my vacation time connected to that one called you know what family vacations are nice and like this year I'm taking all my kids to Italy for a little retreat
 Haitian a lot of sense I was like yeah we're going to have that cool okay is that cool that it's worth like what we become in our Outreach to the world into our family or to our spouse that thinks I'm a little crazy whatever like that we we we we we learn appropriate doses of medicine to kill to kill a anybody knowing we did it
yeah because if we don't internet and if we don't give the medicine we don't get over our material malady
 if we give them too much it's an overdose so you got to know how much to give everyone it sometimes you see in person or you might have even met somebody the other person just like why do guys shave your head you're into are you fully are you a fool
 but
 if I don't give anything to the person they never grow I've always been copied after the teacher myself I've been caught between that I didn't remember there was that one time I was just teaching yoga Lots I chat with people get a little Bhagavad Gita slokas in the class I get some spiritual Insight but if people ask me further what what should I do if I wouldn't give I just feel like Outback
a little bit and then it was Treecko Benda and we were at a retreat and SRI Govinda came to the retreat back then he was eating and he wasn't like like fall on the principles or chant he was chanted one around today and then he met his wife now to make sure he's a very fired up and fixed up some sun dreams are very fired up fixed up serious yogini Buck to yogini and they sat down together he's like do you chant you and she's like you've been into this for how long you just chat one and I was like a minute I was over here in the conversation and I was like all she's being too pushy but it completely changed him he completely changed him he started like really cleaning up his whole life and ended started chanting seriously and I was like man I got to push why I got to get more medicine sometimes I can't be so backing off
 but at the same time I don't want what you got
it's up it's our duty to find the balance when we're extending our hands of people how much they need and how much it is it's delicate because we care we want people to grow as we grow and that's part of our growth is to is to become an expert physician beautiful are you ready to the shipment once you drop respect labason cease to the Supreme Lord and Ryan Hunter and reseat the super most human being and some other sharks walk to the goddess of learning at the Sheeley house today of the author not a show about race Unity among God's service Lapeer devotees
all that is troublesome to the Haro become eradicated and loving service to the Supreme Lord he was praised with transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact yeah yeah
 my teachers open my eyes that have knowledge base and sees a Lotus feet for the Shu mod bag of a time can 27 chapter 9 test 46
 where in it
 oh Supreme personality of godhead who speaking this is fraud young prologue 5 years old cuz he's pretty sure Gabe is the Avatar of Vishnu is half man and half lion
the great. I'm free prayers and he's pacifying is very ferocious incarnation of the Lord usually when we hear these stories of more loving side but the street but you do look like a lion but we're just getting to the point these prayers are there that he's cooling down he's cooling down and it's about to get real soft
 but this is what this is I think you can find this fascinating verse speak less
 but but this is the acid is way the composer of all the Vedic literature of high
lighting something highlighting a message something we were talking about it in our in our studies over the past couple days that there's a there's a somewhat of a hidden message somewhat of a secret message through all of his works but not everybody was able to pick up on it so when he got to the bar with Tom which is like his kind of conclusion of it all starts to really push things forward and there's a message in this verse and that he wants to finish Masterpiece just sometimes you see people building a building and starts off they just do the framing and then the cement then they put up the frame he's like okay all right and then as we actually start building it out and things big like wow that's it that's what the Baldwin Thomas is everything fully built out and it's beautiful
 okay and it's all right but there's more to it
 do that's right I just know because of this
then this is the reason why because it explains everything in the past write it it's it's it's not just like a it build up to a conclusion that's there for sure but it's also explains everything that had been spoken of before that's why I said split it actually basement Tenma scribed methods on the path of liberation of Silence it's fun
 not to speak to anyone who deserve our house to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge to undergo austerities to study The Vedas and other Vedic literature's to execute the duties of an ashram Dharma to explain the shastra has to stay in a solitary place
 interesting yeah they solitary
alignment having prison could be if you're in the right frame of mind to be like
 to chant mantras silently and to absorb them to be absorbed in trance okay these are all very if you read through the upon a child's if you read through the Saints and text if you hear from different Masters they're going to glorify these practices since say that these are the way to understand truth these are the way to achieve freedom to cheap liberation
 Lots got a little bit of a different slant on it use different methods for Liberation or generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses meeting to try to impress their we see that with data cards
your time in India are like professionals their professional career to speak about it for real you do a cursive Hozier Hozier like real the hardcore scene we look pretty normal the hardcore scene there's one more guy comes with a fan Mohawk and a classic leather jacket and a Plaid Pantry Bowser doesn't really know the music but we just showing up but he's like
 you never liked poser there's no pretense here oh yeah when you really feel that not pretentiousness and you
it it it moves you in another way so he's pointing out the apocracy he's saying that you know these all these qualities being silent and living alone and amassing Vedic knowledge and undergoing austerities I think to the West remember like I wouldn't want to do this do not want to do that but in Indy of these things are really respected sure it's like wow this person people you see someone live that life and you think they deserve respect they deserve some honor they deserve some donation they deserve so you know it's something they just start to get these rewards for it if one side carefully start doing these things which are supposed to detach one from at your things you start doing them for the material rewards the desire for honor is huge huge pothole subtle but it's such a huge hurdle to get over my desire for other humans to validate me
 now he's going to pick who this is real
these different methods for Liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses because such persons are falsely proud these procedures may not be successful okay so this question of Pride becomes really important this none of all of these practices that were mentioned nothing wrong with him cuz that's not saying they're bad but he's going to show that there's a central Focus right there's something that's most but all of these are done when they're done well when they're done
 they're done well when they're done or the Central purpose if I'm doing them and I'm not focus on that Central purpose then really I'm just wasting my time I look like a deeply spiritual person because of his external practices but I haven't really understood and heat he's too to help us understand what's the difference what's the dissension he's met
Stride Rite certain Pride we were talking about this a lot over the weekend that you know Krishna he's speaking the whole bag of weed eater and end in what sense you all do punished as in the end that they come from him as well but in the bug because he says are June and I want to share with you the most confidential part of all of the basic teachings and in that has to do with understanding that there's a person behind everything that there's something and I am that person and at the at the end of that chapter the 9th chapter he says you know where me you know I always think of me now down before me connect with me and if I'm falsely proud and I hear that message I cannot remember
 and therefore I can understand the confidential information in these texted that I never even I may read it even I may hear it I don't understand it because Arjuna was
like that because Arjuna had nothing but love for Krishna Krishna says guard unit you can hear because you have no envy and you know you would have say is probably the same thing as Pride write the i d like I don't need you that's my pride and Ambrosia coming down Friday clogs the drain it just will not flow through yes and then and then bro Jones I realize you're coming down a drain okay
 Dragon trainer you need the Holy Name which is the Drano
 scrap the whole way through the grime and grease
 cuz she was born have it
I authorize bait acknowledge one can see which one can see that the forms of cause and effect in the concert of a station belong to the Supreme verse about it God had for the cosmic Cosmic manifestation is his energy okay both cause and effect are nothing but energy is of the Lord therefore on my Lord just as a wise man by considering cause and effect can see how buyer pervades would those engaged in devotional service understand how you are both the cause and effect and okay so it's saying how do we get how do we understand that Central Focus we had an inquisitive person start to ask questions about life where does everything come from ride like how did how did all this get that there's a cause behind all of this I need to follow it back by the way back.
the back try to see what the origin of all of this is and if I can understand that then I might be able to send what is the Central purpose of life and you can watch with the commenter to the 1st or something yeah
 turn it up
 two less Mara you less thank you
 has described the previous versus many so-called students of spiritual understanding all of the 10 different methods known as Mona brought the fruit the Top O Jana SWAT Dharma Moksha rajapaksa Madea all those things that had been mentioned these Island taking vows Kim Lee and Alex are these baby very attractive but by following such methods like no one in this world we understand the real cause and effect and the origin original cause of everything
original source of everything is the Supreme personality of Gotham's himself this is says the star of a carton a carton of the cause of all causes the Starbuck karunakaran this original source of everything is Krishna the supreme ruler each vada-pav democracy such as he has the eternal spirit indeed is the root of everything being a mum sarva bhuteshu not right is the Original Seed whatever manifestation exist their cause is the Supreme person out at this cannot be understood by so-called silence
 or by any other hodgepodge method permaculture teacher eaten something interesting here I had a matter to you that tasting teacher when I was in high school I like this and then I got my breath
guy over here put them all together and going to hodge-podge my own spiritual life here together and you go to the place that has a
 go to Vegas casino like a salad bar and Buffets in Vegas Nevada under in Reno for a. And it was like prostitution and it wasn't gambling you took away salad bars in Chinese food like almost like
 every international cuisine
salad and peaches and syrup and cottage whatever you and even if you did like those things individually and they had some effect when mixed all together everyone felt like hell yeah it was like the Chinese fought the Italians that's what was going on I'm coming
 and yet you loved me what is it the Auto Mart so much what is it the auto-tune is travel to Italy known as the side rest stops are Primo finally found someone that I've been there you haven't been to the good ones are spiritual practice and he end up with in the jaw
you don't get the desired results
 it was one of those PBS shows like after Sesame Street or something like that. I think they did all kind of arts and crafts and stuff on it to take away from that
 original source of everything hodgepodge this cannot be understood by so-called silence or any other hodgepodge Methodist a great word the Supreme cause can be understood only by the Postal Service as stated in the bug of agita
 elsewhere in the srimad bhagavatam the Supreme God had personally says Buck you hum.
one can understand the original cause of all causes the Supreme person only by devotional service not by show bottle exhibitionism are you understand God I just mailed yesterday I like it at in the material world he's got another and the macro we understand the micro in the micro we can examine people we can notice them we can see their habits but you can never know them because I only know a person through love and when you love a person and they feel safe with you they reveal their heart to you they share their anxiety their fears their hopes their dreams and that's part of love that we hopefully we all have at least one person our life that we love and that loves us we feel safe around and we can share some intimate feelings
Christmas the same way we learn to love Krishna and and then Christmas has to reveal himself to us and with the revealing of himself to us he gives us cause less knowledge of how to escape the Maze of the material world and Detachment from the things that I'm gripping on to that are hurting me
 so the analogy was just as love reveals
 a person's identity in a relationship sure and not just the external idea let not just a Persona or the Bravada that people present they show their vulnerable side Krishna shows in micro in our relationship with God Krishna actually reveals himself to us and makes himself under we start to understand who he is and he starts to understand who we are and we reveal our self because Krishna wants us in a raw genuine authentic self sometimes we'll go through some person
hell and we find my I'm going through hell right now or my ego is shedding right now and it's actually a great and Chris is getting to know me underneath I've been full of pretense I've been full of a show about show bottle this show bottle prideful
 it's part of our evolving in our spiritual life is our fake self cracking a way to understand that excellent in the hold with an excellent approved analogy okay let's keep going we got to go what is way to go back and got to go back up back to the verse
 text 48-0 Supreme Lord you are actually the are the Earth of fire the sky and the water you are the objects of sense perception the life airs write the five senses the mind that Consciousness and the false ego indeed
everything subtle and gross the material elements and anything else and anything Express either by word or by the mind are nothing but you okay so he was talking about finding the cause you know that there's for every effect there's got to be a cause behind it he's saying I see that you are the cause everything that we experienced you're the cause behind it is is is starting to bring us into focusrite someone may do all of these incredible spiritual practices Moana brought the remaining silent in a powerful try that today these are like these are like impressive
 feets in one sense but if they're not focused on that one as Marcus Aurelius was saying right
everything into that one Focus otherwise you're working very hard in this world you're not getting anywhere a lot saying that let's figure out what the focus is this what's the target what and that behind every cause there's this person all to me there's a swordfish noise so the causes and relate the the all that we're doing becomes in relation to that one central figure now we're going to get to the root of yoga that were going to get to the root of all existence if we don't do these practices but he says but it for prideful as you're sending then that what's who's behind it is never revealed
 of reality never opens up until the pride the full picture of it is never opens up until we release the pride until we release the envy and then you can see everything
 text 4829
neither the three modes of material nature just Thomas nor the predominating DD's controlling the three modes nor the five gross elements nor the mine nor the gods nor the human beings can understand your lordship
 are there all subject to birth and Annihilation considering this the spiritually Advanced have taken to bhakti devotional Service Such wise people hardly bother with me to study instead they engage themselves in practice impractical devotional service is going on at your Town's going on and they're like you know what I'm just going to scrub the kitchen ice I went in the kitchen last night cuz it's somebody came late and I wanted to make sure there's all everybody's like running around Miguel Gutierrez sweeping cleaning polish and stuff
it's like what's this isn't normal activity I want to stay up late I'm totally exhausted with a stiff way to clean things
 that makes no material sense people always trying to sneak away I need an app to take a break is there any leftover or dessert that's what people think generally stay up late answer
 that's powerful when you start to find joint service you're starting to understand the message behind you. There's a lot of a lot of people have been made everything very sweet right you know what I've done lots of yoga retreats in my life as a yoga teacher but these wisdom of the sages Retreats are so special because any don't retreat store to get a wide what's the word swagath
 I'm all different people where they're at in their life spiritually materially excetera but it's almost
wismec ages Community have been growing sort of together and it's sort of get it they get it like it's not about me that it's all about evolving through love to service the carry you serving each other and it makes in this like little micro experiment it's so peaceful and so like it's just like it's easier it's not like you're snoring shut up in hours like I mean there's a lot of reasons to be complaining when you're on a yoga retreat you know what a lot you might have a lot of friends or be like I would never sleep in a bunk you know on I am not paying money to sleep in a bunk on a Saturday and I've been waking up at 5 forget it but it takes a type of like tolerance which we cherish little compassion which would cherish not criticizing not finding it or not finding fault with people it's easy to find fault when you're cramping together and
annoying you until you're off and I want to talk to him and it's just like a sweet environments of bhakti yoga and you could just automatically see how you add box of your life you can have peace in your life you got peace in your family you put it into town you got peace in your town you put in your nation the peace in your nation you put in the world that piece in the world
 I'm going to just give us the the plan for World Peace you're welcome. This is very significant so he sang and in this is going exactly to what you're saying is he goes ahead and he says even Lord Shiva and Lord ra ma cuz he said the corner of the tars
 so he's saying that
 all our accomplishments as Yogi's no matter how I stereo no matter how
I heard we are it doesn't reveal the full truth you don't understand who is behind all of this and he said and then he says it's so therefore such wise men hardly bother with Vedic study that's like a very significant statement that you could take all of these Yogi's and sages is bearded you know readers of these taxis great teachers and Masters and he's saying the ones that really and they're all saying the path is knowledge is Gana is the way you need to read these books. Even contemplate them and you will become free and understand everything is the opposite of everything that were thinking isn't it well it's it's
 it's definitely a big shift in terms of like that with the message of how people interpret The Vedic literature that he sent so so prahlada is standing before Lord Vishnu he's been promoted in front of all the different Davis and Universal ruler
as the one that's closest to God and he's been pushed forward you're the one that should speak and then he starts saying things that seem to contradict they don't actually contradict but they just bring everything into clearer Focus but they seem to contradict a lot of the yogic teachings and you know Vedic ideas send why is people they aren't they hardly mess with Vedic study at all right instead they serve you your they serve you without any Pride they serve you without any ego they serve you without any envy and that opens up everything as you were saying when you actually show love it in other words it's almost like saying you want understand the universe you have to show love to the universe if you if you'd leave us aside all selfishness all self-centered concern which love requires
 and in serving that moved in everything becomes revealed and so therefore he's he's raising bhakti for Lodge raising bhakti to a higher status than Gianna in love
she do another yeah
 therefore
 therefore the super supreme personality of godhead the best of all persons to whom prayers are offered I offer my respectful of basin season to you without rendering six kinds of devotional service on to you until you offering prayers dedicating all the results of activities worshipping you working on your behalf always remembering your Lotus feet and hearing about your glories who can achieve that which is meant for the r on the hamsa so I'm poor. Got to go back to Marcus Aurelius right he said he says something it is quite dumb
 it almost sounds impractical or undoable but by people who lived all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse towards the prahlada speaking about how every thought every impulse to be directed in that towards that one
purpose right how can all be dovetailed into it
 X51 the last one the great Saints add dust Lauren the string at a was pacified by the devotee provide my garage with prayers offered from the transit Dental platform the lord gave up his anger and being very kind to provide who is offering prostrated obeisance he's he spoke as follows we're about to hear from The Stranger Dave tomorrow
