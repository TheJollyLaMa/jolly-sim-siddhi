in the ganga you do three drops or full submersion that's what I want to know the truth
 that's what it be next to today's almost over tomorrow tomorrow I leave leave all right how you getting there
 yeah I'm going to get these hard to leave here right now I was just having lunch with indigenous women is like oh you're leaving that's so sad I said it's it is sad but I am going to go over. He said well I suppose that makes it up what is the what is the program there for the kirtan thing how long does that go for it goes till the 21st so start on the 1st and goes to the 21st 21 days
but she's amazing and every night it's like killing it the devel every night you know the violin violin player over here I'll let you know what's your name or anyone else she is she's like a world famous violin player
 we should interview you're right she's so high level and that she's the lead violinist
 in Miller Monica Moscow Vienna which is like you know like a bigger than Moscow a cradle love of classical music you know sake Mozart and everyone is so she's not the not the units like the fur
The Soloist you know like the number was the first chair it's called but she's no it's not the first chairs be on a chair that's like The Soloist so let you know the first chair sit down the solar system and up and I never sits and she plays the 17 million dollar Stratovarius I think so I think that's what I heard
 revile interest and you know like you know the kirtan leader like you do at a certain point just trying to hurry you know you're not over in her Direction then she just starts to play and it's like she's chanting through that thing you know and it's like the world's number one first and brag but I was just such a super high level
you want to say something with her parents are devotees and and his family and her parents are also great musicians and when she was a little girl but Harper was just tell me what she was like a little girl she wanted to become a professional violinist
 in other devotees were discouraging or because they're like you know I was such a Cutthroat you know I got to make a living doing music deep deep kind of my kind of world who know it's it is a country that everyone's fighting for that position
 Christian dumb and in he said he encouraged her you know and now here she is years later and she's like you know she's at soloist she's like super your name is Alexandra to hurt her
 her Instagram account is at alexandria.gov tirs you and her
all of these musicians right now are really really good it was that are there and she's kind of like just on this whole other level of musicianship to and I just makes me want to just sit down and shut up and play the violin so you can appreciate your right yeah I play the violin like a chimpanzee Banks two sticks together I was at you do in the summer when I was in Australia no guys at that event to know where they're all these stories and remember we were on that floating thing will you float off into the yeah that way that's what they call it a deal or something
 it's called a flotilla or something like that it's like just a deck floating thing that was on the water with a ninja
an anchor so it's so anyway what were on that up sitting right next to her she was playing and was like wow like that the quality that violin in the club my God like we're talking about
 where I've been thinking I think it's talked about this yesterday I can I'm thinking a lot about it right now. That's Dave & Buster the Box you sit on the source want to talk or how Krishna descends and enters Into the Heart right and then when you enchant really the chanting the name is not just a Monday and sound vibration make with your mouth but it had then it has to rise from your heart through your mouth and that's the holy name and you know it's like
 how does that how does Krishna descend into our hearts you know it's by your Muhammad Ahmad music by associated with great devotees it's by going to the holy. You know it has to accumulate these feelings that you have in your heart that become expressed through the name when you chanted
and you know when she's playing it feel like this is how Christian is accumulated in her heart is coming through the violent
 there is something there's something about people are expert at an art but also filled with body but the motivation may be different and it may be totally not bhakti it could be like the flow they have some Divine Shakti running through them that got some empowerment from a previous life some Mystic Perfection but it's not necessarily Bacchus when you see a devotee with this type of emerging of the Shakti in the body and is quite impressive merging two shots in the Box blessed me with that brother right now thank you
 Tamara does announcement on the show

What do you think what are you doing is trying to be serious here and you bring me to 78 Live skits come on can I do my announcements now
let's get gone let's get into the Nugget
 then I am the musketeer that I'm Jay
 what's the Nugget I didn't get another today though there's another Tuesdays with Morrie nugget yep
 I thought this was yesterday's okay continuing on with Morrie I like the picture this you know elderly Jewish Professor guy like about to pass away who just I got these insights yeah
 these people were so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes only likeness they were real things and expecting a sort of hug back but it never works but appropriate that I have things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of camaraderie
comrade comrade ship I'm red ship that's from Tuesday's of Morrie I said in Youth of today before I was able to vote I said are we in love or just so alone that we're looking for anyone to hold of the idea is that the soul is desperately lonely yes and then we find anybody that's interested in us you're interested in me
 we have such low of bar of who we let into our life because the saw is deeply lonely and it's not just for like like the person who just stays alone in it in their house and doesn't go out much no actually I'm quite satisfied in the soul is hungry
for reciprocal love and so this Mystic such a great quote huh these people were so hungry for love that they were accepted accepting substitutes they were embracing material things expecting a sort of bug back that was poetry there you go there you see you or you are so excited about this nugget before we started well as it got thrown upon me at the last minute you like the Maury again that guy with my phone off so when you send me a text I'm not even look at it I'm in route and Krishna
 you know you know what this reminds me of when you were practically speaking from the right now recognize yeah you're thinking like Mother Teresa because I think in the journey home when he speaks about Mother Teresa over here right now I am here
how to grease you can't send I mean you can't send images over that chap or discuss the journey home when ramaswamy speaks about Mother Teresa I believe the quote that he really remembered and share their what she was saying that you know cuz she was feeding so many hungry people in
 Nina and in her car and she said everyone is starving for some food that they're starving for right but everybody's ultimate starving for love
 and I think that Amore here is taking it to the next level since it's right that that's what they're hungry for but it can be hard to find it very hard to find and then brace back in return is not from these from the substitute for these material things that provide who were reading about now he's getting this until yesterday he said you're chilling the two to overhear your you expecting set you know what you're saying expecting a hug back in the metaphor he
using cyco expecting there to be juice in flavor right there is Flavor in a new purchase in the 2024 model in the iPhone 19th there is a there is a flavor there it just gets still quick
 I just gets Del real quick and you know that if you have the newest car you have the newest iPhone and then you don't even think about it and if there's a newer one and that's the way the material world works there's someone newer there's someone fresher if someone like that there's the new 2025 model and if only I could catch up and we spent her whole life playing catch-up to material things that don't necessarily fill us in the first place so then what's going to put feel like that's what we have to the wiser person 26 that's what's going to do it slow down I know but this is a question that the wiser person is like them other two
Lisa is like the more you over here that they're they're kind of recognizing this the kind of seeing that yeah it's certainly the soul does not become fulfilled do anything external okay then what is it you do now now Maurice pricing love like genuine loving and that's there but isn't it also true that that the relationships that we call you no loving in this world also
 let us down and in in at least they're let down the drain of the broader thinker than the wider perspective says at the end of life at least that's broken so it how is it but how is it that the soul finds is complete satisfaction that was one of the questions that initiated the conversation in the bottom of time where the sages are not me trying to gather around and said you know what is it that gives a super City completing a dispatch from the soul and the answer was love you know the answer to that question came in the in the second chapter
I Survived books are in the the highest Dharma for all Humanity you told pop tear ducts Jets its Divine love it's bhakti and when it ain't
 at the origin of all existence and when it's when when is felt and offered
 without any selfish motive
 and then it can deliver complete satisfaction to the self
 material things can always always want more out of we come into this world with material expectations too and it just can't deliver end up sitting first time they flew a plane right they must be like I can't believe it we're flying in the air and then all the sudden few years went by like you know what is cold out here let's get a box on top of this plane. It's pretty nice in here, not on the history of Aviation
wait a second I can only put myself in here in this plane we could sell this experience and then they're like you know what this a long flight to like Paris let's get a movie and then I went to multiple movies right now internet I can't and you have this expectation more and more and more what this plane has no internet and it's like it's never enough with 30,000 feet in the air are serving us lunch we have multiple channels I can chat with a friend and it's not enough
 learning to be satisfied with the basics that's part of what it means to be the yogi right Simplicity kindness these two good and they won't run after that until you drop
yeah what the speaker like that horrible Walk of Shame pass first class it's like to feel horrible walk of shame
 walk across a second-class citizen to computers buying and selling stocks and I'm just like walking to the Gallows they are so horrible having close that curtain there like you to look in here
 if you like a second-class citizen talk about a caste system
 I shall we get into it now yeah
 it's all right
Conquest what should I bring speculation cease to the Supreme Lord Narayan on 29 Ryan Reese you to shoot most human being and some other saraswathi the goddess of learning and SRI Livia kodaly author not stop are you a show about race Unity Chan Baka baka
 irregular tense of class of the box, and Veterinary Services if your devotees all that is troublesome the heart become erratic hated and loving service to the Supreme Lord is praise a trans gentle songs
 will be established as a revocable fact you're into my teachers opening my eyes or the door side of knowledge I offer out Basin Sees at their Lotus feet reading from the street by Bob and Tom can 27 chapter 5 text 31 last announcement cuz scuba Wiz with a safe Retreat we already got a lot of traction from it
attraction from it was most his Retreat is happening on Memorial Day weekend is not even up on our site yet but if you're interested just so just save the save-the-date save the date and email Miss Mara was in the stage with 10 saves one way to gmail.com Boombah to hold a spot okay and I'm excited to hang out with everybody this spring
 going to come faster than we think Runner oh I know it's already proving time my friend it's time to prune the trees what about the little late. Actually the maple syrup
 we missed that boat my friend right now right now not really but it's already too warm it was like 60 degrees last week
 okay okay then let's get into Prodigy no heat so so he was asked what's your favorite thing to learn in school he gave the nine
what is devotion Services father totally freaked out
 but where did you learn this if you didn't learn it from your teachers teachers the same weed and teaching this stuff where'd you learn this and then he starts talking about she want to chew food ways got a couple more verses about this materialistic. Yeah this is a good one the following in the dishwater 3030 because of their uncontrolled census tract persons to addicted to material materialistic life check emissions check that might sound a little like Christian otherworldly know in this lifetime people you get addicted to a realistic life your life becomes hellish life you don't have to go to a fiery planet of Brimstone drowning in a lake of fire this life becomes hellish
get it too materialistic life how hellish conditions I've been in health conditions you know the word uses used is Tommy Shrum
 if I'm not mistaken I must be having to do with Thomas
 how old is Darkness here
 you should learn Sanskrit for the benefit of the you know the welfare of the people we just need a Sanskrit face to show up we are pleased to say we had an Indian or Indian
 you know it was like a journalist responded correspond correspond at the darkness
 oh and then you have proper Translation your hellish life Darkness bring me away from darkness and towards the light
so you could you could translate this profile throws in that that word hellish and of course he was raised in a he learned English and it in and so on
 Antioch Christian College schedule Peoria Christian School was when he was growing up in Calcutta it could have been translated probably seems because it said to make progress towards Darkness right they move towards the darkness could have been translated that way sure we've all been there Dark Places and our material existence again materialistic life made progress towards a hellish or dark condition and repeatedly shoe that which is already been chewed that's like they're sitting in the dark chewing on stale gum just talked to about taking acid it's always like taking acid I took 1,000 hits of acid once no rug
no one has ever taken 1000 hits of acid that would just be too much
 you said that once.
 No they would lose their now look great too and I choose not enough you got to go to 3 and that's the way the material world good your desk for the flavor
 no talk to his dad heads I do it all the time no one does 1,000 I've done it before you have any case unimportant up the answer your phone for your point is your point is valid on the Never Enough the flavor where is out you got to up at you got to just like if I was to drink a glass of wine every drunk why because I don't drink alcohol and therefore you develop people that buy people drinks
a quote tolerance of it and up the ante all sense gratification is like that people want to overdose
 yeah cuz it loses its flavor doesn't become sweeter you know what I was reading I was reading cuz I've been studying little this book by Gina goswami this toughest Ann Arbor
 and he was describing how the Baba Thomas come down or not
 it is history in the universe
 tell me hard okay it was first spoken in those four verses of the chapters low-key right it was kind of giving a seed version from Lord Vishnu to to look for mama a mama spoken in 125 versus to Narda
 the Narda encouraged
cost to go into deep meditation
 and in his meditation the Baba time that we here now what's so funny I can just imagine you heard the time yeah I did a double it to his son Sugardale goswami
 who spoke it to March break it but it was overheard by sudha goswami whose rendition overheating hearing now but the idea that this was what I was going to say was that when shooting a bow Swami walked into the area where Mark fricker was was gathered with all these a list ages
 everyone immediately recognized even though he's 16 years old even though he's naked even though it looks like he's crazy actually
he's the most otherworldly deeply realized the transcendentalist everyone is so hot and when I only saw it everybody felt it everybody knew it
 so they gave him the seat of of you know prominence and then he was the one that spoke bag with Tom to an answer the questions in March. While everyone sat around listen now in that assembly was Joss and Narda okay his Guru his father and his group for both spoken Baba Tom previously like sugar David heard it to them but once you get it within this is the difference between chewing the to dry it's kind of like it wasn't like Northern it look like Norton we also like how we already know the Bobby comes to me. You don't need to hear this again.
 It was like they're hearing it fresh for the first time yeah
they're the ones that spoken to him which speaks both to the nature of the speaker and just how special he was as well as to the nature of the the content itself that is not Material contacted spiritual content which means it doesn't get chewed out it gets sweeter as you to it without that's funny what is it what is a poo that gets a steer as you there is a hunt I mean except in the spiritual World maybe maybe a sugarcane
 no it's actually a tree with a husky to in the house has no taste got to keep chewing and chewing and chewing World sugarcane after they squeeze the thing out is like there's nothing that that multi-step you maybe can make some rope out of it or something like that but nobody wants to chew after that your can rope because bring some
finish the verse
 their inclinations towards Krishna are never aroused that's the other problem with chewing what's other problem with being too addicted to materialistic life your inclinations towards Christner an aroused I've been there to get disgusted with material existence like this is this your lip curonian spit at the thought yeah but that's different you going to charge you
 cuz she was calling you an HRA and he saying it would sense gratification when he see something that's attractive and since traffic has electric oil he said when I think back and went to my past in the way of that I was so attached this is my lip curls and it's been at the thought it's worth it. Because it's taking them out of the high place but I'm saying what we do is we indulge in such gratification they were just like a what the hell am I just done no but he had indulged that's why he felt that way
as a king yes you don't know the story about Ramona Charlie Charlie in his youth he was a great to vote him but then he know he became the king and when you're the king you can all the opulence the money you have many beautiful wives you have unlimited well if you got Fame everybody is doing everything that you say it's not concubines in case he ha he he on
 can we lost touch with it all he forgot it all but there was once a du-rag enough
 and wanted to help him and but he couldn't get to him you know I think he knew him from way in the past something like that we actually just talked to you know I got interviewed for the my porch TV podcast out now like you got interview for the interview me after that yeah and I the story came out and Dunkin Donuts was was okay
tails and I did remember right now but he said he wanted to be 25 years old and was given half the kingdom the king bet his wife that he could not win
 not the money okay so it's so so he couldn't get even though he knew him from the past you couldn't get to him there's too many barriers so what he did was
 he found the cook for the king for humanitarian this saddle and he brought this very special spinach it was a very delicious and very nutritious both made some special cards rare is hard to find that suspicious vicious delicious nutritious slightly suspicious and so he gave it to the Cook and the cook cooked it and brought it to The King The King was like oh this is excellent and then he would bring it every day and he would feed it to the king everyday
 and the king became accustomed
and then one day stopped
 he said Hey where's the spinach today
 oh I you know I'm sorry you know it's always brought by this side of you is really saintly person he comes here he wants to offer to you everyday he comes here and he gives it to me and he didn't come today so I don't have any
 it's a really bring you that the next time that settle comes around bring him to me that is so it is playing work
 and when that's out of God with and then he began to speak with him and open up and he was just so expert that he he brought you much are you reminded him of his devotional life in his devotional service and he brought him back but that brought him back over so when he says when I think back
 my my little curls and I think I spent in he was thinking of his own past when he lost it
 okay
 it was a very very useful beautiful well-groomed squirrel
100 Strokes by their own efforts or a combination of both
 sad text 31 persons who are strongly and trapped by the consciousness of enjoying material life statement persons were strongly and trapped by the consciousness of enjoy material life and you have therefore accepted as their leader or Guru a similar blind man attached to external sense objects cannot understand that the goal of life is to return home back to godhead and engage in service of Lord Vishnu as a blind man Guided by another blind man missed the right path and fall into a ditch
 materially attached men led by another
materially attachment are bound by the ropes of fruit of Labor which are made very strong which are made of very strong cords and they continued again and again and materialistic life suffering the threefold miseries
 little for that couch preach preach so so so when he says
 he says persons are strongly trapped by the consciousness of enjoin with your life and who have therefore accept you as their leader of Guru similar blind man attached external sense objects cannot understand the goal of life that's the world that we live in you know that that's the goal of life is not very clear
if we stopped people and she wants to go to the life you know
 people are going to have a very clear idea about it they haven't heard in Hindus go to be someone is going to come along and tell him but I could show you how to make more money
 just follow me you're doing it wrong and then you phone to the ditch okay
 Murray 32 this is the third verse from her loud
 unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of advice now that sounds crazy unless you're interested unless you're in the club and says really crazy right unless they smear poop on their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of ice like the British translating this but like what the hell you freed from a tier 3 that whole step it's probably help unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of a load of speed of a bike shop completely freed from a trail contamination person's very much inclined towards materialistic life cannot be attached to
Lotus feet of the Lord who is glorified for his uncommon activities only by becoming Krishna conscious and taking shelter at the Lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from the material contamination you know they say there's three things that can accelerate your spiritual life and want it and all three of them if you're actually to study them
 sound disgusting what are the three standards they are considered unclean and dirty to have someone put touch you that's why we don't extend our legs and point your feet at someone that's how much foot touches you was considered dirty to get the water of their feet you watch someone's what you just took a bath and we go in there licking up the water for the back that's why she was like right or you know in the third one is you know once someone put even in India the poorest people if you're eating food like I'm a failure like I'm eating a burrito there's a homeless guy
I want a burrito and they like they appreciate that in India if you're eating food and you see someone who's War you can't offer them your plate of half-eaten food they just don't take it it's just considered dirty so these three things one done by a great vyshnavi they should never be conceived another considered very very dirty by my regular standards they are considered very very high things the remnants of the food of the vice Navas great Souls very very high to get that it can accelerate our body
 the foot touching the feet of the great Souls
 3 with a guru comes you wash the feet of her feet are his feet in the water used to wash a ticket drop that water is like it's like it Elixir it's like it's like a superfood a transitive that's what they say
can't believe you just told that weird story went there okay I just letting them into the secret this bhakti liar smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of the bike shops that sounds crazy but I'm just trying to shut light them up I will do you believe I understand that actually it is taken literally but do you also believe that there's a figurative way to understand that yes thank you for being so broad-minded but yeah you can take it both ways what would you buy dust of the lotus feet you can take that mean you know you means you're basically you're accepting them as your leader as your captain of your ship as your as you are a GPS as your as your internal Compass if you smear upon their bodies a duster low to speed up this person is my lights my bright light my lighthouse in my life yes you can take it like that too
yeah at the end of something
 Beyond just the direction that I got from this person there's I suppose there's something you don't like taking the dust of one's feet of me and said your senior so very low compared to them right just like there's a sense of humility and like I'm down here by your feet when you walk the dust is getting kicked up that's where I want to be you you know we're right down right down here and we see that in by subkulture huh the greatest Souls the most of learning people they throw like they feel themselves very lowly it before the show is reading that blows it on the Saraswati tacora verse and it was like even though he's so high he's a great learning Cindy awesome very very renowned he is thinking themselves very very lowly and not starting hot chestnuts of spiritual life is there in reality what are we in real
it's not like we are
 how can I write a tiny blade of grass in a massive field right that's all we are and to think like oh yeah you could buy my Mercy but don't they know who I am who do they think they are that's just like we are in the material world and the arrogance repels truth it repels God and repels knowledge and Republic bhakti
 but that humility I'm very tiny it attracts the truth that attract yeah I suppose that's repulsive to one who has an inner misconception say dinner in other words if they identify success and happiness coming through
 being elevated in the eyes of others right that's what I need I need the prestige yeah I need to be recognized
as higher than others yeah when that's fixed deep in your mind then the idea the very idea of being low is is repugnant and there's a strong resistance to it but if you don't have that
 then you might think yourself in one sense very low compared to another
 it's not that you're thinking that you you are worthless or terrible or or anything like that but it's out of your respect for that person that you're approaching that you see them is higher than you you're down at the feet and you're getting the dust down there that's exactly where you want to be right that's exactly where you want to be in a minute it doesn't mean that is not a question you do at the same time you embracing the truth that I am made of the Eternal spiritual energy of the Supreme Lord I am made of the bright shining do you know spiritual energy that's
I am are you laughing at you doing like one band named after another I am I strong resistance with strawberries help what is that a real band are you to send it with me and now that we're strong resistance from Boston this one called that's all but that's mirroring app on their bodies a dust that's saying it's it's what is it saying and it may sound crazy but it's really saying to develop the deepest appreciation with humility
 are the Grapevine that was right you know it sounds crazy me and Mariah just witnessed a man a covert on hill and we tell this another shirt on just like literally behaving himself in dust and we just looked at each other we're like yeah don't take it figured I should have gotten right down there with him literally you don't shut up but you know
I was thinking I was like it was my last shirt I don't want to get it dirty I had some material to take the shirt off and I was like you know what I don't want to get all Sandy I still have to walk like were you thinking about that even when you were walking like I should have done it now I was and I was like you know what I don't want to get all dirty right now but that's yeah that's what I was I had an experience yesterday and today
 yes I walked you know rishikesh has allowed these kind of Ali's you know I do and I was walking up on a lien and I stopped person said he was a young man
 and he was sitting kind of like I'm a little stupid kind of thing and I could see his foot was injured like a fresh wound
and it was wrapped in a very primitive way permadeath and he was suffering and I was walking by him and there are other people in the area right now and I guess there's something in me that just want to get past him
 and capacity like don't look at him anymore just go on with me and asked me for money yeah yeah I kind of purse all that happened
 highlight 19
 yeah and then I got past him any kind of did call out to me didn't do it very strong
 you know just kind of yeah yeah and you're like no time and I kept walking and I felt a pinch in my heart like what the hell am I doing
and at a certain point I turned around I almost walked back and there's some other loser because it was Jesus well I was thinking that instead of Jesus but just like you know what's going to happen to my heart if I just walk past without even know I had the feeling in my heart that I don't want to have when I confront someone that suffering and but today I walked up the same alley the same time he was sleeping on the ground
 and will you do that this time you had a change of heart I had to change cuz I wanted to after I was passing it I just I repented and turned good and so would you do this time I thought you helped them out that's good and I felt I felt I felt good about that because yeah we do have to you know what
 we have to go that extra step I want you to go back to go over to Aunt take your shirt off and would like to
Kittery damn it he didn't seem hungry but he seemed like you had a foot that wasn't going to put his shoe you know you needed help with hydrogen peroxide on it for a while I try to help him out so
 anyway I will go back to go or not because I want to help him in Batu because I can't let my heart become hard I can't you know sure we can't do that okay we got to get that dust let's get
 what is a showing at 7 that means it's time for a run take away Amira how you been you been doing stuff was sitting so still I was looking at was looking at myself in the camera and I'm talking I'm talking and it's frozen
 what about you what about you again.
get down in that dust because it's inappropriate for me to be bathing in the dust with another man. I think it would but it would have been spiritually hi I actually felt like I didn't want to ruin his Bob
