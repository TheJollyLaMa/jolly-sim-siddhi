today by
 live from Super Soul farm this is wisdom of the ages of daily go to podcast with your host Roketa and co-host and Senior educator The Body Center New York is stupid ass who is live and we're not even welcome to show everybody about the Supercell
 or hear back from the auspicious wedding of Cindy and Steven love those guys and a bunch of other devotees who came a lot of super-soul family members and consumers live in from Dobbin and even David Adventures for us cuz you nothing but Green Goblin Adventures are not I mean I could give you the whole
take me to walk around the punch croches I didn't do the punch croches measurements are different in different countries yeah I suppose that's amazing I mean you know meters and yards is one thing but when you get to crush it when I get to the Roches I am different and miss your time difference in years he'll different STDs titi's but honestly has no more do you want to hear about it or should I go into it
 lease lease okay well after the show I went to the temple for the Cure Town it was
beautiful used to be a lot of people there now there's like a lot more people there it was honestly it doesn't matter anymore cuz there's so many people in the whole time it's like the whole thing is I came back at 8:30 and still going yeah it's out of control how hard you're about the explosion like lot of young young Indian people dancing nicely in unison I was impressed with that lots of them in a spiritual Renaissance right now
 you know what part of me is you saying we're never going to be back to be able to recapture the world that we you and I you know grew up in and was beautiful and it's it's a little bit hectic and it'll be crowded and
 is the one thing that disappointed me
this is a billion I stay high but there's just a billion phones out like everybody has got their whatever it's like you're missing the point. Everyone's going to watch it through their phone yeah it's it takes it it takes an empowered person say everybody chant like that's what we're all here for such an advanced together not just to hold this thing up but that being said ultimately it's a beautiful thing to see so many people getting into it so I had a wonderful time and Temple and then I just said I'm I'm going you know I just jumped in a rickshaw and headed down now course the traffic is like an insane and noisy all it's so boring as hell and I know we got to that point I was trying to I want to go to Radha Ramana mandir but by the time we got closed because of what I did was
 we got to we got jammed up right where you
make a right hand turn to tickle mindegy Monday or so after couple minutes to sit there just have to go in to just go to go finish that I wanted to go to Temple what are Masterpiece of architecture you know wandered in there everywhere I go I feel
 you know I broke another thing is cuz we've been reading all the time for 4 years together every day you know when I go to these places I feel I can say the prayers that I want and need to say you can say what needs to be said that's what praying is all that and realize you have to say what needs to be said cuz I sometimes in a relationship you know good man and why do you guys have been with us there too
 yeah. It what is is making my you know Brenda oven is the is the place of the bog of a Time
I like it it's a place that's it is the culture of the bog time it's culture Krishna and when I walk in these play I just feel you know I just like in a relationship sometimes like there's something in between and you have to say what needs to be said you got to go right to it you know and I feel like I feel like that happening so I United wonderful time to Radha Govinda you tell me that I just started wandering you know I used to know my way walking around all the place I'm a little bit Rusty or than it when I was back in those days building stuff he has a lot of the markers are different but I just wandered out of there I took a left
 and I found that a mini my temple or Lord chaitanya huge in the paintings in there just so moving and then I and then I wandered down I just found this Hannah Montana
the bunch of solder is doing kirtan
 I wandered in there an interesting cuz you know there's South Indian temple that we are never allowed in they letting you in now they let you know no kidding he is right there it's right there any white women with the Saudis there beautiful you know all turbaned up in bearded in the whole thing sitting down there and made eye contact and vitamin sit down right next to him and then pointed to the pile and shakers in all different kind of shows like 20 different things to choose from this that and the other is rocking out what they were doing like a sitaram radhe shyam kind of thing A Beautiful Soul
beautiful souls and then I've managed you know that I was trying to find router in mine and you know every now and then or that someone and then this one lady I was asking one lady
 and she's like that way it but another L like you know just follow me
 she took a ride to her house and maybe kitchari behind her and she would look back every now and then just make sure I was there but you know down the dark alleys of you know Brenda liquid has no light at all you know it was a monkey Silhouettes plenty of monkeys and Rod are mine cool I mean that place also packed packed everything packed now but beautiful very beautiful day and they had it all tensed up like we're talkin about yesterday you know so it's like you're in a tent
the courtyard was all covered with like the kind of like a
 you know appointed kind of tinted thing dancing with Butte incredible band dancing like crazy was kind of like I don't know exactly but it kind of seemed like gay night ha ha. It's like you know all these all these men dancing you know what a very feminine ways having feminine feminine is what it is it's like you don't always just man or just on a Bosch they're loving other man they're holding hands with other man is just like. It's just it's just
 it's just beautiful we have too much like masculinity like every time I Want to Hold Your Hand used to pull away.
do you like no let's hold it let's keep it private and I say no public but anyway but anyway yeah it's just it's just a lot of fast and that's all there is to it and that's what he was going on it was a female to stop living in the past you and I have to stop coming on saying it like we saw it that's what I'm saying right now to Nami going on throughout the world throughout the Western world but also throughout Russia and Eastern Europe and that's huge i m Russian Temple practically cuz there's so many Russians in the body and then of course there is India which is having their biggest spiritual Renaissance forever I mean in the sixties when probably came to America Indians the pulse of India was like let's move to the West let's move to the beat
the last of the top Western culture it's not like that they're embracing their culture there's so many good musicians and Puritan people in India better huge out of millions of followers on YouTube and Spotify that are resurrecting these old broads by John's and Puritans and they they're like celebrities
 so anyway after Radha Ramana wander through Lloyd Bazaar on the way home I finally got in a rickshaw and no point in getting one on the other side of light Hazard because it's just so Janda and then when I got back was a third I went into the Crystal Ballroom Monday again in the place was smoking still go and catch a pack so that was a great and I know if I should go through all I did today today was awesome I mean pissed awesome
do quick look like you know what I'm living a curiously through your a little you know morning made it just in time for pro pods Mangal aarti and it stopped at somebody is this what you do a proper passed away and that was the last thing I did last night is I wandered into Papa's Rooms To The Very Room that he lived in a double and passed away in a job and that's a that's a special and I was right there is just like there's nobody there but a couple barometer is just kind of like closing up for the night that place is no place on earth like that on my dad there's a photograph

 66666666666 bad number 108 maybe 108 okay
 44433
 777 Rodger Tompkins thinks
 okay text 6 okay so we are allowed Mirage is teaching a bunch of five-year-olds and they're listening attentively never try to teach five-year-olds it's not easy you got to lose your got a really loosen up the reins but it seems like by his present people are just like attentive even amongst five year olds or some 50
they won't give you the time of day but it's certain people will talk to them I'll just do just become silent and internal and listen Okay text sex every human being as we do text 5 and then we did
 okay I was backing up and talked about doing it yes if we never be there for a while in material existence by a person fully competent to distinguish wrong from right my must Endeavor to achieve the highest goal of life here we go again there's like priorities in bathing culture there is a system there is a Direction they must must Endeavor to achieve the highest goal of life as the body is Stout and strong and is not embarrassed by dwindling he's about five years olds Stout and strong no five-year-olds are going to dwindle Casteel just yesterday cuz she was telling me yeah I walked
Angel Barefoot and I was like I'll really it hurts my feet you know as we get older we can do last week and do less our bodies become less useful and often times unless you're my mom who's got no aches and pains you know it is tougher to be in the body so he's giving us advice while you're healthy take advantage of this there's going to be a time when you're not healthy right when your body is hurting and your mind is disturbed by your pain wheat we have people in our life that we love that are suffering from chronic pain chronic sickness and it's hard to meditate when your mind is there while you're healthy the Bible times giving us a warning sign here while you're healthy I'm looking around a bunch of healthy faces
 take it seriously Rodger Tompkins House of Payne Timothy Tucker I'm looking at you guys right now take this seriously the box I'm speaking to us now and now it's going to break down in your life into little portions
 ready for Texas
I guess I just going to say this chapter the very first words that prolonged spoke some of that property would quote often kumara at Red Frog know that one who's who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of life from the very beginning of Life in the shelves up and it probably says from the tender age of childhood we should actually begin the spirit to train you know we should not not not waste any time and I can in this has already know this okay we've blown it okay we blowed it so that will ruin your life the best time to plant a nut tree
 what's the seven years to graduate best time to plant one is today meeting wherever you're at we're getting into this and we
seen people transform their lives even starting late in their spiritual practice and sometimes it takes that ripened fruit so to speak to be like yep I totally get this because when you're at the peak of material enjoyment and you hear the Barbra Tom throw mud at the concept images of like what are they talking about why these people so negative but your world is great but when you been through it and you've had your heart broken and you've lost your wealth and then you are you struggle with your career or your help and then you hear the material that the bag of time say something like the material world is riddled with pain your real-life yep I can identify with that oh yeah I get that and then you're like what do you say what what are you promising here I can get very serious about this right now and they tried to experience the joy of inner satisfaction instead of external titillating the census
yeah that Vanessa thing because we get trained really well we get trained in from you is how can you satisfy the senses that's that's like you know child will think that way naturally and if it's even at that time in you know here where will you know in The Vedic Paradigm the ideas that at the age of eight you go to the home of the Goodburger home of the group in the early in the morning and you get trained up you would actually go out door-to-door for should go there and you know it rained up in yoga in philosophy chant mantras memorizing stuff things like that you know
 and then you go out and beg you actually go door-to-door and you know it was like a very Noble thing to do you know if you know our teacher yeah you know who see that now on the message board let's see how many people do that at eight years old what were you doing
8 years old write it on the board Whiting army men on fire at 8 gasoline fireworks and firecrackers at blow up dolls I wasn't getting into my spiritual life
 so so you know you would you would do that you said yeah you know that everyone knows the noble teacher you know everyone else has benefited from there and that teacher has no regular paycheck right it ended the run in a little school there they need to see you know they need some donations so you go around and you collect or you collect firewood you know yet so that so that the show if you're not reading between the lines yet cuz Steve is asking you to go out and beg for him that was not what I said I need some fire for my wood stove so that's what we're talking about here so but the point is this
 you'd be trained early on to Tender stand that my happiness will not be found
through mere sense gratification the ballot this outside yeah yeah that didn't actually that it's normal to control the senses it's Noble to sacrifice one's time and energy off-road or higher cause you get trained in that you know and in the end that's how you train the mind from beginning otherwise you let that thing built up its muscles and it gets much hotter which reminds me of a nugget I once heard
 from desha for the day I said we'd a bag of the clatter I did it while he was okay but this is from geisha kelsang gyatso
 it was a Buddhist
oh, okay. If lunch for one parent Lee he said no matter how many possessions we acquire will not provide us with any lasting happiness and freedom nothing it doesn't matter how many on the contrary it is often our pursuit of material possessions that causes our problems and this is the part would really ties in I mean even that's very profound yeah if we want ultimate happiness and freedom from suffering we must engage
 in the Supreme practices of training the mind there is no other way except so boxy boxy from the Buddhist right yes well it's grew out of them the same text so you know 7 I love your I love you
that in but I love your point about how you're training for hearing truth from childhood acting on it from childhood you don't have any option that's what Dad and Mom were told me to do so that's what I'm doing but then you get into this realm where your quote off the leash and you're just now you're going to get married there going to be a family. We started engage in the family life and with that comes a special nowadays like kids and what kids are doing and what school are they going to go to and what sports are they going to do and where we got to go on Holiday Inn vacation in
 but what happens is you can't help yourself but getting drawn into material Direction and collecting stuff and then there's this idea of your living not in the now like you were as a child but you're like what you got a plan and we need some stuff put aside for later and that's all normal
a household need some insurance in case things go wrong you need some Savings in case Things Fall Apart and I would get sick and you got to watch out and set it to stockpile some food perhaps or whatever it be
 but that comes out to see what kind of boy she's the apocalypse Queen she's got no no that's you know it's her she could I know but for me I never thought I mean I bought bulk but it was just for me if she would but there comes a time where these things reawakened in that could be the time you start to get yes you start to get old you start to you know where
about Lala Babu the businessman a very wealthy Bengali businessman and the sweeper woman said hey the Sun is setting move along and he took that as some childhood aphorism of life is ending what the hell are you doing with your life and sometimes a podcast and was just like out
 any member of the genealogies that's right and he was like yeah yes the Sun is setting the Sun is setting you know he's healthy looks great he's got no he's got nothing The Chronic but he's 75 years old now and he's going to know what yes this is the age and sometimes people just died why are they taking this more seriously and he's like I'm staying in Bern Avenue
I'm saving David I'm going to dial this in and we need to hear this when we're healthy
 we need that was paralyzed point he was saying 25 years old not When We Were Young we got our life ahead of us but we can't waste any time because this shouldn't live with such a great opportunity. Don't wait till your dying and in pain right
 will you be there yesterday and so I was flying back now there was no turbulence at all crying and I was listening to some reasonably spiritual podcast and then I started diverging and I was like you know I'm not falling asleep do I have any type of Monday and enjoy it on my phone and I was watching Flight of the Conchords plane started Landing
high winds in Upstate New York right now and the plant we are very low I forgot to land but the laugh with the television show but the plan is like are we going to die now and I'm watching a comedy while the plane is that how I'm going to leave is that going to be my legacy rocking that died watching comedy and is going to even out I'll bounce out so I just kept on watching the, they laughing house like this material existence people are just laughing and enjoying life while their soul is being who knows what's going to happen to their soul and I was like okay Mara TV shows over we're chatting over time prayers right now and like me and Mary I just started chanting you got to start locking into a burned oven. I want to ask you a question so you mention this the Sun is setting is kind of an affirmation
 no it's a
 best formation
so my question is do you have any affirmations that you apply regularly in your life
 I didn't say a probation but are there phrases you mean
 yeah what you did say affirmation but any case that's neither here nor there in that formations yeah yeah you know what I've done in my life I put in different like
 he called a holiday a little holiday in my day like in the morning operabase and seized to Guru around the deities you know what I mean like wake up call for the same thing that's something I don't know if their formations but I don't think he even had that affirmations just when she's
said that it's sort of like it triggered something in her him but you said it was like 1. I'm just running with a dragon
 well I guess it like some some statement from the body of a time I'm sure there's something I'm sure there's a lot I'm sure I could say something like like you know you're in the kitchen and you know making eating a snack late at night hey wrap it up it's time to sleep
 change my life
 what you know because what we're hearing about here is that you know that the Mind needs to be controlled right there dude that's what he had to do with the Supreme practices of training the Macho how do you train it means like it's training means like they're training a dog you know it wants to go this way and you kind of instructed to do that when you do repeatedly and after a while it begins to learn to naturally do that right now
 and mine is like that too
and people do use affirmations like this is a popular thing that you know honestly
 a lot of them in my mind a little wishy-washy kind of like in the bell bottom have to do with like a self-worth or something like that you know like you are beautiful and you are you know something like that you know
 could you tell yourself you are loved you are low do you want to hear my information yes I'm having affirmation that I used to know how people say I am loved I am you know I am a self-worth issues we say something like I am very small but my sound like that mine it just
strictly with controlling the mind when it's going places I don't want to go because it does it is programmed to go different places to to either either to contemplate the object to the census or to criticize someone or to be critical in ways that it'll want to be different throughout the day several times of the day and my mind's going to want to go somewhere
 I don't want to let it go I get you I get you now I want to hear yours but I do have a bunch of these I do have and want to hear yours okay do you want me to go first you want to go for you go first you go first okay I have one is the one that I really live by the most
 it's as simple as we don't think like that we don't think like that little ass for that formation but we'll take the five worst it's a problem but I don't think house that was hungry
no but we don't sit and when I say we
 who do you think I mean when I say we
 did the bike shop Community I mean yes to that but I'm even a little more specific than that
 just so fat
 I could have waited there for a really long time I just let there be a lot of data are there do you remember what my information was yeah we don't think like that okay now who's the week for me the Wii its you know it has to do with the men that trained me and you know it and and
 but also be on that like that the group r a i like another words
I'd like when I would go before my girl right and stand before him and serve him is so hot I had to lift my Consciousness to a certain level he was very intolerant
 to anything else you know and not only the fact that he was intolerant to but I would have been embarrassed to be
 attached shop near a game you have to show up in your A-game and end in to be part of that community and to be around him or to be around great Souls that I admire now. They even if they tolerate you not being on your A-game you're not going to show up but you got to show up on your A-game for 4 p.m. for devotees in your life people have taught you things and loved you even people that are just like they put in their time and bhakti even if I not that connected with them I go up to them and say how are you I appreciate what you did
initiating you got to show up on your A game for a game
 does everything look at Paca
 yeah it's in my mind I'm not there
 then I'm really having enter that Community because it's a community of of Remembrance in meditation and focus on spirit and especially on Krishna so if I have a Lusty totally distracted materialistic in in her body
 right then I'm not part of that I'm really having any of that Community least not deeply at least not if if so only superficially get rid of lust if you want to enter the Puckett Community Ed and Ed is it so that means not just those people that trained me who have such gratitude toys but it also means
previous acharya's the six want me to bring you know the show The Profit I should have bought your Sonata starts by that you don't like need to be part of that I have to tell my mind we don't think like that
 you know we don't think we don't know and it's so fast and so strong
 because as soon as I say it
 I know that if I if I don't gain control I'm a I'm like a
 show bottle artificial plastic so called about the practitioner sure you know and I don't want to live that life
 and so that's like that's one method you know of my time in the training the mind yet but I would like to hear you're well whenever I'm dealing and tough relationship relationship relationship I do the trade your expectations
appreciations that's a big day when you're really like frustrated or really want to take this person down to really not happy with the way people's behavior is flip it and just meditate on their good qualities let me ask you something that saves me a lot now that's a great thing to be a lot of pain but I want to ask you something here cuz I was thinking something and I want to see if it's entered your life to my thought was theirs there's different formations that are out there and some of them are popular like like that or like a ace God like a whole ton of really good that he's got the best it's worth joining AAA just for me
 but I but I was thinking
 that's when you come up with it on your own when it's a product of your own realization
 perhaps that's a deeper stronger more meaningful
affirmation if it grows out of your own sometimes yeah so do you have any of those
 yeah I mean
 sometimes if there's something attractive could be a person or it could be a thing or will you feel like you place any now and will do I just say won't give me what I want won't give me what I want won't give me what I want what I want will give you a call right now and now that's a nice it's a good one there so just became won't give me what I want if you got to keep it concise after
 weather people whether people think of me is none of my business what other people think these are nice I could have her as my status
could you repeat that what other people think of me is none of my business because a lot of times we're really
 we're really overly concerned about what other people think about us and especially people like got issues with us it's none of my business what people think of me my business is to think what like what is Krishna think of me my behavior also have a lot of aphorism is around like criticism it's almost like if I get into it and I will get into a critical mode of other people or other devotees my head is just filled with like red flags it seems like devotees don't criticize we don't criticize you can discern but don't discern but don't criticize that's semi-automatic we don't think like that we don't pretty sad we just discern meaning UK don't throw like I'll just do anything
 probably only buddy walk all over me it's not you just Zurn but you don't criticize
