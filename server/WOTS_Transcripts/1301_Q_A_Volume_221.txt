 Alex Cora
 thank you my old friend in case you are listening podcast you know any started sharing all these different things like the original singer of
call Mags if you don't know he's like if we can go hardcore scene devotees originally they disappeared and he's back for months together so we've been friends before word of all these as devotees and you know it as brahmacharya is now again and he comes to the buggy Center practically every day so anyway you said Saturday and he was Sharon different things about it you know that was kind of showing that he's been listening what's the squirrel pulls you away and Chase the squirrel because it's crazy and I was rocking it out it goes off on a tangent that's called a squirrel and I do it occasionally to you do you know I think it's really beautiful sanguine point to make that sometimes we just get off our path for some reason or another some trick of chance
 Krishna never forgets you if you're going through some low time right now you study
Christian is not just you reaching up to Krishna Krishna is always reaching for you he's extending towards you Christians are real Dynamic force of being that doesn't forget you and even though sometimes I know sometimes like these fishermen they catch a fish and they just let the line go out very very far in the fish tanks on free down free it's really just wearing down the fish and then fish images
 Wheels I'm in real-time a rather okay and still in the same way sometimes we get this deep inspiration bhakti and then sometimes when we lose our inspiration sometimes you can just get into Maya and that's Krishna just letting out the string and and we exhaust yourself in the material world and we start this thing what am I doing Emily finally just gave up and Christmas tree also we should intensely pursue materialistic Pleasures is that your message the message is don't worry about it
but sometimes you got to do it the foolish way and you got to get beat up a little bit we don't want to do that there are those going to the question, but here's the first ones from our old friend Sherry attic from Oceanside California or there's a big fire there yesterday on the on the docks on the boardwalk
 wish everybody well here hello hello hello what's your body yoga Krishna conscious elevator pitch
 I'm starting a new job as a school librarian at an Episcopalian school and while they know I'm not Episcopalian if they ask me my spiritual
Mission I'm wondering if you have an easy way to describe this path for people who might not be familiar with body yoga to understand it
 I definitely need to be sensitive to be religious to be sensitive to the religious foundation of the school so I didn't want to be proselytizing but I'm just looking for a simple explanation for those who might not understand thanks very much
 I wonder if they could say oh you're fired I can't do that maybe they could but I believe in 33 million demigods telephone to elevator pitch means if you got like if you're trying to explain it to someone in the course of an elevator ride do you have that much time
 what's up you said what would you say that back to you about Krishna Consciousness however you want to know what's your elevator pitch right now
salt in it it it it it says you have to use your elevator pitch according to your audience so I wouldn't give an Episcopalian School the same elevator pitch I would give a hardcore person if the money's going for the music stand to hear there's a lot of different elevator pitches out there and hit the one to the hard-court let me hear the one to the person that's into what are they called
 that metal weather like this world is hell it's a place of suffering something like that do you think this world as hell yeah I think for a person put out a grindcore song or not those kind of known for doing like a
aren't you at some point in the old days yeah I was a growler do you still do that when you do your reunions do you make that time if I can get it out of me I do it because you want to come out all right what's your what's your elevator pitch elevator praise for her I would keep it super simple to say I'm a very spiritual person to I follow up in 10 Hindu tradition we believe in believing we actually believe in Jesus
 you may cuz I don't know a lot of times Christians as soon as you say anything other than Jesus you could just let you know I'm really into Jesus some really really you might try the Jesus route I'm really really into Jesus but but thirty-three million other gods to also there's other Messenger apps including human ones that have come to save me
Mockingbirds talk and rivers and monkeys you I agree 100% where you started working out which was that in one sense it does depend on the audience that the particular angle that you take an Episcopalian Church from what I understand are known for being quiet inclusive and and so you might take that into account where is like if I stream to a southern baptist like a whole another approach right yeah the approaches let him go but don't even priests to I'm serious there certain people I'm not going to preach to because well they've asked you what tell me about your face
 and what do you say to the southern baptist to the southern baptist truthfully sometimes you just add jatate them and then they can make a phone out there today but they made her since your inquiry Waters that would require some space
and I believe in the Hindu tradition and a lot of people think Hindi Traditions garlic Hagan's or are pagans but I believe in the special branch of the Hindu tradition that believes in one Divine God just not yours that's where they lose their mind that's where Christians lose her mind. She said they said they are open to students of all religions are there known as being not necessarily Pesca palean to school okay where do you start asking him where do you start
 yeah you trying to explain all this and I think for almost any audience this is generally good place to start the soul is eternal in the body is temporary just a temporary vehicle for the body right that's where Faith begins are that's where we can start the explanation
okay
 and that you know if I speak into the Piscopo alien I might say this life is an opportunity to reconnect to God through love that's the essence of our faith like that like a simpler then I would think the question would come
 likely would come it all or the conversation would likely go towards will argue Hindu right like if they knew was coming from idiot like always right out of the gate that you know that's where the conversation would would progress towards and so let's say they say are you Hindu and you're in that elevator what you going to say
 well
 it's hard one because there's a lot of explaining to do and I think this is really helpful for this I once saw an article on this question are you in to ask to some of this practicing Krishna bhakti
 and the answer
said well
 if you have do you have a short time or long time for me to explain this to you because if it's if it's a short answer I might just go ahead and say Yes Hindu that'll help you kind of get some categorisation of what texts are sacred to me and you know that the tradition that I'm connected to but if we have a longer time to explain this then you know I could explain that our teachings derive from the same text that are sacred to Hinduism but that when you get to the essence of these teachings they transcend all sectarian considerations so in that sense I would not say that I am a Hindu cuz you know do they believe in you know that there's this belief that it's not something that you can convert from what I am by Nature
 is you know I said at 11 so I'm glad that there's no converting from that or to that or anything like that so it becomes deeper question you know there's no
we've just forgotten and the teachings that I practice or to help us remember that we are tiny parts of God and we're going to remember I always just say that I believe I'm struggling Spirits all trying to connect with God anywhere I can and try to get truth wherever I can get it from there but tell me about your pay when I come take a look at it does it through meditation through Montrose through sound for singing
 and out what would you what are your beliefs on God like how do you understand God God is the source of everything God is a loving friend God is a good god is eternal God God God is a is benevolent what do you believe in more than one God
 now there's one supreme god because when I see the teachers of Hinduism seems like there's many others many many energies because we understand even in this
there's many beings even my God there's different this Krishna this is the one God but then there's other higher Powers just like the higher than God on the highest power there's one higher power is one God's but it's higher power higher than me and will you in this is why I don't believe in higher Powers higher than any other higher power will there is a sample I could tackle you and beat you up I'm a higher power or more mathematical or more musical than me there's different higher Powers even
 even in your classroom or your church or you're even in that elevator there's fire powers and then there's
powers like elements like the wind the Sun the rain the moon the the the win the ocean the ocean has a higher power than me so we may not see the ocean as a being but that we could study every that we consider everything has personality so they're all going so yeah so what the whole idea of Christ being against the pagans in one sense
 we also see beings in the material elements and we appreciate them like Christ we didn't Oz them a supreme and worship one supreme god
 okay I think if if you start but if you start by saying you know fundamentally our belief is that the soul is eternal that you teach you our Eternal i m and that the body that were in it's just a temporary vehicle for it and that you know we we tend to identify with the
we think I'm a man I'm a woman in black and white American I'm missing two but these are all temporary identifications and this life is an opportunity to reach connect to God through love then the question is going to eat then the question is using to be or you're Hindu or it might be will what do you who do you believe is God
 and I think that's when you go right there like you did I think cuz if they think that you're you know if it was Are You Hinder than we could say you know you could answer like we said you know it
 in one sense it might be helpful for you to categorize it is Hinduism but when you really get into the essence of teachings it's something deeper than that so if you have a short time I might say you do if you were to study this in the University of it would fall under the category of Hinduism but if you want to go deep into the tradition itself you see that it transcends those kind of I want to share something about that but before I do that I just want to say that I said what you believe about God you said and then I think
point of this is my assistant we believe in and that there's one God but that one got manifest in many different ways three in particular that I want since everything is the energy of gods who won since everything is God and that girl said that the God is within the heart of every living being always there is a friend communicating that we can turn to but that also got can be done as a person then then you given them something something to walk away with I think if you do that sure sometimes when we do go to Hinduism it puts them oh I've got you figured out already write a Harry Krishna I've got you figured out that's why that point of this is important because they think that means you believe in many gods or that you gave you the goddess and in personal in that in there for you can also say it and if it goes there
 then you can stay within this broader tradition their jelly two schools of thought
 right one is that God is not personal just a Divine energy and you merge into that but the tradition that I that I follow is that God
how is God and I am always me and the goal of life is to reconnect through love not to merge into God and become gun if they want to accept it if they want to accept it and want to listen to W like yeah okay I like that but if they actually are asking you because they're trying to figure out so they can preach to you they're not going it's not going to sit well with the one thing I want to mention about the Hindu Monica
 yeah is this is really interesting now if you read all the proper books and all these conversations and all of that when you find him speaking about the term Hindu
 far more often than not he's going to deny that were Hindus because he's speaking to that Essence now occasion will find him using that usually he'll say we are Hindus on occasion he doesn't more generally he doesn't and one time I was I was having a conversation with the person who
that I think the president like the head of a of a Hindu organization like American Hindus or something something like this
 and they were asking me they were there kind of expressing some frustration
 with propods I guess they would see it as like a trail
 trail of pizza betrayal to Hinduism a trail but more like they almost felt like it was unfair to use the Hindu title when it's convenient and not at other times and maybe primarily to not like why doesn't he just come out and just embrace it like the rest of us and you know like that
 and
 and I said well he was trying to communicate this the essential message
I felt it was in order to do that he had to speak that way and that they weren't satisfied but something happened later that made me really sad I didn't I didn't bring it up again but at some point later it might have been a year later I don't remember how far later that person reached out to me because they were creating some promotional content like video content
 and they wanted to show African American
 Hindus okay they wanted to make that as part of their promotional content and they turned to me and said could you help us with that
 and I thought to myself later I thought to myself well here you go
 if if you if you look at the different Hindu organizations I say in America how many of them have
African Americans prominently participating they practically have none they have people from India participating right where is sugar pop had presented he presented the bug of agita and srimad bhagavatam in the same text in a way that people that had no ethnic connection to it would understand its Essence so it didn't matter if they're black or white or Indian or Asian or Asian or Chinese or Japanese or South American you know
 it didn't matter because he he had his way of speaking to the essence of it that people understood this is entirely relevant to me
 where and when he did that I would argue better than anyone
 and therefore when you needed African American Hindus quote-unquote Hindus you had to come to us you come to us
you want African American Hindus what Chinese and do you come here I can put it is right on that point because he didn't say we are Hindus he said we are not these bodies
 we are at we are Beyond Hinduism we are the Eternal we are that sparkle spiritual energy that you know that can be a Hindu today and not going to Christian tomorrow externally but we are always that's also eat his so more often than not she'll probably speaking on that level like we are not here to because he wanted to you wanted to communicate this so I didn't I didn't like all the person up on it but afterward I have to ask my thought about that I said
 there you go there's answering yeah
 essential thing we are Spirit you can always change your religion you can't change the fact you can even say I have no religion or I'm an atheist you still can't get out of being a spirit saw your body is animated by spirit and she can't give that up
you can't be converted to that right way to put it up that was useful Sherry anak but we took a shot at it later pitch. Say something quick for 1
 I just got off the elevator
 all right that question this is from Brent
 this joint question between Scott no East, Scott heating and plumbing now he's signing us name Scott Plumbing but I think I'm going to change it to I don't like Scott Plumbing I don't like Scott heating so me and Mary came up with Scott hot Scott are you sure you want to go that way. Scott would we used to have a hot oil is hot Cindy yoga or Cindy Hot Wheel change the you change that now you're going with it with Sky
she named herself Hudson deal with and she unnamed it now she's about to yoga. Scott
 and Leslie been take us to finish age group of a question it's just thank you so much for your devotional service the community of created through the podcast has been so impactful to our spiritual lives because of your podcast you have brought us together in the bonds of friendship even though we live in both sides of the country we have started to read the date on a charge for me to Auntie Lila to supplement our study of the human body with Tom
 in the beginning of the change time to try to charge me to the author Christian. Copy Rodger gives proof that she Tanya is Krishna in chapters 2 3 4 we haven't seen and maybe it isn't forthcoming maybe it's forthcoming a discussion about the direct connection between Lord she Tanya and Krishna it seems as though everyone knows he is Krishna
and yet in the Tri-County church and Rita in the 7 chapter it seems that he doesn't know his own status this is where we get confused to CEI Tanya intrinsic Lee know that he is Cristiano or alternately will see underwear so we could experience your love Dolores Catania appear in order to feel or experience with devotees feel we both have a hard time wrapping their heads around as being the devotee and the object of devotion of us at the same time and then tell me about these things this is where this is where the mine should be engaged not in with the Kardashians are doing is very interesting also and I cannot liberate level about liberate you we feel like if the object knows that they are the devoted as well
 their devotion will not be a speed or thanks again for all your service in the time and effort you put
play this podcast explain a little bit more about this just for people that this might be new to I think I figured I'd yeah yeah this whole concept is sort of anomaly within bhakti within there's a there's a huge tradition where we follow or cheat on you and then there's other traditions of body where they don't know about where to tell you except where she tell you
 yeah well what are you going to say about I just say that to okay so just real quick let's say that there's this in one sense has the most esoteric aspect of our whole tradition of the tradition of Krishna bhakti
 in the wake of following the path of Sri chaitanya SRI chaitanya
 many people see him as a great saying to Great spiritual leader but within this tradition we see him as he is Krishna sometimes you can say Avatar of Krishna who came with a special mission
the previous question we believe in one God but we believe that he manifests in infinite ways all kind of ways we're also real careful about that we look to the sacred texts to say how he appears and when he appears and for what purpose he appears there's a lot of information on that ingrate Saints and have taken pains to kind of lay all this out for us very clearly so they're not any you know any clown you can walk around and see that they are God which they do all the time still doing that okay so so but this is like the most esoteric special manifestation where Krishna
 as the center of all existence he is the object of the love of every living being right
 we are the subject of that love we feel that love and he's the object of it every living beings love is directed towards that one being and he receives that love feels that love enjoys that love appreciate that love
that these exchanges will ever really all that he's about and all that he's interested in but of all living beings ride her her love
 for him is the u.s.a. the highest the deepest and most intense that the most magnificent you know you could we could describe this and that love when he experiences her love
 not only does he enjoy that but he also begin to try to wrap his mind around something his in this is how it seems like she has more love then I'm experiencing more enjoyment from loving Ali ride like she she experiences a higher level of pleasure loving me
 now I use my phone's being loved by her I'm going to use that analogy I use about being in the van so I think I'll be used it with you recently like when you're when you're in love and your fans
are looking forward to hearing you maybe they know you're coming to town so all week that we playing your records and music on Spotify that thinking about you you got the airplane the records are enjoying with their friends are getting ready to go to the performance they're talking about it in the car there so I hope they play the song I hope they play that song The Following social media and then there's so much exciting when you get on the stage or the curtain opens they're at and I know being in the band you're on towards like okay you're exhausted even traveling you know and okay we going to get up do a sound check and then okay for 45 minutes or an hour and a half we're going to get a hard-working to perform and it is a great pleasure to perform it's a great joy if you're a musician and you get to write songs and so many people here and so many people to reciprocating there's great pleasure there but if you look at the audience
 they're enjoying more than you are there actually really enjoy your daddy know you during your work and you feel appreciated
but they are actually enjoy more so I get this understanding alert attorneys like that I love him there they're loving me there reciprocating with my love this is beautiful what's it like to be a bam this is what your timing is special manifestation the idea that to be the subject of love
 in other words to be the one that possesses love in one's own heart is a more intense experience than being the object of love being the one that that the love is directed towards Crystal recognizes that and then and then he recognizes a problem because love of God is the most intense love and I'm the only one that can feel it cuz I am the object of his love of God I'm not the subject of love God and in Radha he says he's seen this Divine mystery
 secret something she's experienced that I could never experience what is a like
so in order to experience that
 he has an internal reason an extra reason is coming she cheats on you it one is so that he can teach bhakti spread bhakti Center but his internal reason his own personal internal reason is to experience what rot experiences
 what is it like to love Krishna in the mood of Radha and so he comes as a devotee of Christian that should tell you okay so then that leaves us to a question she's saying as we read his biography in the text about his life it seems like everybody around him knows that he's actually Krishna not everybody but a lot of people do and but it seems like he doesn't know it or sometimes he seems to know it like sometimes
 she gets into a deep conversation with someone and they come to a conclusion that conversation and they revealed to them that I am Christian I'd like he gives them a vision he gives them some spiritual vision in manifest some fantastic
past time for you grows other arms are manifested Lord Rama or or or you know he hears that you're something interesting right when he's a little boy
 but if we go to the life as you do Tanya when is Young he was an experienced in the mood of Radha he was kind of more displaying the mood of Krishna like he was mischievous you know who was in trouble and so I did and look we see there's exams like when the barometer came the one time in his home he's just an adorable little boy at the time adorable like Krishna like unlimitedly captivating and Charming little boy
 and a visitor comes to the home and shoot on his parents kind of set him up he has his little Pooja rituals that he does every day and he cooks you know as part of that you had to make a little offering to his little DD of Krishna and
he spends time and effort and he cooks and him dead as he's making the offering Christian a little little me my little little RJ Tanya comes in he starts eating the off in when you're not supposed to do it screws up the whole ritual right it's all meant to be offered to Krishna not someone else starts eating off the plate that's a little kid comes in here and starts to eat the offer and ends that the parents are upset oh no he's good at the whole offering that the visitors like it's okay he's a little boy we can't blame him let me cook again he cooks again he's chanting the prayers to Christian to make an offering and large it only comes and eats again it happens to three times and like that in in and shoot a Chinese pear so I can stop showing this easy or they're getting upset with what I don't punish the boy he is you know what, he's just a boy he does have one more time it's like really late at night
 and he's you know been cooking for his fourth time or something like that right he's making the offerings chance prescriptions or cheat on you cuz I start seeing it again they thought they had him locked away and he couldn't get
manifest and any type of wire is everybody complaining in case he called for me to attend he made the offering and I came and I took it drives like you say I'm Krishna and you're calling Krishna so early in his life as a boy he calmly indicated I am Krishna no one could believe it
 but when he takes but it was later in his life after his father passed away he went to Gaya he came back in there he met his girl he got the Mantra and that's when he began to manifest not so much the mood of Christian with the mood of Rod
 and that's when he began to have those internal experiences that he had come as she cheat on you to experience
 and now he doesn't walk around saying I am Krishna it doesn't matter if I could someone says somebody that he covers his ears right he doesn't want to hear that because his whole thing is he wants to feel with rata feels he wants to be the devoted
he does want to be cream enough so is that just something that he's just trying to forget or is it something that you know what what's a chick Tony charge Mutual speak about is that
 Krishna exist
 for the purpose of love and when it comes to shoot a Tonya he's existing to understand rotten and experience Rod has love
 and it'll put in either case in order to fully experience that love he has to forget I am God even when he's playing with the gopis in brindaban
 it's the inconceivable spiritual potency of what's called Christmas yoga Maya need the energy
 you can send the elude the energy that the illusory energy that makes him that brings him together in love it's yoga means to connect right so you old
Maya means that it is Christmas on potency but it supposed to see that he voluntarily
 allows himself to be influenced by He makes himself vulnerable to that potency so that even he forgets I am Krishna because only one he forgets I'm Christian can I become completely absorbed in the Lila completely absorbed in the play right so yogamaya is this is from Chey Tony Church misses yogamaya is the internal policy that makes the Lord forget himself
 right
 or it is also been there in the spiritual loving sentiment induced by yogamaya potency both Lord Krishna and the damsels of Russia they forget themselves and spiritual rapture
 so in order to become fully deeply absorbed you know Krishna has if Chris is going to love Radha and experience all the moves of a lover
 that he's got experience separation got experience the pain of
losing one's lover end the end the joy of regaining that lover you know if he's going to do all that and become deeply absorbed in the Lila in the play he has to forget in the way that he forgets is through his own the power of his own potency yogamaya
 so this is all so this is a tiny shirt and Rita Avila 643 says the transcendental devotional service of the Supreme personality of God it is so ecstatic love for Christmas so ecstatic that even the Lord himself plays the part of a devotee forgetting himself to be the Supreme he personally teaches the whole world how to render the Supreme how to render service to the Supreme purse. They've got it so yes he forget sometimes he remembers
 but when he's in the Deep mood Rod he's forgotten and he's forgotten by the potency his own potency the older my potency
 well it helps a fill his purpose in for Phyllis inner desire
of course the first purpose your veggies to spread love of God had and it should be understood that anybody is listening to the show you've somehow been netted you've been hooked by that first purpose the reason why we know about boxes sitting in the middle of Minneapolis or Colorado or Mexico or somewhere in Europe is because she Tonia is exercising that desire for that very very deep philosophical and potent love of God to be spread throughout the world we wouldn't have it if it wasn't for lunch at Target there's no way I would sort of take up Hindu rituals and practice understanding a high purpose and will learn to Tiny did is he taught such essential teachings that we can have elevator pitches that appeal to anybody is open-minded anybody's open-minded when you say I'm a spirit so we believe that everybody is a spiritual
even the animals even the plants even the birds in the trees but we've all forgotten our identity and the process of religion is to help you remember so you can do that in any really just passed as long as you remember who you are and remember that were part of God and also don't cultivate some competition with some other like get rid of the hate if you can just stop criticizing and just take the sound of a holy name seriously you'll become elevated and all the coverings of the soul will melt away and he said it in such a way that's like when you hear it with an open heart and open-minded like that makes more sense than anything I've ever heard and and and that's why it's it it it it catches on like wildfire and will continue to catch on like wildfire and that's why it's it's it's War cheat on his desire for this to spread all over the world so I was get really inspired with or to Tanya when you're either pastimes are a little bit
lofty
 they're a little bit confusing but my strong faith realize that I wouldn't even be here where I am today I have a whole different life the whole different personality with whole different concept of God and spirituality if it was confirmed sheitana specifically appearing and having that part of his mission to break open the treasury of love and in distributed widely so we can we can understand in the right things are
 what is what is squirrel is connected what you were saying the first original question original question but I think something's got to be set because you could just throw tons of doubts on understand Christian about 10 minutes I could be easily minimized and sometimes
and so I had to just clarify if you're clear if you're here it's doodle or cheat on you if you love kirtan it's do Dolores Catania thank you all right you got 10 minutes for one more question
 in an animus question what are you hiding always the best kind of email have a lot of friends dealing with loved ones passing or preparing for the departure of loved ones from this world I hear a lot for my devoted friends share this kind of when I die take my ashes to the Thunder or take my ashes to the yamuna my question is why is this so significant if we are not the body why should it matter with the physical body goes after the soul leaves it it was ever
us it was never us to begin with it was just a means of transportation in this world I can understand me tanning while we are alive to be able to service
 but I can understand it while maintaining this body while we're alive to be of service and because it also houses the saw the part month but if the body is something that we have but it does not make us who we are and why is it important after death to be cremated and taken to these places question any good question. So yeah if if we're not these bodies which is where we began our whole philosophy right when we had the elevator pitch yeah we're not them at all then then once you leave that body you have no 0 connection with it so then why this tradition of burning the body than taking those Ashes to the holy River and why do you have to bring them to that spot when because
still have some connection with it you might as well I hope I'm not the body I know we're not the body were attached to the body so these are sort of metaphysical ways to help separate from the burning that does that that's the burning but why bring it to the to the holy River it's just sort of like to put icing on the cake was left of the body throw it in the ganga no trace of material energy on me I'm going to burn the bodies separate the subtle body from it and then whatever is left I want that thrown in the Holy place the one no connection of course we believe that we're not the body where krishna's devotee and Chris will just take care I believe that's true too if I driving on some Ravine on some Himalayan Road and my bus goes over a cliff and I died there and nothing happened so I don't my body
doesn't burn in a row I want to get my skin and various Mountain cats chew on my body I don't think that if I'm in a state of consciousness I don't think it's going to matter if I don't get burnt or not but if we have some type of governance over how we go that's the that's the way that's the way that the tradition is set up we still have ultimate faith in Krishna Christmas and take us home we could take us home but there's ways we relate with the material energy those rituals that we do that help
 make it easy for us in our passing essay this I think you kind of encapsulated it
 first let's say that for those that are following as we've been taught at against his father's issue to Tanya that she will prompt I presented these teachings to us this isn't a huge concern for us
now there going to be people with in Hinduism that say if you do this you are liberated yeah you will go and ask it has to be on your way there someone's carrying your ashes and they lose them or if they die or what oh no it's ruined everything you know we're not that we're not that concerned it has more to do with how we've lived in what our Consciousness is then this ritual being properly performed so it's not it's not a big crucial deal to assets one thing that being said just because you left your body
 does not mean that no one here that still here can do something that benefits you
 right lady we all we are all connected to God and people here thinking of you can't perform the ritual in the right Consciousness and you may benefit from it and that's kind of part of the idea here right
although you left your body we're taking you know we emphasize we're not the body a lot
 cuz probably did but is also part of a body that it is also part of our philosophy that there is a very real connection to the potty and I like at least for some time and the you know that body was that was our vehicle and in and I sent it it was relatively temporarily part of our identity and so we want it all to be offered in someone behind behind us will do that and make that complete and there is an idea that that completion is beneficial for the soul but again if we don't work in bringing it yeah that's a whole another question is this ritual for the person or is it for everybody that's doing the ritual now there's something there's a term
 am I set up vairagya
the renunciation at the burning God that that that there's there's it's a refers to the philosophical frame of mind
 that one feels gripped by when they witness the burning of a body in the end it's the tossing of the ashes into the water that it makes you a tends to make you very contemplatively and it tends to influence you to think of God Instinct of your life in relation to God and think about what's important and what's not important and so on so all the prayers and all the actions that ritual they actually are likely doing more for the people doing and witnessing the ritual for the person that is actually being done for sure so that's really important to me but I also share this last thing is that she'll probably
 he was more explicit.
 When it came to summon having pasta
he when he was giving instructions to his disciples he he didn't speak a lot about making sure their ashes get brought to the Ganges
 he's what he instructed his disciples to do was distributive Feast on the occasion of this person's departure
 that was the ritual he gave them to do right feed the violation of his own behalf of this person creative creative creative a beautiful Feast offered to Krishna so that it becomes presado behalf of The Departed Soul distribute that pursued him to the vice numbers just distributed to the to the devotees of God and the remembrances of all the devotees eating the prashad yeah so that had nothing to do with the body but it did recognize the idea that you can benefit someone who's already passed away and put profile you know all of these are part of the broader rituals of a Democrat
emphasize that part more than he did was like to get into the ashes getting the extra standards in the interesting it just shows when you make a
 committed step towards something Eternal like okay I'm going to I'm going to have a either feast or I'm going to have my actions sent in the ganga everybody engage in that Rachel is making bad if it is well it doesn't end the devotee always constantly giving and giving and giving having an anniversary of one's departure which is usually a sad day today of grieving we feel like it's a dark day is actually becomes a day of this person left this world it's a holy day and let's all honor or member in a room have some remembrance time and appreciation time it all becomes purifying and Lori Patton is sharing that she brought her parents Ashes to the Ganges and she was told as the ritual is being done
I assume by the priests that this would help her family for seven generations and
 that's what I said that you do the same things that we don't deny that but but when you get to the bar with time does this whole Seven Generations thing is also Revisited winter Lodge father ran across the pool was a straight-out demon in Demon recall you know her logic we was informed I was getting offered any Ben addiction that you want and even though his father was abusing him trying to kill him and now his father just been killed and provide was offered any benediction you want all you asked for was
 you know I'm just praying for my father for my father's spiritual benefit and he was he was told that already generations going forward and going backward have have been saved
because you brought their ashes anywhere I think that just could appear devotional circles because you are a devotee because of your Devotion to God you so you're saying I'm saying that I'm not denying that what what that that by doing that she did benefit family going in these directions I'm not denying that but the deepest benefit in the benefit that's a size when we get to the bottom of time which tends to minimize ritual and focus on devotion is actually your devotion that you have for God that is going to benefit your your your family in both directions far more importantly and significantly than any particular ritual
 okay great we're done but we still got to bring me to the ganga if I didn't get behind that face
when you get in the car and make sure they are dust and vacuum me up okay for I get to the ganga my dog sheds and we're back not tomorrow but the day after tomorrow Monday at 8 a.m. used to make sure you to join us anywhere you get audiobooks or anywhere do you order books you got Amazon and remember which of the sages the retreat in super so far we want to see you there me and Matt are going to be there I have a bicycle or looking forward to it Italy is happening so check out with us in this age of Splash events are witnessing the sages events at an ashram hassle to the Tuscany kiddos it's quite beautiful it's a little bit of everything you got the Beautiful
