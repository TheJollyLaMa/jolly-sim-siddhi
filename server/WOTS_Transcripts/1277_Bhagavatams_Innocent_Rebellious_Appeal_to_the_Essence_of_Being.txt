like your earrings
 heading out of here you can call them we noticed them
 nugget I got a nugget for you my friend is it from it is from Albert Camus what do you know that our come I knew he was he wrote The Stranger I know that he's strange request off a cliff people think it's suicide is one of those deep philosopher is considered an existentialist I think I'm not I haven't done any breathing show researchers you're right he's like an existentialist and you know they say that people you know go to Waze deep thinkers they either go to like what is this all about anyway why am I trying so hard to create meaning in this meaningless world I'm only here in this world for a moment in time and I'm getting so worked up about stuff it's almost like we talked about in the podcast a lot but then they end up with it's all nothing and then they realize I know positive alternative is no positive and they just like why even bother living and
and that makes sense an existential world so what you have to do is don't think too much or go deeper go deeper and think about the source of everything it's so sometimes that happens all so you can people like Leo Tolstoy great figure deep thinker but turn that towards Jesus and you know Eastern Orthodox religion and then you become like you use that great intelligence for Spiritual edification I think his most important work was the myth of Sisyphus
 hmmm oh yeah I think it's the stranger well but maybe I guess we just won't quit going to have to agree to disagree on that about it though but in any case that's that Mississippi of Sisyphus one is you know where you push the rock up to the top of the hill in a rose down then you got to go back and put that's right that's what your looks distance isn't it that's how he apparently
receive material existence is discontinuing if you do continuous suffering and there is truth in them I think I was an existentialist for one day in my life I've always been like God. Is I'm a God person okay but there was one day as I put this is nothing and it's it's a very depressing outlook on life and so an atheist will say say what you're trying to create meeting and you're trying to create meeting because there is no meaning and ultimately there is nothing what a horrible way to live your life first of all you don't even trip
 and then it's sort of like it if there actually is nothing than anything goes that it's like I'm going to turn around and punch you right in the face right now
 this is an excuse me well it doesn't matter. Do you understand just like Adams it doesn't matter that has no bite you in that world I could bite you right now and there's no nothing wrong with biting another person
standard of morality
 or anyting little scared of anything in the world where there's no meaning well there might be standards of some things but there's no more who sets the standard will you just a nature you can see certain standards but the water boil at a certain temperature it means nothing we don't we don't know what is right or wrong you are all the way there's no God that's for sure there's no up or down and left or right it's just perhaps survival of the fittest a little worked up because people
 you know in this world reteach well there is no God
that's the underlying statement It's Like Anything Goes
 when people are like well now we can add some like we can have some rules we can ask him for a week and I have some guardrails now why bother anything well they would say that why bother to make life better to make a six-year terms with the better is when we can do that together with no no I'm not playing your game I live in Anarchy world and will kill you know I'll kill you going to be okay good my crazy world of godlessness it's okay to kill everyone in agreement with you back to my old friend Andre from Andre Andre The Satanist either the leader of the Church of Satan New York like they're just like rebellious and I get that that is what a Satanist is it will only start
Church of Satan is again is that where they don't believe in Satan they're just trying to undo the Christian conditioning that they've been subjected to through I get the upside down Christian ritual but my point was when my friend was interviewed on on some radio in his whole point the whole point in the whole interview was how all moral standards are man-made that they have no existential true that there's there's nothing about them that isn't arbitrary but towards the end of the interview then the interview civil what about something like
 set child sexual abuse they can't live in that came off and I can't live in a bill have to put some more said mid that that is long and then we want you to meet that is wrong then you have to say by what Standard Bible standard it's really good did you hear about that or something like him
now in Idaho or something like that they they installed a Church of Satan you know where they worship the morning to go deity and they said Mom knows it's like we can have our we can have it we can have our religious thing here and they gave the religious permission to and then a Christian guy came and he be had it and he got arrested for it at our discussions today very interesting here every Act of rebellion expresses a Nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being now and yes you could go through like the people are rebelling about today I don't feel like doing but but you know like so I suppose the guys who are like four
climate change and they are like sitting in the road driving me crazy I'm starving I got to go to the bathroom because there's a problem in the world you created another problem you create another problem to get our point across but anyway that aside my personal opinion aside
 Camille would say Every Act of rebellion expresses a Nostalgia for innocence Because deep down in their heart what do you like them or hate them there's like this desire for an appeal to the essence of being like hey we got a really care about us as living entities in this world that's what they're trying to say
 and it says every actor Bill and expresses a Nostalgia for an innocence and an appeal to the essence of being so there's this
 urgency in Urdu
finding an urgency to go to what we are at our berry or which is we're all Spiritual Beings and we're creating elf ourselves here and this is their idea of getting awareness of it there's some there's some beauty in it I think that's part of the idea is whether it whether the Rebellion is well conceived or not I think what he's saying is that it's it stems from a Nostalgia for innocence it stems from
 the desire to be good right and generally that innocence has something to do with selflessness sure you know what type of Detachment other was an innocent person hasn't become captivated by the things that corrupt us in life and your hand and sometimes like the greed the anger the Lost there's some there's something more important I could be
 whatever they're fighting for or or the fighting there fighting whatever
what at whatever has corrupted that
 for the collective good sure I just me and my desires there's a collective good even if it's even if it's an individual thing too I think another here's here's what I was thinking of in relation to this is that sometimes even
 the what's placed with created in order to bring us forward to bring us towards some good sometimes those structures actually ultimately hold us back so in other words there may be a certain morality
 let's listen to use a Precision Society might create a certain standard of Morality In order to get us tickets to to protect us from our lower nature sure but there may be something still higher than that and to reach that hire you need to rebell now what we have here is in Lorena Bobbitt I'm as there's provide a lot as innocent as innocent as the
I call it the the newly fallen snow right like perladas just like you are to the core PC a five-year-old that's it is our only very innocent I mean there's sometimes a little rattled but there's a good reason these saintly a saintly child of the poor lad is entirely sane and and but he's entirely rebellious
 you know his his parents and his teachers they're letting out what they think is for the good of him in the good of their people sure and even you don't even some of it is kind of like why reasonable sure but she knows that that that the essence of life the essence of it all you know you could be pies you could be good you can reap good results and create a stable Society
alive knows there's something deeper and that has to do with the essence of like being the connection with our very source and then that connection in love so I love and connection is like the essence of all big and he's striving for that it's an active it's an act of rebellion what he's doing to cheat and I think the whole body with Tom is kind of that it's we have that they what is a good what you're saying like the analogy is it's so crazy what we've done too because Randy cuz you pues giving and the teachers are giving birth like good structured ideas you know you know we go on vacation from Super Soul and why were they while we're gone
 like a family just moved in a couple families and we come back and they're like cooking breakfast and what are you doing here they just assumed like squatters were squatters on planet Earth and we've assumed like all this is just hours and we're just going to use their resources and take every
how's it going on where you going you're just using the resources that are here and claiming it to be your own and it seems like well we got to wake up 5 we're having breakfast and we're going to who's going to get who's going to mow the lawn today
 and we're forgetting there already is an owner a possessor of a provider and we're just overlooking that was Squadron LG like that squatter squad or something like that taking over taking over squatters don't use the move into the homes of people that are there though that would be my no we're not there when we came back and we're seeing what happened with the jellyspotters don't even move into places that people are coming back but we can work with this party at someone's house like they're on vacation we're all going to go use their pool and something like that will happen same type of thing
an Orlando and being organized keep the place clean like we talked about the trying to create a party without inviting the proprietor okay with that I know I'm I agree with you wholeheartedly there but what I'm what I was really picking up was that you take the bug of agita now the bug of agita is a book it speaks a new Panasonic kind of tone right there's a lot in the back of a D2 that's going back to the Punisher this but that's hitting on the those messages of how no beginning without the body we are the spiritual Essence that gives life to the body that would be it spits teaching about the Detachment and tolerance and in in in different yoga principles like that about how to realize Brahman is there and Bug of agita and it and so on but at the very end
 it kind of turns its back on everything that's come before particulate evaders you know the four Vedas were saying sarva Dharma pricha
abandon all varieties of religion religious structure of abandon all those dharma's and go for the essence you know Just Surrender unto me just make that you know sacred loving connection with me to rebell against you know all of those other teachings and and that's what happens about what time is where you have the audacity who was this such a deeply realize sage and he's he's ridden all this literature
 that's aimed at people on different levels he's just trying to help them move one step up but he never but he's feeling all despondent and his Guru Nara to tell him the reason that you feel this pain is because you never really presented that essence you know you never really knew you were kind of presenting nice organized religion or you know through The Vedas or still even deeper concepts of detach
which is all interesting legit end in valuable but you're not satisfied until you rebelled against that and go the whole way to the Divine Essence what is where it's all good and so Bob with time itself is kind of presenting Rebels people that were bucking the system the religious is stalking The Vedic cuz it when Krishna himself as denouncing the brightest and saying you're just going to misled by Bishop flowers were tried video I'm so I'm up with the follow these rituals in the baddest and then you just come down again when your exhaust the pious activities you've done then you got to come down again it is it's you know I was thinking also in terms of Innocents in this Essence we read about vyas
 now we all have the highest respect for you I said this was the Great Sage The Great the mahamuni that was the greatest Sage who compiled all the way to the literature
he he was able to go into deep meditation have a vision you know of how to present this for the benefit of all living beings categorize it you know just like lengthy beautiful Sanskrit works with a talk with an estimate you can estimate what he offered in in all those texts so this was especially deeply empowered spiritual being
 his son is Shuka Dave goswami
 who speaks the Bible time and super Dave goswami he's not he doesn't do what Josh did he's actually like just a wild innocent Sage he doesn't even wear clothes and you know that the first Candlebox time is laying out so much it's laying out what we need to understand how special this text is this thing up the ass and his vision
 it's laying out the qualification
of the hearer mara cricket and it's also laying out the quality of the speaker Sugardale goswami you know it and involve times going to Taos like he's going to show us that that scene we're shooting table Swami it just sent his spiritual
 freedom in wildness he just walks away from home naked wandering into the forest just deeply absorbed in his in his spiritual awareness and and he walks past this Lake where they're young ladies that are bathing naked in the lake and they see him and they just stay as they are and then the office is following trying to catch up to his son yeah and and and when they see if yes I'd like to see the Avatar when I see him they cover themselves up and he says my son walked by
Eden cover yourselves have I walked by you cover ourselves up what flies that and he said we could just sense that he's entirely otherworldly so you know is it showing as his name but his nakedness is a is a it does symbolize innocence you know her and that innocence is is is a palpable to to these ladies they can just look at him and see this person has no loss has no greasy entirely other world has no material catcher that's the person ever going to hear Bob Tom from right and from that from that deep innocence a week at the the Deep spiritual Essence and so Bob times and be like no other texts even of all of yahtzees text it's worth yes it is going right to that spiritual Essence in this really important
 who anyway think we'll get into this more as we go with a shovel let's hear what what happens with your with Culloden and I'm just top up because
you're right. Even though I am the musketeer and all them witches are very means of Conquest when should I expect the base and sees to the Supreme Lord Narayan on to narineh Ryan resheet the super most human be at your mother saraswoti the goddess of learning and should be asked to leave the author not stop rage about race Unity come in by rendering service to the pier devotees all that is troublesome to the heart will become eradicated and loving service for the Supreme Lord who is praise the transcendental songs will be established as in a revocable fact
darkness of ignorance my teachers open in my eyes with a torch light of knowledge after Mill Basin sees that there Lotus feet 7 chapter 6 text 20
 again we have a lot of teaching to the teaching his friends in school
 Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme personality of godhead who is the cause of all causes the original source of everything okay so yesterday we're hearing about how he was speaking to their possible skepticism how do you connect with this device that is accessible to us yet he's accessible to you he's everywhere it's not like you can't find them easily accessible and he's also intimately related with every living being so on that level you have you can access him so he saying yeah you can you know you cannot
nothing is unobtainable when you when you approach him with devotion I have this realization to say while chanting japa I was just like like a waking up you know today I didn't wake up right and I just woke up due to the alarm and I was a little tired and was just like a leper G&A laziness and the first couple of rounds was Channing was just sort of like just like dealing with my own exhaustion can I sit in front of these beautiful pictures we have and and I was thinking you know what I kind of want Krishna Krishna to want me I got to want it cuz I don't want Krishna he's going to just say okay I'm going to back off to so today I have to want you Krishna and I'm chanting because I want you there has to be a Consciousness yes we do things on a regular basis regularly but
 there has to be can't just be
McHenry on route route route route rotate wrote it has to be alive if I have to want Christian in my life the chanting has to call Krishna into my life that did Christian say I do repetition right they can't have him pick some like that I don't we don't want we don't want being repetition we want sincere calling God nothing is going to table nothing is untenable the Lord is the reservoir
 of unlimited Sports qualities for devotees therefore tour Transit Dental to the Goon has the most immature of nature what is the use of following the principles of Dharma Arthur, right
 religion Economic Development sense gratification of Liberation right that beta said these are the worst steps stages of human life
the rebellious town here used to following these principles that everybody's laying down for us and this is and this is the normal
 civilized life of a life out there something higher it's it is very rebellious what's the use of going through these stages which are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the grown-ups the modes of nature we devotees always glorify the Lotus feet of the Lord and the Arab or we need to ask for any we need not think in terms of Dharma Arctic, mugshot right you don't have to ask your desires to be of a field or some good work in this world were above that all we want is you Vishnu want you to open that comment Ariana
 this is a really it's in what sense in progress how many commentaries but in what sense his message here so
. sure I thought you were to say something else in advanced civilization in an advanced civilization in this man we got a big enough now in an advanced civilization people are eager to be religious to be economically well-situated to satisfy their senses to the fullest extent
 and at last to attain Liberation and he's sitting this is an advanced civilization that they were sent to Dharma are too, Moksha it's it's civilized it's and not only is it seem like it's an advanced civilization all the pelagic said you don't need this
 however these are not to be magnified as desirable indeed for devotee
 what
indeed for devotie these are all very easily available they belong to talk or he was a great Saint said I dented the once-promising Dharma in order to the the ability to live a very
 Noble life look a right through that to receive all the gifts of this world to cultivating Good Karma you're getting wealth you're getting Health you're getting you no stability in so many ways through that all your desires are being fulfilled you getting too warm for the family and loved you getting all the different things that you want and then ultimately
 letting go of it all and becoming free bread letting go of it all and becoming free of the the
 the tensions in the pressures of this world
 probably just said that stuff is
for devotie now that's not that sounds like a really give a call to like hard-working self-disciplined life and not only that but it's like successful and it in requires the faith that by living this life all these good things come and then it actually happens and probably saying that is actually all for the for the one that goes to the essence all of that stuff which is an essential
 comes easy and now he's going to quote this like super deep to go to build Munger Taco the beautiful poet Brenda Robin in a fully absorbed in love of Krishna and this is it always an interesting I've ever said he can post usually says in English I'll save you my Sanskrit Liberation always stands at the door of a devoted to making this distinction between bhakti and Morty to hear Rancho mini 1 multi-piece let's call it peace you want peace it's already there if you got it
think about it I did all these are already going to get that sound like I cannot tainted yeah it's sitting there like my slaves at the door of a devotee ready to carry out his orders material advancement in Dharma Arctic, Moksha right religion Economic Development since gratification of Liberation simply wait to serve a devotee at the first opportunity
 a devotee is already in a Transit into position they don't need the E does not need further qualification to be liberated I thought that you had looked and of course Liberation is the big one here right out of the four simple analogy is
 and I use that example I was moving to New York City and all this drama Charlie's help moving into an apartment is very pain in the neck in New York cuz you got to park the truck which is hard to do so is that a sit in the truck so we can unload it so he's got to get the apartment door open it takes a team of people
to do it and not only is it exhausting but it's it's like
 do they got to pay the people to do it you got to pay them realizing you could get a ticket on your truck and all the devotees showed up in case they switch arjan roskam it was just sweet it may be boss today if I think we should home recent case they all came and helped them move and they did it smiling and singing they didn't want payments over the money out we don't pay me this is just save up and you think they're 44 in vodka do you want to serve the devotees but they were already in peace they weren't looking for multi they were already peaceful I was like listen it's getting late let me at least give you some money. Probably already ate everything is good they are just eager to start when you have the desire
I just want to serve
 nothing can upset you any longer yeah you've got everything that you want through Dharma, do you have no desire for that anymore it's kind of like it's already satisfied but the person who's getting paid to do it is their job to be like well I worked overtime and I threw my back or you know this is too much for me yeah they're like saying I'm doing the dorm I'm serving Now give me the AR test already got peace
 a devotee is already in a Transit at the position is not need further complications to be liberated as confirmed in the bhagavad-gita saguna summited Guyton but I'mma buy you a cup of tea a devotee is Transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three gunas
material nature write some of those really bad for you I do I feel like this is krishna's Mercy this is a chance for me to grow this is a learning opportunity and they're not even thinking like this is a bad day today they're way above that up there and touch it says they're on the Brahmin platform their their their platform of awareness is beyond the ups and downs and new changes of the material and 101st today you know something's going great today thank you Christina I'm going miserable thank you Krista you know it's a beautiful day I'm snowing it's snowing out thank-you Krishna I slipped on the ice hurt my ankle thank you Krista I think you've lost one of my shoes that wasn't a squirrel that was right on your points
 that sucks girl okay until you please
therefore in the beginning of the transit in the literature on Mirage Chuck conch satana
 if one is engaged in the trash out the Washing Service of the lotus feet of a lord he does not need anything in terms of Dharma Arctic, Moshe and she went back with Tom therefore in the beginning of The Treasure of the literature it is said Dharma project are unnecessary
 near Macedon persons were completely transcendental to the material activities of separateness who make no distinction between mine and yours could have simply engaging. Bhakti devotional service of the Lord are actually fit to accept bhagavat Dharma so that's the qualification qualification no more mine and yours
yes can I have yours
 because they are near much Sarah not jealous of anyone is with your world is envious of your hearing heart you're very successful envious
 I deserve that
 not jealous of anyone they want to make other devote they want to make others devotees even their enemies right so big whole world is just Petty and you got me know I'm going to overlook their bad qualities and I'm going to see them as devotees I'm just going to see them as Spiritual Beings and as I cry says you turn the other cheek right what do you do if someone slaps you in the other cheek to slap you know it's like not only were just going to love people that are lovely we're going to love the jerks of this world the people are mistreating me
that are cruel to us we're going to see something essential in them powerful stuff
 where are we will you just read because they're near much soda because there are limits to what they want to make other devotees even their enemies in this regards to the mud with Charlie remarks at a milkshake am happy to come The Conch subtle Utah devotees are non desirous of any material happiness including the happiness derived from Liberation this is called on you be like she does sooniyam Jana, do not return carmie's write the person who desire is material happiness and Gianni's who desire Liberation but the body does not desire anything
 simply Satisfied by rendering Transit at the 11:00 service at the Lotus feet of the Lord glorifying him everywhere by preaching which is his life and soul
this commentary is shrill appropriate extending something it's like it's going back to Sri chaitanya you know like over 500 years ago who did something you could call it Revolution that you can call it a rebellious and what we're talking about and that is that he took the shipment Bob's home and said look at this book and see how it turns everything that even all this Pious righteous dharmic tradition that we have that's all it's helpful is healthy in a sense but to get to the essence you almost have to turn it upside down you all you have to do in a sense rebell against it or at least you can say let go of it and that is very bold but how can you make that statement how can you are you criticizing The Works of biasa Dave how does that all work it out by the time
 like in the popular you
the circles and all that like in the in the west everyone knows about bug of agita everyone knows about yoga sutras you know if you're in some yoga teacher training course it's likely those books will come up right not so many people that although by the time is like an Indian's is all over, Tom yeah those three braids works at kind of inform their entire culture and its importance is you know is is widespread but it's with the full understanding of his message is not so deeply understood Prop Hunt and shoot a ton of shine the light on that his followers you no further expand on that and she'll pop right now is extending this to the English speaking or the entire Western World or you can say the entire Globe that's in what sense that's our that's our
makes a dog sound like that now one example of how it turns things upside down we're speaking about this last night
 if you go to the vet there's one there's a story that's told throughout biasa days works in different places in in different ways you can read it about in The Vedas you can read about it I don't know if it's if it's in upanishads but it maybe it's in the Mahabharata it's in different piranhas that it's in the oldest what they consider the oldest book of the base I think Aaron is it but it's not only their my point is that it's coming again and again right and then ultimately told at the conclusion in the papa tom where is a great yes so so if y'all save course in the Bob time is trying to give us the highest understand it if it's a story of Richard sure that this demon that fights with Indra the king of Heaven if you go to The Vedas when you hear about injera
 Andrew's always the highly respected
being this great aerobic being and an invoice to buy what I'm always fumbling around all you know is what time you think like he's a demon are always a fool he's so how did it get turned upside down when you read about Richard Sora and injure in The Vedas
 Andrew's a total hero British or is nothing but of banged vicious horrible demon by the time you get to Shuman Bob with time Richard Sora is the hero know why is he the hero is that even though he's a demon
 he's a devoted and so even though he was born in a demoniac lineage even though he was given activities to do that were in that there were count to to the Davis
you are kind of like the official representatives of Lord Vishnu he had a deeper Devotion to learn much more than injured had an injury was in that fight for his own selfish purposes although it was kind of in the guise of supporting Lauren Bushnell that really it had to do with maintaining his own position within the material world where is Richard Sorrell had no such attachments he he was I'm ready to die here because I my heart is completely devoted to Lord Vishnu I want to reconnect him so you got a completely turned it it's it's saying you know what yes and rude does represent righteousness in goodness and so on but that we need to let go if we need to stop seeing that as a highest thing is he pure devotion even if it's in a demon it must be glorified in an interest position must be minimized same story different vantage point exactly exactly
of the Schumann bar with time and a great verse that's the one about
 getting rid of all scriptures that it said that that are into cheap meaning you want some of your protein god with desire. Arma projected to vote here in in this book you read The Vedas you rather punish as you've read all these different piranhas and so on but in this book hearing religiosity covered by selfish motives were going to reject that this lower stage were going to rebell against it the Dharma may be good for you if you're a dharmik but if you want to give the greatest essence of all of those we're going to kick all that we should remember this
 you want to quote a verse or two cuz of her completely reject motivated this
4 lb the highest truth which is understand understand why those who are fully pure at heart that's real important you this beautiful bag what time the highest the highest truth truth is reality reality distinguish from illusion for the welfare of all
 such such such truth search truth what is it up route up route to three-fold misery this beautiful Bob and Tom compiled by the Great Sage biasa Dave and his maturity
 is sufficient is sufficient itself for God realization what is the use of any other scriptures and what is indeed what is it needed any other scripture as soon as one
 attentively attentively and submissive submissively here's a message of the bog of a Time
 by this culture by this cultural knowledge one establishes a supreme Lord is established in the in in the heart I wasn't play a game with you
yeah you need to see this versus let's do that that's the homework for the class read 112 which is first first can't do first chapter second verse read that three times it's a beautiful verse no K and N S S S this so much important formation shared here to give us to give us the proper perspective we're entering into a new League of of shastra a new League of of sacred texts in the Vatican within the beta can't even from the same author biasa Dave he's letting us to know everybody this is of a different quality what I'm providing work any of the lower religious teachings that I was sharing before we're kicking it all out either one of us is going to work
 this is going to work this whole class today while you're talkin that there's a background
going how's it going to work how's it going to click because like you were saying early earlier it's like we have to agree on something even the same this guy was saying well know everything's made up and then you said what about human trafficking in the wall that's bad what what it what is the community that a collectively agree upon is the absolute truth
 and how do we do that
 it seems like everyone's got to agree on something or else they're going to be like
 good flick site there a lot of good Christians out there but a lot of them don't agree with vegetarians have a lot of conservative principles and the family and protecting the children and all these things like we could rally behind but when it comes to killing animals are like that's not a big deal at all how does it how do we actually all get on the same page and follow you know one hand and of literature do I don't know
never quite entirely happens but obviously the thing takes very powerful leadership and when I mean powerful I mean that which inspires others so if there are strong for medical people that can illustrate the drawbacks of this yeah then people can be in front of things can you actually turn around quickly but let's not let's not that's my friend that was not what I was working on a point in her it was definitely a conversation but let me just continue to develop this point okay so this verse so much as being sure one point is being shared is that he's identified that biasa saying all of my other books I've been giving you messages that that don't go to the essence they're helpful their steps forward but in this text it in what sense they offer a promise like if you want to get someone to do something good for them self and they're not the most intelligent
 then you make a promise that this is going to make you
when you do this and that's what Josh is doing in the baby's even a new punished as we going to say Liberation is going to make you happy but actually it doesn't deliver complete satisfaction sure so in one sense is a false promise and now he's saying all that cheating is being kicked out now now we're going to get to you we're not going to share with you what gives you and it's just a few verses down the road where he's using the term I'm a super City complete satisfaction itself that this is going to come about in the Bog of time and he's going to say this near much of them sit down and figure this is understandable by who who is it's being spoken to The Bob & Tom
 sugar David speaking at tomorrow Mark Berry Bob's those who are near much are entirely pure at heart. This is really important because the other texts are not necessarily ended that person there there in two people with attachments their end of people
that are that are being heavily influenced by the lowermost material nature so a different level of teaching is being given to them but this bar with time this is being spoke for two other pure and hard before we can give the deepest most essential truth and therefore he says what is in need of any other scripture if if you the essence of it is all going to be found here in the box is not you don't need to go back to Dharma Arctic almond milk sure you don't need to go back to these religious rituals and all the if you understand that the root of all existence is this beautiful Shri Krishna and the essence of all life is to have a loving reconnection all of that is standing at your door waiting with with Tom's fault that you don't need to go there you can just focus on the essential truth you know now is you have used it a long time ago and the show but I just say it again it's an LG have used as liberation
 and the problems with Liberate the downfalls of Liberation so there's one
when my kids were small and just a household was tough being in the house was exhausting and the kids were needy and my spouse was needy and we didn't have that much money and I got offered like this great yoga Festival in Jakarta good money doing tons of workshops and as I write this is a good opportunity so I flew to Jakarta and get a little tour of Southeast Asia teaching yoga and
 they're like in this is a food coupon you can get whatever you want everything is vegetarian and the festival is happening at a waterpark so here you are in Indonesia at a waterpark and and I was like I allowed I like water parks it's like really hot out are we allowed to use like the water park but yeah whatever
you have a whole day to use the water park I didn't know anybody and so all that there was like nope crybabies there was no duties I had to do I teach a couple classes and basically I'm at a water park with all I can eat and you know I actually like water parks up to go there with my kids go there or go when I was younger brother with my my good friends but when you're in a waterpark alone
 it's like awkward it's like it's like you're waiting to get on the ride or do you want to go on with these three little kids pictures of Beanie Baby take your photo like I'm on the wall somebody's house that they pay for that photo
 so yeah it's awkward so my point is you have no more pain you eat whatever you want there's no there's no duties to do you're actually free but there's a loneliness
also with Liberation but when there's actually service there's always like a joy the living entity desires relationship and that's boss that's that was Proposition answer when he was asked about what Baba Tom says about multi and again this is where you going to get the full information about the false promise that you'll get from New punishes are you going to be fully Satisfied by multi-stripe for it that's just to get you to continue to move in the right direction of evolution
 but it but the promise of the complete satisfaction that you're going to find in in
 and the pain shots through multi gets clarified in Baltimore says what you get and monkeys like a drop compared to the ocean that's about it and it also says
 that this feeling of monkey is actually
 unreal and they fall back
down the end in another state and you achieve the state of long lasting deep peace but eventually you come back into the material realm of ups and downs and in two properties that's why why does it happen why would someone leave that circumstances of total peace and because I get lonely to get lonely and you know I wanted to be friendly to those kids that's weird I'm friendly then if I don't look at the kids and I'm weird for not letting you know what no one wants to be on a water slide alone no I don't want to be anywhere the time right now
