 hello. Hello.
today by
 live from Goa this is wisdom of the sages a daily other podcast with your host rocking out in Cohoes senior Advocate at the Barclays Center in New York but who is live at in Maya poor stupid ass welcome to everybody Welcome to our daily study the shoe mud bog the time to try to keep a daily as best we can
 good to see you cuz you have a really good day today I tried to reach you all day you were not returning my WhatsApp messages sorry I'm sorry I was busy I was busy I had some great conversations with some great Soul some great people to I was
I when I bathed in the ganga did you and I had a really wonderful time in the ganga just chanting japa
 really and I was I was feeling
 just wonderful and blessed to be there
 and I when I got out Teva was sitting there on the bank of the ganga ji would you like Carly that's one of her favorite spots and we'd spoken you know I tell you something about the work that she's doing
 the second day in a row where I bougie bougie appreciation day yeah well it's just you know it's time to speak of her my heart she is in one sense relatively new to bhakti
 but she's very well experienced in the 12 steps and the spiritual path that that is
 well not only that you can't say that to her she'll blow her top she'll be like
well because you know she doesn't need anyone coming into the body Community the brought about the community she's relatively new to it but right off the bat she's got really important Services going into some of the darkest corners of it
 you know I am down and I think helping in Waze
 that others can't
 and I really admire her for taking on that service me to it's really something if you haven't checked out the people talk to your recovery podcast please download it and follow the mail to be a
 an instrument of healing and places
deep wounds
 is is a really special offer and she's doing that I can see that
 for sure for sure I should that she cuts through all the superficial right away and I think that's what the hell 12-step program is it's it's it's okay to be dented it gives permission to be a little dented in a broken not in that is all her ability
 that's there for sure but I'm also thinking sometimes when you've been scarred then you bear deep resentments although those are deep resentment in One sensors a justification and then you hold on to that tighten your building identity around that and it actually was preventing you from healing and to be able to step in there and work with someone on that level and get to the deepest levels of honesty and and Progressive thought that is a great service and I don't think too many people are Adept at it you do the 12 steps
Fall Creek dedicated to that program there's they have a depth of understanding and of character and the first time I came into contact with it which is about 25 years ago I started to a dinner and reading some of the books I realized like wow this could be so useful in bhakti and at the same time he can be so useful in their Community as well they go perfectly hand-in-hand
 yeah you know like she was explained to me how with some people who were even born into the about to pass but then they had their
 they're what's wrong with you you know they are sometimes they've been abused
 other types of tragedies
 and dramas a reach a point where
 they have to
start from scratch even if they're born into this and live with it they it kind of whatever they've been to McLeod the way that they say even this purepet path of bhakti right is pure spiritual path is the way that they viewed as seen through this lens of trauma and so on and they have to kind of go back and say is this even my face
 and then if they do when they come back on the say yes this is my face now there now they can actually
 approach it with an open heart you know without without the that lens kind of a lens of resentment a lens of pain so many things
 and you have to if you're going to progressing is that you have to you have to embrace it with faith you don't face in so many principles and ideas
 you don't want to talk to do that wholeheartedly you got it that you have
approaching fresh again and to take someone through that path that's really something you know there was a person I'm friends with and who's been active in recovery for a long time he stepped away from recovery because he started he started finding fault with recovery he starts saying you know the problem is with so much Dogma in these meetings and there's so much you know the same things that go on with any institution almost but then in the process of stepping away from per year as he realized you know what with all his problems I missed its community and that's another thing whenever there is an organization or a group of people coming together to get caught up in the same things you get caught up in the Dogma you got caught up in superficial if you get caught up in the presentation you got too caught up in the outward appearance and an inward maybe some type of duplicity that's going on and so but if you say you know what I'm sick of these devotees sure I'm sick of this community and you step away from it
it's hard to do things on your own communities are powerful for so they're hatched there always will be a tension between the problems with an institution of problems with our local community to problems with their will be that tension because on our own we are like we struggle with like a twig we're easily breakable and I've been through times in my own life to where I'm like I'm a fall and then I've been times you like I want nothing to do with these hairy Krishna people and I'm going to ReDiscover my identity separate than that and then I just get to them back yeah yes yes because whatever is because everybody wants you because we are communities seeking people we like people we we we get we get lonely and then you're going to clean by the new community
I think it's not only that I just need a community but it said this community's onto something even if they don't do it perfectly they're really onto something and I benefit from that yeah and it's true though you do have to hand select the people you want close to you right now you have to eat ham select them that you can't have the gate wide open because you know what it's like any other community anybody could walk in that circle around a bunch of people in the mall you're going to buy me some crazy people interesting people a handful of crazy people you're going to find a criminal escaped or something whatever that's just part of any group of numbers game that's the numbers game that's the numbers game and they're out there man creeps are out there
 okay creature out there Mary that's our first
and there's Greek I mean I've met the coolest people ever hanging out in the temple just because a type of people that attracted to go to American Harry Krishna Temple would you like an expression when we joined but they're like falling apart and broken and like no infrastructure the type of people that show up there you're going to get the coolest people in the world and you're going to get the craziest people in the world and we I said you know you you said I didn't respond to your text today and then I said I was busy talking with people and one was Giovanni and then later I spent hours with vasudevam who's the no real Brahmin from the bucket center-right a real pundit he's currently he's been super 6 years Holland yeah
 and on but he lives in New York City per maybe past 13 years is so steady person at the bhakti center stack is good and you're deeply romantic what he's been working on
a translation to cut open a shot for 6 years and you know taking it very seriously and you know the translation and a commentary on it and I've been I've been having some brutally I just been like I think I mentioned on the show earlier I haven't been writing these past couple weeks but I've been researching and studying have you been yes I have and I haven't just been hanging out on the beach and saying I'm writing a book that pizza place in Maya Pour at the model Cafe there at the model Cafe 7 grade 4 hours and all that I've been studying and you know I've been studying in discovering new things have been excited about it and deepening my understanding a certain areas and he was a person without just could step right into it
and just run with it and add to it and you know he's a walking you know like he's like a walking shastra himself you know and and it was wonderful son wonderful Association tube to hear his thoughts and in clarify my own Thoughts by you know sharing together I love that kind of stuff and and that's what you get in a community like this right yeah you going to get some crazy and then you got some real jewels and even the people that you can't really was so well maybe someone else were laced with them really well and that's great let that you know our second bind their own from me and now you to hang out
 but we do have good people in our life I say that on a regular basis do I mirror we have good people in our life but I will say that
okay we can make a tree out of the people in our lives when we check in with mirror here.
 Speaking of all this back to recovery stuff we have locked your cover
 at 1 and 9:30 p.m. eastern time
 Saturday
 shout out to wisdom the sage is going to Italy if you want to join us we are going 7318 it's a shout-out to Italy in my Italian itself to the people of Italy love those people yeah anyway looking forward to stages.com
 okay let's get into some good today the Nugget is one of my favorites
yours you might have heard of him his name is Jesus from Tijuana Jesus Jesus Jesus Christ Superstar I know you go there how could I not where in the Bible from Jesus Christ Superstar all about my love for you only said that just to put it out of the test to see if you go there and you went right there will you know what not to like a magnet Jesus Christ back to I tell people all the time you want to learn about the Bible Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell that's all you need to know okay at least the New Testament
 I hear the Nugget from this is from Matthew Matthew is 144 to be exact thank you by the way the Matthew is Matthew Mark and Luke who actually hung with Jesus we have some big Jesus followers on the shelter 3
apostles
 yeah but some of them never met Jesus my friend some of the some of the books in some of them or just Paul Matthew Mark and Luke Matthew Mark and Luke met Jesus know all the poor guy that fortune is a different unit on her mind right now she's a big Jesus fan but put on the best about John John never met Jesus
 John he says John like John 3:16 he never met Jesus
 anyway she sits at the other end of the table
 okay listen I'm going to read this nugget
I'll never met Jesus yes but he's not one of the 12 apostles know that he wrote the book some of the books in the New Testament that are not Point that's my point is Matthew Mark and Luke they're the ones that actually brought the books in the New Testament about John
 time that Jesus
 he's on the train
 but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those
 who persecute you there's a big one that's in a big one right there this is the one that really caught me this is the one that really dragged my heart into Jesus is what makes me a Jesus follower
 love your enemies and cuz it's right it's so anti what you want are you saying that a certain point in your life you read this verse and you felt some calling to GF yeah
I was in like 19
 okay so you're in your liking the hard when I was my Christian club and I was in a Christian Club in Hiram College in particular that got you going to forgive those the one that the one how many times should you forgive 7 times no 70 times that one
 be good especially the exorcism quotes
 we're not going there but I can say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be the sons of your father who is in heaven
 for he makes his he makes his sun rise on the evil
 and on the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust
I like this it's like it's God's in charge of the karma we say yamaraja is but it's at if you don't have to be in charge of someone else's, right all you have to do is you have to manage your heart right and so it's very easy to go on an autopilot up of you done you've done a I hate a I hate you but we're having what we're doing here is where moving sort of like with the punch we're moving in or not punch him back for not forcing our Force against there for us we're moving with it moving with the wind not getting blown by the wind and so we're getting attacked we're not attacking back we're starting to learn and not only that we're seeing God's hand in those so-called enemies those people were coming against us and realizing like oh I get it this is for me this
is for me to challenge my ego and my ego is what has been keeping me imprisoned in this world no people are keeping me in prison no one could put me in prison that's just an external to some external world you want to throw me in solitary confinement there is no jail or that can hold me down the only Jailer is my own mind and heart if I can conquer my mind and heart you could do anything with me you know that's great.
 And you know I'm looking at something just occurred to me
 that you know when they say you know Jesus is the son of God
 you there I'm just thinking deeply I was thinking about that too but but here he's saying that we all can be sons of the father right
only one who thinks this is where you're going to go with this LOL I want to go somewhere else for the but that's what I liked about it was you know that we talked about some couple weeks ago we talked about the principle of ahimsa and we said that there's this benediction comes in one fully lives out
 did the niyama over himself and that has been a good weekend is that within your Arena you know that no harm can be done others don't do harm to two others and so I kind of radiate a certain
 cone of Peace live the same life have thoughts you think okay and so so here he's saying that if you want to be a son of your father
 it's not just claiming that I did
claiming Elite it's not to claiming allegiance to like I accept Jesus therefore on the son of the father know he's saying your your heart has to change and how you respond to other people has to evolve for you to be understood connected in that way and it is so like you're not one that when we spoke about that dumb that cone of Peace we said that
 that I gave an example of how I saw how rotten I saw me who I believe deeply in bodies that how someone who was like being aggressive towards me they had to withdraw that in his presence
 right it's because they identified themselves as his follower
 and so in order to be his follower they had to live as he lives she respond to others as he responds to Jesus saying that kind of thing here too if if you
the son of your father for Real Son of God for real then you have to love your enemies because he loves them so you have to align your heart with his heart and you have to love them as well even if they are quote on quote your enemies you can't show up to the great vison of us and start complaining about other violation of us they don't want they don't want to hear it they're not great souls are not there to commiserate with you against another vaishnava their Maids acting as their their their their to sort of you step back from it and see how you can react to the situation how you can see God's hand in what's happening not the same yeah you've been wronged I'm going to tell that guy off I'm glad you told me this little piece of dirt now I'm going to do justice to this person and insert Jesus when he speaking as he's not just saying do it because it's right or do it because you can go to hell if you don't
 he said if you want to be
sons of your father if you want to be aligned with him aligned in your heart with him not just Allegiance spoken Allegiance
 but aligned and heart then you have to have a heart like his and he shines his son on the evil and the good he sends rain on the just and the unjust you have to do the same
 you know you know what I'm going to I'm going to a Christian again I'm gonna well that I am a Christian I am a Christian. I'm going to give a shout out to ramaswamy it is there a book called life with a perfect master who wrote that I believe border jumper broke up with the perfect. Or maybe that's true Mirage Road in Masters I think that was wrong, anyway
 I'm going to take that title
read a book called Rhino Swami I feel like everything he so teaches You & I by example because we see him go through different things and different people come up to him and dumped stuff on him and I just watch the way here and I go to him with issues and things and excitement and I just watched the way he deals with and I was just like okay less than their less if it's amazing how you can instruct with sank so little powerful like that and we need we need to get great buy shrubs in our life and we need to find out how to serve them at least to be serious about just like you started this whole conversation with Geva she really isn't this an important one we really need to figure out what our contribution in bacta is because that contributions could have your heart and soul it's going to be the reason why we wake up in the morning
will keep us going when times are tough we need to feel like what our contribution is and we end it will give us the mercy of the great souls and that's how we make a pass when we get the blessing of the devotees

 he became spiritually jubilant and remain silent his hair stay
hang on end in tears quieting down from his half-closed eyes because of his love for the Lord okay so we're hearing about a lot little boy a lot little more like to see that he's experiencing because of his association with perfect unalloyed devotees who had nothing to do with anything material prolonged Mirage constantly engage in the service of the Lord's Lotus feet with some icing Icing is bodily features when he was in perfect ecstasy persons very poor and spiritual understanding became purified
 in other words prolonged Mirage bestowed upon them Transit at the Bliss interesting whatever you see affects your Consciousness you see a great Soul that's going to be a great Soul they say that we read this prayer to you the the yamuna yamuna Davie right you know I'm talking about as soon as
thinking about you Luna Debbie purifies one so thinking about great Souls sing a picture of one seen with someone in person singing just hearing sometimes people listen to lectures or tapes about the devotees chanting or kirtan by great Souls that affects her mind in the same way you know what what is hanging in our house with pictures that are hanging on her house guess what we're taking all that in they say that sinful people
 sing their face creates it on your Consciousness what you think about bats do I turn my camera off when I Feel clean when I see her whenever I see your smiling face okay so anyway yeah you got to be careful what you're looking at on a regular basis I had a baby picture of sweet baby Jesus on my walk with curly hair that was one of the pictures hanging in my house I see that everyday
Play Walk by that on my way to my bedroom and I stayed at impression last in my face of sweet baby Jesus nice did I ever tell you about the poster that was having this is a squirrel maybe I shouldn't do it
 yeah tell me what is an interesting squirrel I have a postulate 44 which is whenever cuz scuba has a squirrel let him say that you mentioned the post something to picture that you hadn't in your in your bedroom
 is that right now if no I didn't put in Jesus pictures in my bedroom but I did have a little ways in the house to the house he had a poster

and the class I have the class I had a I had a class Sex Pistols and a x-ray Spex poster my room which class one was it
 it was a lot of some live life and have it be all the different flags of the world behind them I can't remember but I know the sex might have been the same post another wise saying poster so I was
 in the golden Eco Village
 three little kids were talking to interviewing this for me after talk that he gave
 and one of them had a unicorn t-shirt on
 okay
 it was on your dumbbell preacher started a little lovely little girl she loves unicorns too
how old is that time like maybe she was little
 and I want to tell you a secret about unicorns they actually they really exist but only very good devotees can see them and then she just she came turned around and came running at me jumping in there like you said they're true they exist call Dad
 something did you know that the legend of the Unicorn or some like that I said no more Choice hat and he said well it's sad that the Unicorn is just like this was some Legend from somewhere he told me what it was but I do remember they said it said like the Unicorn second most powerful animal because got all the power of the horse but then it's
I like this Spike coming out of its head you know so it's like it's powerful and dangerous you know it's like a very powerful creature was like a rhinoceros dish yeah but faster and you know and
 he said what he said that there's only one type of person that can tame the Unicorn small child has small innocent girl of the girl
 Teamster the spirit of the Unicorn such a powerful Spirit write such a raging power is probably how you could tell who's a virgin yes just put the unicorn from the heart and
Krishna that dad sent me on a second scroll I can't do people want to hear the bog of a time I was going to drag you back here I'm looking at here's the point of a squirrel's tail is there Kylie Brown Linda Linda Linda is they're all saying go for dummies bro I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it I'll stick with one scroll here's the point he said because of that he used to have a poster of you as a teenager he had a poster of the unicorn in his bedroom and he said I used to meditate
 on the Innocence
 of that girl that could tame the spirit of the unicorn and try to understand he was one of those nice people before he was like most teenagers have Jimmy Page up on this Black Sabbath to make be nice and I'm still working
I'm still not as nice as I'd like to be as I'd like to be my children are much nicer than I am I was and that that was Rana story before he discovered Krishna conscious that's where his mind was at as a teenager like trying to understand. I don't understand Dennis's meditating on it okay that's my appreciate that
 yeah yes it was you who has 42 if I would have went with a double scroller I don't know you're not allowed to not in your repertoire double squirrels Nation after the show you can squirrel me all you like okay just people need you maybe at the end I'll do that squirrel when we're doing the cut and people most people don't get to hear it but if you stay on the zoom you get to hear are ranting forever because of his association with the perfect man the best one was when my mom came on and she just went to 45 for an hour
our longer because of his association with perfect unalloyed we just read this
 text 43 my dear my dear King Easter text Jerry the demon hiranyakashipu tormented this exalted fortunate devotee although prologue was his own son Marjorie de Sousa said the same some of the demigods or best of spiritual leaders how did hiranyakashipu you so much trouble to provide Mirage the pure and exalted same problem with his own son I wish to know about this subject from you a father and a mother always affectionate to their children when the children are disobedient the parents chastise them not to die Amity but only for the child's instruction and Welfare how did heretic ashepoo the father plug for La Mirage by such a noble son that is what I'm eager to know
 Margie just your further inquired
is it possible for a father to be so violent towards an exalted son who was obedient well-behaved and respectful to his father O'Brien oh Master I've never heard of such a contradiction as an affectionate father is punishing his Noble son with the intention of Killing Him kindly dissipator thought there are doubts in this regard dysfunctional family some of us have like issues with our parents are the parents of the issue
 no not well I'm saying some of us have issues with our parents but I mean who they are and have the issue well yes I'm saying anybody have a parent like her any cause you poo is trying to kill him or saying here's the parent they had the issue by prolonged Mirage the st. Louis
Veronica shih-poo text one I'll tell you something about this chapter that we're going to tell me they're going to be for questions asked to provide in this chapter
 they're going to come from both hernia cause she poo
 his father and they're going to come from his teachers what are they under a new marker what is it son. No marking on Sunday in America yeah and each time he gets asked a question
 he comes through
 it's kind of like speaking truth to power but without any attitude you know he's going to answer in ways that are beyond the wisdom of children
 Jerry Lee and they're very the answers are both
 waiting pregnant in spiritual truth of their pregnant yeah and they are
kind of bomb what's the word I'm looking for like right not rebellious but speaking in a way that will that's
 is contrary to the to the authorities in his life he speaking truth to Authority sure is speaking truth to power
 so there's four times and it has we hit those questions I'll Point them out in and then each time we can see what he says and each time it's really good and it all relates to his friends and enemy idea kind of thinking Mooney said sonar data is having a conversation with this fear is arjuna's older brother in there in that writing the story the demons had to buy her any cashew Pooh accepted sukra charya as the priests of ritualistic Ceremonies to Super Charlie has the Google
of the Demons Mara trivia question who is the guru of the demigods
 there is good right now that picked that out of the park nearest like put me on the hot seat I'm ready like there was a day where you said Hunker on the hot seat anymore
 nice chica tries to Sons I didn't know that either lived near hiranyakashipu Palace was already educated in bhakti devotional life but when his father sent him to those two sons of aw educated they accepted him at their school along with the other sons of the Demons
 thesaurus provide certainly heard and recited the topics of politics and economics.
the teachers but he understood that political philosophy involves considering some ends and someone else and enemy and us he did not like it cuz you supposed to say that Riker steba is all that nowadays it's like pick a side and now hate somebody and you know what it's like and now because we get our news through YouTube algorithms and Instagram and Facebook algorithm it's always like this YouTube video right someone so completely demolishes so and so and then and then they really don't but I don't know what you think you know that was the kind of person I want someone to go down hard it's like we are begging to be to stay in the material world aren't we
 that is the beautiful thing about you know what this is great thing about Krishna Consciousness is
we want to be entertained want you want to Rally behind something really behind Krishna there's great lectures on YouTube at our fingertips that are entertaining that are funny that are you know that are good stories you know that's why it's important than that are uplifting uplifting where you're not learning how to hate otherwise he's political things you just learned to hate and this is what product provide Mirage said before America was even a country
 right yeah it's a I think you froze out just a second when you're reading a but it would like to be this kind of sad but he understood that political philosophy involves considering someone a friend and someone else banana me and that she did not like you want to read the commentary to this
 yeah
 this is this room text 3
 what the heck
yeah we just got Frozen
 should I reach I start yeah I'll get them from his country's politics involves accepting one group of men as enemies and another group of friends everything in politics is based on this philosophy and the entire world especially a present is engrossed in. I mean more than ever were engrossed in the public is concerned with friendly countries in front of groups or enemy countries and enemy groups are but as I stated what I stated in bug of agita a learned person does not make distinctions between enemies and friends devotees especially
 dune buggy always especially do not create friends and enemies that every living being is part
 now here's a
it's not just sentimental but it has to do with seeing the truth right so here's the truth a devotee sees that every living being is part and parcel of Christian my my vong showed you a puta there for a devotee treats friends and enemies equally by trying to educate them both in Krishna consciousness of course atheistic men do not follow the instructions of pure devotees but instead consider devotee their enemy voting however never creates a situation of friendship and enmity they don't create a situation of friendship and enmity although prolonged Mirage was obliged to hear the instructions of Sunda and a marker he did not like the philosophy friends and enemies
 which forms the basis of politics he was not interested in this philosophy so he's being trained to be a political leader in this school
 and he's from an early age they're trying to instill in him
a vision of we have our allies and we have our enemies and he can't relate to it you know this is kind of like the beginning of a loser it like a loser begins with identify with my body that's like the first solution in at least directly to the second illusion which means I begin to see in terms of friends and enemies these are my people yeah yeah and so this thing in here you know it's again it's it's not like it's just some sentimental thing but it has to do with you know we're talkin yesterday up Brahmin realisation par Mama realization baghban realization what is Brahman realization means I realized I see other people make other people see that's my enemy
 but the Brahmin realize person is like I see it on perceiving it I'm feeling it for real that there's an inherent spiritual equality
 on the level of the Soul there's a there's an inherent Oneness
and all life and knowing myself
 means knowing that there's a principle of the terminology of God inside me
 and that same principle is what every other living being is made of and so therefore the false identities of friends and enemies I I can't see in that way the Brahmin realize person that's Pearl I even though he's just a little boy he's receive the blessings of Naruto it has been revealed yet but that in the womb of his mother visited when he was in the room of his mother's not visited and spoke to his mother really to speak to him in the womb and he was imbibing this deep spiritual realization
 like I said I never text for my dear King you to steer Once Upon a Time the king of
demons for Ani Kashi Pooh took his son prologue on his lap brief actually acquired my dear son please let me know what you think is the best of all subjects you have studied from your teachers write to Father hasn't seen this is Tasha number one but his son on his lap a little hug sniff his head tell me son what have you learned in school what's the best thing what's your favorite subject you're still as response is he going to say math is he going to say I like kickball and dodgeball is going to say politics is he going to say you know what I just like Jim
 so young it really doesn't matter at this point right he's just a little boy just a little boy
 I think this answer the best of the asuras king of the Demons
 yeah that looks or was that a compliment yeah I think so either that was the dinosaurs or erase I guess
yeah and he was what is this ship a lot of Russia
 he called him a sort of Aria
 you know that the leader of the of the varya that has he a source the best of the asuras as far as I have learned for my spiritual Master any person was accepted everybody and a temporary household life is certainly embarrassed by anxiety because having fun in a dark well where there is no water but only suffer so a lot of times you don't think of them in the last we talked about what we think of it like a European well it's going to Stone Circle record in India they have these just open pit Wells and and then they dry up and they walk away from them and they get covered in grass and the people trip and they fall in a well
 wiener wiener person I knew a guy who fell in a well
who's the podiatrist walking around and he fell in a well they broke his legs
 so happens it's a thing and so they're using this and analogy of those were grossed in material life is like falling in a well you can't get out and no one's around they can't hear you
 and how nice it would for a lot of saying to his father
 indirectly but kind of directly he saying you like my dear father you are you with your big Palace and all of your opulence has and your your whole materialistic life you don't realize it but you're being you're always in anxiety because of this your deep down in a dark well in your stuck and there's a way out and I'm going to tell you the way out and this is what he says you continue
