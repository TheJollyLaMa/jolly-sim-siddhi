Understanding Data as an asset class | FIL Brussels 2024

the bees get excited free throw show some energy and I love to take it over to the person who wrote the book on the data economy and data as an asset mr. Michael Clarke
 thank you very much. My voice I lost it like 2 days ago so this is pretty good thank you very much okay so Michael
 Kyla Kane
 oh okay okay so the word I said it came up and on my work for years ago
 as we had to call and I said but a single fact is this is get this out of the way early and nobody understands dates and no one appreciates it if you saw it from that premise you're in a really good place. Explain why that is a true statement
so you understand all the statement to make because we seem to be progressing nicely right if we look at the world today growing digital payments new forms of assets even Marketplace into props exist price for life feels really good if I look forward to the future and most of Commerce all these new experiences powered by WEAR 3 all these Technologies are taking us to a place that we feel better right itself has been on a journey which I don't think many people realize
 we all made of data
 why do some people sometimes forget the day turn up audio is about 13.6 billion years old on the hydrogen in our bodies as old as the universe so we already walking library of dates and that's how we started off we saw a drawing on walls of the cave paintings they were form of identity they were from a relationship fast forward to hieroglyphics fast forward to the Rosetta Stone these were all the time
nations of language and we'll building in research at the foundation of computing it with the foundation of a i in the foundation of virtual reality as we know it was a big difference a day to become a byproduct of a transaction
 nothing storage was created and I wouldn't mind list or just crazy but people were just storing stuff they didn't understand the value of what it was just a necessary device to actually capture takes her how to get a 1950s someone wrote into the new Statesman mid-1960s actually I forgot the date but they call me was what are we going to do with all this day to recreate it was the right and wrong question it could have asked where is the value in all this day to be creating will be on the right track
 then suddenly take to become a commodity as part of the internet in The Mobile Generation from will building to research to commodity so now what dates are is being traded behind the scene of the incident became the action based economy on top of
then they too became everything there's no connected to everything that we do every single thing that powers your mobile phone bring this into perspective
 we create 1.7 mag every second hold of you were doing that right now on your mobile phones so he threw his here the day he rightly debunked the IDC numbers they are cheap. 74 thousands AB that's just bring this into the real world for you you know if I lived and if everybody in the world live to be 90 years of age which we hope everybody does. Kind of gets you the number if you want to bring that time another level that's what I number means really it's 65 million football stadiums worth of dates with about 70,000 people in each one
 that's how much days we will create
 which is incredible right here is something produced by the idea by SoMo which is released every year it gives you a sense of how much states is created every minute
the number to say that we've created 90% of the world's lost a 22 24 years I'm sorry to tell you 80% of the internet is to placated
 I so happy with the wrestling
 the technology is progressing all YouTube dangerous to cleaning
 what is reflected in some of the statistics of thirty billion dollars is the value of a new software globally
 most companies have arrived about 367 systems on average on this stuff spend around two-thirds of a week or so today we trying to find a tear in the first place
 68% of data is used by businesses not used but stores prices are going up and costs so we kind of do this tension a 97% of all health teacher is not used
 Yes dear I'm in 2024 on Northeast single person of the view of that Health in one place
 I don't think of that trust is actually declining
 so these are some of the things that you may not know
is that 16% of UK people call and find a balance on a prank statement at school
 let me see the scary when we now have the attention span of 8 seconds the Goldfish has 9
 sorry I'm also interesting in the last two years of cyberattacks will because of human error
 and Industry businesses cuz we just don't know how to read dates are anymore because we got too much of it I mean, I can understand it and I'm not coming back to then trust so 54% of Americans have absolutely no idea what a company does it take to let us hope that you caught 76% people think sharing their dates was a necessary evil and doing my book I interviewed the students and they said to me look if we don't give up our dates that we won't be able to connect with our friends on communities and connect so it's a necessary evil to give update
what is dates are as well it's actually a cultural artifact if you think about it for teen million people a year ago and visit the pyramids in Egypt why cuz they want to know stories and memories of the past
 cuz that's actually what dates are is it's a story it's a Memory his experience it's on modern day culture like that that's what it's become sad if you don't respect it so between 1991 and 1995 the internet would never archived
 the early days of the internet not much of it still exists that's one fact
 the other factors platforms failed regularly but they took vanishes with the platform just disappears so y'all who is an example geosits he just probably the worst case we're 12 years of age with completed I don't talk like that
 why am i showing the New York Library in the background because if you add up all the dates that was deleted between 2009 and 2018 that's the equivalent of me standing in front of the New York Library
delete button when deleting the whole building
 that's how much about culture is being deleted in the last 10-15 years during covid approach archives struggled to piece together the history of covid-19 being recycled I misunderstood
 yeah I realize we've been here before
 it's what this we could think about looking through history cuz you see parallels which other people do not
 it's weird I'm going to talk about water
 so in the early days of water they was industrial pollution and he was also a water scarcity
 that was also addressed by the fact that we have technology at our disposal we started to see early water treatment plants and we saw a broader capabilities about managing and distribution of water
 it is also a policy breaches water right conflicts violations of Regulation
 and then on top of that
when they was a case for NASA because there was health risks and it was unfair Equitable east of water because you aren't going with us right so maybe knows your history Standard Oil dominated the oil industry to Big Monopoly broken up which is why you see all the oil companies that exist today because they came from that moment
 oops sorry
 you said no
 the officer's name Africa
 seriously going to do this year
 okay fine I'll talk to you on screen as well so if you look here in these breeches and international trade oil disputes not as like a taste
dates of monopolies and consolidation of power which is equivalent of unregulated banking
 cloud computing web3 all of these Technologies and now it might dispose off we've never had before in my lifetime I have athex failures I have data privacy and I have pictures on the cause for an asset is antitrust and Tech concerns so actually the environment is right it seems like a perfect storm that is recreating the bases underlying environment causes the crated all the other outfits and by the way the same for all of them
 is this a gas is a hold of them they all had a combination of events over a. Of time which is time makes sense for it to happen
 if we want to move forward with Humanity that means we need a new Mission we need a whole new and I are two recent data which is this Mission which is putting the dates are in the service is all Humanity giving everyone the human rights to own created under
on the day to that makes them who they are
 was I giving them the choice to share who they choose to share it with the rewards they get and having the transparency and control
 that means you need a new vision
 which ultimately says we will transform data into an actual asset that is priced and valued and I don't mean value financially I need valued as in appreciated as a National Asset that's managed by a nation I might as well as people which means that means people aren't educated how to use it critical thinking the ability to bait the ability to reason that they took the old so that we can get the price Theatre
 this is what happens when they to become an asset it's not a digital representation if he comes the foundations of a nation and its people
 and then technology enables that which is why they would date as an asset is so powerful because it's the only thing that's similar to water which is nicer the big difference is what makes States was an asset so powerful is it infinite
the result is a finite that's the big difference even we look at money what is money is the instrument of death dates are is not
 so it starts open up a different mindset because it's become an asset to take the ownership full so has to become a little
 Brazil is the first country in the world that I know of is going to make it lower that its citizens can monetize the room brighter
 that low and I was out for consultation which means other countries around the world will follow and ownership will become a thing so you never cleared the first building block but they do to become an asset because it must be owned by someone so now he told me to do it now has the underlying principles to be an ass at the other thing is I need to be able to rethink value to Value an asset in the first place because it is the biggest problem is dead so I don't want a bunk fortunate that you were calling me for the dates our economy is actually a rush because it's value is the value of the market cap of the companies in the days were going to meet up the value of the day
floating through the economy because why because they tear at 10:20 is very different to 10:21 or 1:21 cuz I'm adding to it over time so as a basket of day to recoup be worth ten times as much but it's also everything and nothing at exactly the same time if I put it in one environment is worth billions of dollars that same day to another environment is completely worthless so you have to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic value of data is means we need to rethink the value itself May, said I said because intrinsic value means what was it mean to me my cultural heritage of that dates a how old is it its uniqueness does a business I have a whole other set of intrinsic values responded to me then it was the extrinsic value when it take to get to Value to the outside world when people can see her so when she valued her phone is shut up you're on the journey cuz I'm going to be nicer
 which is what we doing all the indefinite
 movie Vice
this is where is different so we've seen countries around the world and companies try to reward people for sharing our data that's not good enough because we know that's not a one-off event if I show you my date to the company that probably going to use that defeated II model on this continual value that I know Cassidy has a date sirona so we need to include continual streams of value because that's what they too will bring the underlying basis for NASA
 different products will come off the back of the couch I can give you the book which is financial dates are assets sewed a Tracker to find a track which he stated that they treat yes they just savings products will become the basis of this
 hey I will become modular as a consequence today AI is too big
 too many promises not enough they say eventually for to run on the edge we will need modular AI
means AI running on my own diverse data in real time
 so that means I'll have health at 11 so I will have to work on my data for specific demands of Interest running locally
 knowing who I am because who I was yesterday is not who I am today
 part of the issue where they are
 in China they produced these down to about six billion parameters I know people were building on 220 million which means that in three years time they will be marketplaces Valentine's but you will download locate your device running on you with Alexa
 so these are the use cases that you can start to see emerging as they tear itself becomes the opposite of choice
 I told about this on the coindesk of the day which was in a full trust me with some of the use cases are around eight years and I sat next Generation scenario planning is the oldest one I can take all my dates from Billy perspective
I'm so today is my day to rudinos my Amazon life my
 Herbalife am I am his whole body feeling history right what if I could build onto single this back to the right of my device
 my Korea pockets and fragmentation and build a perspective of my career older that is actually possible if you focus on the date threw itself and connect it today we have about 100 passes between us because we allowed a just be fragmented from Identity which is a real power of web 3 because then all of a sudden I typed that complete the magic Triton try which is a true identity and Dolly once I connect the three I now get connect to take to it which means as even more valuable to pick Tech than they think because now they have more days to never seen before in my life
 the reason I show this is scenario planning because in the next for the next two years and with my people not like Unity to make this possible will create digital twins off around 8 so maybe testing a person
from their children with their children technology that might seem like make-believe but why not BMW entire Factory all over the world by digital twins like on a man is my own health dates of the same way with Israeli goes his I inherit all my data to my children
 and they run it on their own device with AI to learn things about me maybe I was born with diabetes and they got diabetes they want us doing all the things I tried and then they can apply to themselves with the day I to try new things may be 10 years later
 members 2024 we have walked the most powerful computers in my pocket but we still do have a single view of a house
 which is what we cannot have because we have the capability to do it
 I drew this picture about 6 years ago
 yeah I think it is 6 years old now
 and it still holds true to this day is the date of the heart
everything that we do what we have to do
 one thing I'll ask him to take away is
 do not think of this to the transaction cuz it never was and it never was a number this thing build wills and gave us language and everything we do everyday is a store and experience let me give you a true story crime this like with a plane from London to Dubai there's a lady opposite me and she wanted to talk to me is like them these things on the plane but she was sitting weirdly and she said I saw you talkin to like sacks or like why you lying like that and she said hi back cancer
 and I was stage 4 I broke my back in the gym and they found it and then she killed herself after like a year and they didn't know how I asked about what you do just remember the people keep asking me what I did so I can help them and I said what will it be cool if you have a awesome day too I mean could go back 100 years now we share value for value
write imagine I will cancel she's got cancer I'm following the medical advice she sounds proposing a different model and we share data between us
 and I run a on it
 that's what it really comes down to I met a woman who told me a story that you can share that with anyone
 that states a stock is a form of information that the right from date so that's why this stuff is so powerful and what you're doing because when it becomes an actual ass that I don't mean a technical why would it means it has the regulation wraps around to it is financially recognize all of those things by default you get transparency by default you get all the things that we don't get today can you give everybody a chance in the world to share this story cuz I guarantee you one thing there's somebody on this planet to contacts as a computer it was dates that we've never seen before in her life if they could share it they could hold a disease we just don't know.
if you look at this diagram what you'll see is that you will become the way you got 10 to $5 it'll be the way we prove things I would also be the way that we build relationships it would also be a store of value says it's the next one I agree with him actually if the two of them had a baby Bitcoin ethereum you get tighter cuz they just posted them it's a store of value out of utility this programmable okay
 on top of that ugly tell this utility is the way we view ourselves but also his well-being we already saw tour dates retali medicine during covid-19 people do crate and real versions of take that which is fine to the Pacific use case but also be a mirror how do you say to solve problems on myself may beat us there was an asset class that will shape not just this generation for the generations that follow the goal is very
people I would like a child to be born into dates or annoy I
 cuz if a phone is a date so that means I use it publicly that might not it means we'll remove the word artificial intelligence will. Conversation I will start talkin about collaborative intelligence
 which is actually human and machine working in Partnership running on their diverse day two with children that can actually critically think candidates and can actually use and reason on August 8th to literacy
 that's the vision
 because we need power them to lead with 8 to go today is buried in databases and various transactions we don't know what to do with it I'll storage is rising computers getting more more expensive energy demands a higher yet we haven't got a clue what to do with it if you make it an ass that it becomes part of the curriculum but it also becomes part of everyday life
 Iowa
play this by speaking of potato is actually potential its potential to innovate its potential to solve problems is the potential to make a change
 Computing and Technology Justin tables at and allows it to flow which is why we can have this conversation today because all the amazing with you guys have done to make that possible my job is to open the doors so technology can come in and I still have time doing
 I want thing I realized in writing the book is this is a really important statement
 is my icon change the rules of the game
 but I can make de Zapatos the game
 which means if I make it an asset by definition it's part of the game I didn't change any rules
 the cool thing is all the rules that govern the game now it's like today to which means everybody wins
 if I leave you with this
 all of you in this room and keep Luke
be here a little key to making this reality
 the first time in probably a lifetime we can have this conversation this room because we don't have the means we have all the technology we will have a need with a hold of human capability that we left in the eat now we just need the will to make it possible
 which is my asking everyone in the room especially make this real
 I present a talk about a book cuz if I know he mentioned it so it broke out next year the book actually is in a fight Parts as important to a further five the first part is a voice for the Gen X generation to the mountain change this is a factory a story of day to that you probably not hear it I given you snap it's the second part of the book is a guidebook for those that must change so I'm actually going to show you how to make a dator nastor legally how to operate it with a framework that you guys can build against don't give you the technology but I'll give you the building blocks in the functions
now it will works and even how you value dates for itself and I'll give you all the use cases that you might want to think about across Finance house longevity communities and so on and a possible future an eight-point plan for every government in the world I'm looking to governments globally to make it an asset possible so hold of you to make this a reality. Thank you very much
 are you guys have questions
 do questions come on come on
 so yes the part of the model
the first thing is I have to meet them where they are
 so to me Technologies like the first thing is I have to make them understand it's possible to make it and I sent so I should regulate tri-level I don't know when the ship level then you can go down into the enablement Poff because I have to go into the layers with them first of all I have to make it clear to Michael written to the UK government this morning and the new signs I had a sentence Science and Technology because you're hitting them first of all if I think Portishead it is the wire first I got the country trust is the worst it's ever beaten when it comes to technology so we're offering you a way out to say look at you recognize this is an ass hat full movie of the nation you can get me 7 Things by Design I want him in the room with them
 which is the goal then I can reveal the motor itself as they look you have to have tokenization effect that you have to have a small contract you have some blockchain and you have to have some Vehicles wax liquidizer
like a bank balance like a portfolio of your valuable data
 Crucible I have to create an environment that makes that possible so I was involved in the UK myopenbank he was first created so I will I have to find quite distracted you how they would compete the first thing is you have to create an environment so people can come in
 so that's my first priority but yes absolutely there are an able is what I talked about in the book wish you were right he describes on how that model actually works on we are the functions but before I get there I stayed well who owns the outside what is the asset to where can I use the I said how do I find leave it and then I got the hard way up right to it which is what you were describing when is another layer again beneath that which says well how do I appreciate the outside
 I think I'm going to have to talk about education and you have to talk about cultural management of the I set which is all things I have to write to buy
Define because my system of the government I have to reach them there because of body fat that is once it becomes an ass that you saw the transparency issues with a high
 because now it's Google becomes a critical service provider like any other utility in the wolf
 if I make you a NASA so if you saw this and you'll get to where you are when they start talking about enablement and that's also why I'll probably go to countries with your ordeal not do any Justin easiest salary it's not always the problem because you'll go to some countries and go like you don't need the model just apply these regulate three principles and build from there cuz I can go to Stony I would you like a mess of Block Chain country already have some of the interest rate chart we might just need to change regulation so it really depends but I always try and start with the Y first and give them the outcomes the next level that is exactly what you said in the book
yes
 so I go in the book agents that do that cuz you also need to rape date so to your point of different dates of I need to know what dates were operating to use in what conditions after what purpose so it is a would-be I guess they took him somewhere I want to use it to make a decision of the governmental level or something critical I'm probably going to want a highly rated states that I can trace the source so you need something like that and then you going to need to be able to validate that they took make sure it's real along with the right thing that I need something to clean it and verify it and get rid of Life Soul.
agents things are built into the book is modules as well as other services in plugins that you need to cleanse the environment basically you'll see business is a marriage that do this but they won't be run by people will be run by AI agents probably and something over seeing them that actually make sure the rules applied by governments and you another part of looking off to the economy will actually mine is that I never see it that's why you do this one piece of the time that's why you start with the regulation and get people to buy into it and then be the messenger for it you can then tackle out of the time but it's not it's probably about 1 year to change a lower end of a decade to change your mindset
 goal is to get these things done incrementally so we can open the Georgia Technologies to make this easier and it becomes possible
 this is a pain I miss even harder when you're a big but I got to work with big corporations all the time I'm at bank last week 75 years with it take that right
do you know what the value is sweetheart that's what we talked about incrementally one use case is a time when intend to the time break time of the day to Silo but it will come when we talk about stuff in the book of Acts
 I love that video.
 LA Clippers
 do I need to wear
 you look amazing
 okay now I'm home and dad is on Facebook
 another centralized
 my uncle tomorrow what is the
I got the lowest hanging fruit is your personal data that's the easy stuff right that's like that 10:11 take the twins to defined you as a login that's the easy one and then you would then lose whenever you sign up for service at sizing a date if I wouldn't get fixated on that it's certainly part of it the question is how can you turn your dates French utility for yourself
 yeah because if you think of a meditation that's why ownership has failed to constantly because whenever they go to big tax is nothing no longer to change their mind because if I go back to UConn change the rules to the game and if you go after them with money he will say to you while no you can't have it was if you say when actually I'll send it to your service and I'm having this date to this mind anything related to the I might choose so that LinkedIn would be a good example you set for think then you login you took my zone information and you choose that and the different types of information is a generation on the
and that you would like to keep those ends off while back sister to do what you want that allows you to build your perspective on day two and who knows you could build a perspective and then you could stop what people could even invest in you as far as what they say the personal data is the easiest place to start for regulator cuz it's already defined as well stand it but the starting point before it gets to you cuz to be frank Howard Hughes dated today isn't up to us
 is defined by enablers who then to tell me what a business can and cannot do
 so that's why I have to go there so then whatever you want to actually become possible
 I'm in the low-hanging fruit becomes the use cases that we will come up with
 do I have to start at do we all agree the people should only take the yes ok Google do we have a digital identity that correlates between Daytona and I did yes okay good that's all that and then it becomes an asset by definition and there are building blocks then
Define amass. So I can be financially Majid all that stuff that makes a compliant then have to be done how's that happening you could easily see start of trying new things in different spaces once an acid becomes an asset if he liked open Dragon King new companies with a marriage with a difference is open banking is those companies that would have to think about Avaya lyrics change for you to want to share with them
 like if you don't think about me making me have magic Crystal.
 But also you the one dates I want information
 right cuz they trying to sound completely with us it's only when it's chilly
probably doesn't mean something so unique capabilities on your Superbowl let's be able to do that for you to translate your internet cuz you're sharing information with people I don't need to know them all cousin ever. I need the dates of something will turn into inside information for me so you need a translation layer which is why I have to put in the book which is I need a layer which captures Rotator someone stole it for me not to centralize body in a decentralized network and then basically someone says okay I'm going to do something with it I will not turn it into value and then move it
 soft rice in there, you gave me is just the base level if you part of the pyramid stage of the wisdom not just the base level of no meaning just a raw data table I'm going to turn into something and then I'm going to shoot intense and I'm going to move it like a limit order on the stock market that's what I'm going to do
 all right
stuff for Michael
