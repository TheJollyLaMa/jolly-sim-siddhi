OpenAI Assistants API â€“ Course for Beginners


welcome to this conference of course on Open the Eyes assistance API allows developers to build powerful AI assistants capable of performing a variety of tasks this course covers is sensitive topics like in a grain of API for advanced functionality is leveraging its knowledge retrieval and code interpretation capabilities and understanding the fundamentals of large language model through Hands-On projects with streamlet and real-world examples of skills to build responsive applications to transform your smartphone platforms hello and welcome to this course my name is Pollo de Chao I am a software engineer so I teach people how to become a software engineer as developers build applications and I've told so taught over 250,000 students in various skills from programming relapses AI as well as Cloud engineering so welcome to this
next question is what is it illegal to be learning into squares and it's going to be learning about the assistance API going to learn about function of calls and going to learn about people making museums and of course they'll be building a lot of stuff I'm going through this course because that is how I like to introduce certain Concepts to my students so that's part of the body to be expecting in this course and of course I'll be talking about large live with models and bearings and all these things that relates to a I specifically okay now let's talk about the prerequisites for this course so I expect you to at least have the basics of programming courses I expect to be an expert or anything, as long as you have some fundamentals of programming Viet Java Script or any other modern is programming language you should be fine going out to discourse and one thing to keep in mind is that in fortunately this is not a 101 programming course I'm not going to teach you out
rather old focus on the big picture idea of recipient and Marge language models so we going to be using Python and its course I'll be if you was never used. I found you don't even know where python is that okay that's not the main thing here main thing is that I want you to understand how this technology how assistance API and how large do with models how AI based applications built that is the main goal here so don't worry you'll be fine as long as you want to learn and you follow along what are going to be doing it the other thing also remember that you have access to all of that code in the description below okay now let's go ahead and look into python setup and especially the environment setup so that you can follow along with his course and I'll keep in mind if you already have python setup on a machine and you have Visual Studio code or any other code editor that you use obviously don't have to follow along because this is you have all that right so if you don't have that thing
I show you right now what you need to do what I need to install a new machine that way you're able to follow along in this course not the best place that found online where you are able to go through tutorials on how to set up a python specifically on your machine whether it's Windows Mac Linux and so forth is this link here at which I'm going to show you right now let's go and take a look right so if you go to this link here which is kingston.com Alex Bay's install python this does everything that you will ever need or at least has all of the instructions you need to install python if you don't have python installed on your machine okay so just go ahead and follow exactly what they have here they even tell you what is python which is kind of nice and all the things that you need to cancel just follow along and we're thing is that you can go through this different links here so how do you spell python the windows if you want Windows click here that will take you to the setup and how do you spell python and a MicroSD that will take you through this
set up that you need to go through and of course if you're very special and autonomics go ahead and click here and just follow the instructions so it's really straightforward I don't see any value in me going through all of this with you so go ahead and get that set up if you don't have python setup on your machine and we'll go from there. So the next thing we will need is an ID and integrated development environment I use Visual Studio code which is what I'm going to be using in this or so if you have something else that you use that's totally fine go with back but go ahead and download that if you don't have it so it's very simple can go to visual studio code
 and depending on your machine for me I'm a Mac it just goes straight to download Mac universal and click here and you can see that we have mac or somewhere so we know we next in all this guy so depending on the situation just go ahead and download the version
the latest version of PS code and it should be ready to go because of the nature of what we going to be learning in this course which is openai assistants abiud bullet needs to have an open a.i. account but it's not important for obvious reasons and so particularly what do you need to do is you need to go ahead and create in this case have an API key because that's what will allow us to use the assistant API in first thing you can do with openai apis and so forth so bad he's very important to show you real quick here so if you type in open the i.com are you see here make this Liberty larger you'll be able to say login so click here if you don't have an open my account so you can go ahead and say sign up if you already have one can just put your email and go ahead and sign in all so we can go ahead and say continue with Google with Microsoft account or with Apple so I already have an account
you can go ahead and sign up okay so I'm going to say come to me with Google I think you could also go that route to create an account and gives you this opportunity to hear to choose between going to check your booty or going to a p i want to go to API and this is what's going to open so this will take us to this main few here so there's a lot of things lot of capabilities get started and all that but do we really want to go to Ace to go to assistant API which actually was going to do that later but what we want right now is to go to a Tik Tok Ki KI which I created a little bit ago so go ahead and see create an API key and you can name this
 Isis
 API that kike name whatever you want and that API key click there to create this API key and then we'll need to do is copy this API Key by clicking here and save this guy key for later
discourse once we get started coding into all this thing so it's very important to not to share this with anyone in fact after I've created this and wanted to wait this so that way you can't use that okay so save it in a very safe place that way you don't lose it make sure that once you close that window just like I said he there is no other way for you to access it to get it again so that was that's why I wanted you to save it okay but you can create as many secret tease as you need so if you for some reason didn't copy that you can go ahead and create a new one and go from there so that should be it about setting up your API environment understanding what we going to be doing this course as well as having your API Keys set up or created for us to be able to use that in this course
 okay so now let's go ahead and look at what is this thing called assistance API the assistant API is a tool built by the opening II
that allows developers to easily craft and build AI based application that leverage the opening it environment the opening II platform for sale thing to understand about the assistant API is that it's not its own entity per say although it is but it is attached or extends the OPI API which includes all of the tools and models that power tragedy and many other underlying infrastructure of the open a.i. environment so that is important distinction here is that when you talk about the stands what already is there lead in this case the open a.i. API intern makes it easier for us to build AI Tools in this case AI assistants that we can use in our application actually allows this gives us this platform this framework is libraries quickly uses tools to build any application a high-paced application that we would want to build
that happened to know too much about the underlining abstraction of how things actually work so essential can go ahead and create an assistant and the use the API so that we can connect my assistant in our application and use that assistant that has the ability of connecting with the opening i a p i c t s CPI what is the problem that it's soft now the thing to understand is that building applications in general let alone building an AI based of Vacations by it's a very hard task for developers b super complex. There are at the usual eat a lot of moving parts that are Developer needs to focus on developers need to manage this case circling for structures they need to keep in mind how to data is being used Which models are needed to use in this case to power their applications to have to learn how to craft the best promised possible or to communicate with his large language models
I also need to understand or keep track of the application State understand about embeddings which is something totally different but his part of this realm of a i and largely with models and understanding the storage mechanism right how do we upload files how does the large one with model use those files to allow us to tap into the main Arledge but also those files retrieval those files knowledge but also retrieve information from those filed and so many things right so this is not easy it's a very complex to carry as a developer this poses a problem for developers give now developers instead of focusing on building the actual application now they're focusing on how to stitch all these pieces together to make this work for the benefit of using the assistant API is that is that all of this complexity all of these things that developers needed to know or two.
it's abstract it out which means I don't have to deal with it no more because now the assistant API in the back end of everything is taken care of all we need to do last developers now is to focus on what matter which is billed all the location to the assistance happy I already has all the things that we need a developer that we don't need to think about them because it abstracts out all of that work so one thing to keep in mind is that we talked about a large language models for the day by themself they don't have a state which means they don't save a context of the conversation for sake now with you we don't have the problem because there was this thing called a persistent threading for ongoing conversation what is means is now we're able to save messages and the context of that messages that way let's see if you're creating a bot you don't have to yourself save that context so that the end when you ask a certain question that the butt
know about the previous conversation we bought will actually know what he referring to because it has a context think that's huge without we don't have to worry about that the assistant API has that built in a nose we have the retrieval mechanisms for digging through data so what this means is that we can upload files for the models to use for additional knowledge base so you can upload files about something let's say about cryptocurrency so now that piece of knowledge is added to the main base knowledge base model that way you can come first with the large language model in addition to the knowledge that we just added by uploading certain files documents and so bored so now we have a more flexible and more knowledgeable if I miss a lot of slime with model because we are aiding it with retrieval mechanisms he also has cold and actually writes can analyze code and also the thing
which is amazing as one of the biggest things that we now get with assistant API is that we can actually do function calling what that means is that one of our assistant is solving the problem we asked a question this is new be able to call a function that we specify that will be used as a tool to go and fax them they detect that Delores language model needs to solve a certain problem and that is cute cuz now in addition to uploading files for retrieve old mechanisms and so forth we can also add more tools by adding these functions and go serve as agents I can go and do something else and bring back the results we should going to be used by the large language model is to open the I hope you have a say or write to solve the problem or to answer accurately what you are asking for that's pretty awesome mind-blowing let me show you the diagram here real quick so we can see visually the assistance API benefits
if you look at this diagram here right the assistants can go ahead and call the open-air models like to tune their personalities case if there are capabilities also these assistants can also access multiple Tools in parallel so now it's sort of having these agents at that can go and do stuff and bring back the results so that we can help the assistant to be a better assistant write these are tools the tools that we have here talk about the court and coat in her I have good knowledge with three-fold right files and documents we can pass upload so that our systems has more knowledgeable about certain topic as well function calling that the great thing about a functional calling is that we can create it's a way for us to create our own tools on top of the tools that the assistant already has access to such as The Interpreter knowledge or approval and so forth so now with days we can create our own tools
writing our own functions that go for instant and fetch the current situation in Bulgaria or go and fetch go and fetch some sort of data in the database somewhere you can and along with everything that I say that we have this persistent threats to the threads will talk about in a second here allows us to have these messages that we are saving or already saved you know conversation it's so those are saved for context which is huge because remember all large language model they don't have a concept of saving history per se so they were stateless I don't have a way of saving the context which is problematic when we want to refer to a certain class and there was talked about if they do not dare not saving that history then it wouldn't know why you referring to so context is very important that is all day even with the assistance Avi and of course
about the benefits of the assistant API the most liked of course you've heard of the chat completion API which is the one that you've been using if you were using the openai API right to just send messages and you received the response has been useful because the completion API it goes straight to the open area models and ask questions and the large one with models and of course to knowledge-based thing here is that this knowledge base is now his base that is already there there's no addition meaning if you would ask certain questions about something that was done or happened after September 20th after September 2023 I believe write anything that was that after that then the large this large language model here wouldn't have that knowledge base just say I don't know because the completion if yeah I just a way for us to get the direct response because that is the difference here between the chat completion of the alley which is useful with the assistant API I have
earlier okay so let's look at this General comparison by so I can see the difference is between the assistant to have some sort of an idea we can see here the aspect column and yes it's b b i e h at completion API so for assistant API initial setup you have to create an assistant with Define capabilities which will see you in a little bit for Chad completion of course there's there's nothing for you to set up you just call the API and get the results the answers and so forth for the assistance if you I would have to initiate and manage in this case it's rad for ongoing conversation will talk about what a threat is and all that stuff in a little bit and afford to eat a completion of course we have none of that this is just to show you the differences between the assistance API and the trash completions if you can go down here to complexity so the more complex a type of course for this is API and it seemed blur of course for the Chatham completions if you have no need to memorize
this this is just something you can take a screenshot of and then go ahead and you don't just take a look at to see the differences between the SE stand CBI and the chat completions API and there you have it right so we just finished looking at the benefits of the assistance of the I say and how it works and how it facilitates our lives as available so that we can focus on actual building those AI based tools I can set of worrying about the underlining a structured things that we would have to do if we didn't have assistance so now let's look at the assistant API building blocks because we talked a lot about the underlining infrastructure how it works to benefits let's go ahead and look inside and see what are the building blocks of an assistant so here is a diagram I like having diagrams cuz I hopefully helps you go centralized these ideas the assistant API has about four main building blocks so first you see that we can
have this case an assistant to the assistant itself is in this case The Entity the thing for say that we have to build which will then the use to help us get information about certain Topic in this case you could have an example of an assistant who is a travel agent bought that we can use somebody's the first component in this second component of second building block is water cold threads for thread is where all of the messages that occur between their system and the user cuz I stay whole idea all these messages are tracked here in the thread that users might have a message and say hey what is the cost for an extra day in Paris which this system will have access to as well as to use it and then Dee would be the cost is $12,890 for taxes but then you will ask OK Google
message but how does the assistant know well the whole process has to go through the other piece here the other building block which is the Run entity mean entity it needs to have a few things for it to be able to run those who ask questions especially evaluate what's going on so there is this dialogue percent is happening in this case here through Vonage can see here we have I have to have access to the assistant in this case you will see later it's just going to be 90 and also has to be at have access or has to have a reference to the thread. That's where all the messages are so does he see this is going to be our travel agent.
 And if red is a trip to Paris for Christmas and then inside of this run the Run can be triggered through them run different steps to get to that conclusion of to get to the result what would happen is
if you look at all of this would have in this case the assistant to number 1 building block we have thread that is the number to building block he's a thread that's what have the message so good messages or message that's the number 3 building block a number four is the actual run and today
 how would all of this work well we have two seasons and inside of the season to have and then we'll have the thread we have a message from the user what is the cost for the extra day in Paris that is going to be sent to run which will have the assistant ID as well as the thread ID for the nurse know where to pull those messages that are coming in from pride and then he's going to go through the process steps number one used to go to interpreter if that's what needed to calculate things and then he's going to go ahead and create a message and if need be this has to be going to be able to go and call any other tool that may be
needed in order to get to the correct response and the response going to be as a message was going to be returned back again to I want to spread this make sense to the thread is where all the action really is being dumped into the history per say right now the thread will have the assistance message because all the steps are done we have the response and goes back as the message I sent this message and we can use that to show in a replication these are the assistant API building Lots very important here because it can be a little tricky at first you will eat whatever I say. The assistant itself needs Fred Fred that's where all the messages go just think of a bucket of messages and then enter to run here this is where the running of things to go and fetch things to go to the stamps this is where it happened the one needs to have reference
do the assistance business know who is this assistant with my assistant will have all of the specification that he needs so it knows what it specializes in in this case is a travel agent. So the one needs to have a piece in this case in reference to these assistant so when it goes and starts running the steps and knows what knowledge basic needs as well as other tools to indeed created message back so the assistance messages are all here so that we can then use those messages to show in our applications right so very simple but can be complex to wrap your head around understanding was there flies in these building blocks then what's coming next to Sun going to be too complicated to watch this card if you need to but I think it should be good so I will do next is we're going to go in the dashboard in the playground and look at creating an assistant manager
later I'm going to do that using Code so that lets go and logging into the opening II dashboard so we should have an account and everything that when you login this is more less or are you going to be seeing so what do you want to have it over here if you want to see that so it's like here this is over and we're going to go to assistance but this is where I went to go to Quick Care and sometimes takes some time it looks like I'm correct let's go ahead and refresh this
 so today would be having some issues but just refreshed if you're having some issues so once you hear let's go ahead and create our first assistant so we can go ahead and say create here or from here doesn't matter and first thing we need to do is add a name so let's say this is going to be
 personal trainer I such in then we need to pass or
the instructions so because his insistence me to say okay u r x y and z your knowledgeable in this area and so forth I have instructions here so much of the paste it in here and we're put here to make it a little bit larger so this says you are the best personal trainer and nutritionist who knows how to get clients to build muscle your train high-caliber athletes and movie stars with because that is exactly what we are all or striving to be so these are the instructions of course you will want to put as many structions as a prompt really how's you need for your assistance so if you specify exactly what you want your assistance to help you with in the back and the next we going to choose the model cracked open area model that we going to be using there are few and as a recording of this video would have to keep a chief for preview and horse these numbers will change depending on when
you going to be watching this video I just imagined just remember that the concept of how this work that's what really matters instead of the things that may change here so I'm just going to go ahead and use the 3.5 turbo that should be fine for now and is Liberty cheaper as well so when are you are one with more you're more than welcome to go to the higher so I just use that one and then we have the tools we talked about the pool so they allow was to attach certain things I think we want this assistance to be able to do if he doesn't already have those tools right so we have here retrieval we have decoded interpreter and we can add functions as well so we don't need anything I'm just going to go ahead and toggle decode interpreter just because they have anything else going to sleep my face and now the assistant was created and if I get rid of this and get rid of that
we do have our personal trainer so there is Dean instructions and the ID so this is very important because remember the diagram was trying to earlier was that when things were running will have that fourth component of building block which is run it needs to know that this personal trainer or a disc is the assistant so this is 98 Old to use a tunnel later we going to be able to generate or create assistance using Code which I'm going to show you but I just want to give you an overview right now so very bored and these ladies are going to be used and from here we can see you can go and sight test so you could hear this will open a different tab as you see here and then you can test it out to see if this actually works pretty since you can enter a message remember this is the message this kid will be the user message if I show you exactly there's assistant API building blocks this is what we've set up so we have the assistant
which in this case we said his travel agent bought but in this case without a trainer personal trainer and a thread which would have been created yet hasn't been created that will create all of this going to be created in the back end was be so running things and then we have the messages which is now we use our message is exactly what we passed here okay so say I want to build muscles
 what foods should I eat
 a b a run run what you think is going to supposed to do well what's going to happen that when we run first of all that message the moment we say run message will be added to read and you can see it even says a thread here for the thread right now is empty if I say run it's going to go ahead and add that message and think structions is showing here and there's a lot of things that's happening here so let me go ahead and
go through everything in there just make this probably can't make a smaller that's okay and one thing you see here this is the thread and each thread that is created because it is indeed a single message right for each trait that is created
 has also an ID this will make sense later so you can see here we have all the information so the threat is where all the messages are going to be in from this account user questions asked as well as wouldn't run and come back we should have the personal trainer to message as well just like what I showed you hear this run went ahead and pulled in the assistant ID internally and then the thread ID internally and then went through the steps and spit out the assistance message which now we can see here is the message Mike this is the assistant says personal trainer that's the name of her sister
muscles lean muscles that is it's important to focus on balance diet that includes protein-rich foods are grains fruits and vegetables healthy fats dairy products and all this great stuff and even gives us a little recognition here and know that it's important to consult with Healthcare professional and a great sign
 paracord this is what happening right so sexually goes back to what I showed you earlier going back here against also see that we have logs but this is really cool because that allows us to look at exactly what happened so you can see here we can hide logs we don't run hydraluxe right now cuz I want to show you something so far along is here look at what happened the moment we said run what happens that a friend was created indeed good we need the thread where all the messages are going to be in just like again hahaha where she'll get here okay
open here can see exactly what happened so the thread was created and it we have a response which is indeed the thread ID and Andy's ID here is exactly the same as they ask for an ID there was created you have other some other meditated that's okay and then we added message to Beth read the message was the one who wrote here in fact you can see all that happens here on this Randy usually it is what's being shown here as a log but I want you to understand this so you know where things are in case I what things are working you understand where to find things okay so we have our add message hear the message was added the role is user because I am a user in this case cuz I entered the message here right so when back it is this message here which is going to be sent to run
 so that happened
 I'm go ahead and close this
 message and then we run in the threat
write a post request has to have the assistant ID why did I tell you because if you look at this diagram hear Forster said assistant the name Ali has to have actual idea as well as the thread which is exactly what's happening in the back and if I close this thread here I would see you see that has the response and respond to each response has important objects is run and when was created to assistant ID as well as the thread ID while I and all of these are the record data as well as the model that was used the instructions all of that was sent along in the response and then of course the status because when we hit run when he run what happened to the back end of the things are happening meaning these steps are going to go to see maybe he has to use a CO
message into all these other things it's not until all the steps all done which means an answer a message in this case in Hattiesburg from our run assistant in this case until then once that is done that the message is actually created and sent back so all of that is happening here right this is the log and the Run step let's see what happens first object here this day. If I open the state of here and keep opening your past dady the object like this are the steps right back. That's exactly there's the status and this is the steps going through the whole process of creating crafting this message for this message was going to be sent in and we can see the results
 continue so we can see he has a Json he responds he comes in as a list and I'll check list and we have data field
has an ID object occur at step a run step when was created and all the great stuff and continue the other step
 and I've been steps as possible and then status run status to tell us whether the running is over everything is set up now we have a response and resolution can be passed back to the assistance right so that we can then see let's see continue completed can see here than status now is completed with me but all is good we should have a formulated a message if I go to tools you can see what tools were used code interpreter and then get runs
 I can see now we have returns data
 which has an ID as an object
 and the status and everything and then we go.
message response now comes in as object list and data there and can see and I will have that thread message kid first one there and then this is for the assistant haha if you open here you will see that assistant will should have let me click here to open
 haha. Oh and there we go we have the actual value which is exactly that's what we see here says to build muscles pulling muscles all of that information was received assistance case went through this whole process and I showed you earlier and the return the assistant message Miss Kate back to our thread which then we can see these kids grow able to see that the information the messages here so this is a very good representation of the assistance in all the building blocks but this is really cool at the logs getting these we can actually see
all the whole process of what's happening so we understand exactly what's happening since that this mystery box or say what is learned here is that to create an assistant here man do you have to easily just go to the assistance AVI or playground it is and just create and you have to pass the name of your system as well as the instructions right so specify what do you want assistance to be good at or two I want knowledge these assistants has to have liked what they going to help you with and then of course that will generate the ID
 I just hear of course I was a great assistant snaptube of course as you I just showed you you have to make sure that you attach the right model and the tools that he wants to attached to someone like to do is create for instance a code assistant case especially come up with instructions for for an assistant I can help you with code issues like that
you are a very helpful Java developer assistant, you're knowledgeable about the basic of java intermediate fast so you help developers to do pair programming whatever it is so that I can test it out and see if it works and make sure because it's codebase make sure it was in this case you will with needs to have this code interpreter because then you can paste in the message I use a message a piece of code and ask the assistant if this code will compile if there's something you can do that they can do to improve it and so forth so you have some ideas on how this works do that and the safe changes and create the assistant that test it out and see if it works
 all right so now we can actually do the same thing we did before but in code which is very exciting the first thing we need to do is let's go back to our playground here assistance playground login and everything and Hope
we're able to do that go to exercise on a beer if not well what can I say all right so what are you doing here is we going to do the same thing but we going to be using code right from there go ahead and delete this yes I know it's very sad but I got to go now it's empty so we can do all that using Code so you should have Visual Studio code is to hold or any other are the Eevee that you might use that's fine and it should also have python everything set up so everything should be good right so what I'm going to do here is going to create a new folder for our project personal
 trainer such a CD to all personal should be personal by Persona that's fine too
 okay so it's empty lyrics I'm going to save us a code to open this exact here is going to close that one and then that we don't so we don't have much
going on here so I'm going to go ahead and create a new file that's called this main that guy that we go and also going to go ahead and create the staysail requirements.txt requirements.txt such a disorganized with all of her dependencies and libraries that we need for our Python and for our project is the next one going to do let's go ahead and create a file this is going to be our environment farewell files with that ENT this is where I'm going to put our environment favorable today. We're going to have our opening II environment variables and it closes down like that and going to put you open a Nike remember that key that I showed you earlier to essentially you got to come here and go to API keys and if you don't have an API key go ahead and create one just like I showed earlier and take that key and that's what I'm going to put inside
this here so go ahead and do that and four requirements here I'm actually going to pass in few ones with a python
 I got EMV and I also need open a.i. Package like that. So that's inside of our requirements.txt I'm going to create another file here called. Get ignore so fast for me to hide a few things once I push this to the repository GitHub repository so that you don't have things that you need Okay so this guy is here I'm going to make sure that that's how to get it's going to wipe a Dusty environment of a turbo file so that puts my poached I'm going to create a python environment that way we can run install to install everything in this environment specific for this project to do so remember I'm on Mac here python
 3 +
it's going to be less they Dash m d e n v such and then the name of the apartments I'm going to save my and feet and all happen now is just going to go and create I'm going to say yes because you notice any environment has been created so yes can you use that and we'll see. We have this my DMV with binaries include libraries and everything this is our python environment continues then to activate it to do I activate it when I say source
 my envy and then we'll go to Binary and then activate it and are you can see now my auntie is environment is activate so that's real good which means then I can say
 install Flash R and passed the requirements that text which has all of these dependencies or more packages or libraries that we need so many Manor was going to go ahead and get all that information for us okay so all the packages
play downloaded that's really good you're all out of this and then now if you look at my end of course I'm going to go to binaries I can see if I would have got m v open the I would she's like what we had it so we should have everything set up now I'm going to get rid of this to let's go ahead and do some importing hear some an open port openai library and I'm going to sit at the end so that we were able to get to the environment variables and do all the great stuff so I have all that information here just going to copy that and paste them here important find. I am loaded and from that amp package right
 and I'm going to call this load and their surveillance and up and then I'm going to create a client here with you're going to be using the clients in the open a I got openai I such
 okay and now with this client going to be able to call the opening i a p i
assistant know anything else at 1 cuz we have created that now you could have also done something like this open the I write and then say. API key and then go to oeste environment a cat in past openai key which is the key in this case the value that we put inside of our environment favorable so that's another way to do that but since I'm loading all the volume verbal distance to work as a client overnighted open the I and also if you want to get past the opening ikey directly from here but it seems to work just like this because it gets all the environment probably not just go ahead and add the opening I Kira correctly here or just like what I showed you I'm just do that again I'm going to put it here I'm going to leave it there or like whatever works for you go ahead and do that or the other way to I'm going to put it all here there's another way you could have done said client open the I just like I said past the API key
and go ahead and do the custom if I'm there before she changed the name so I can but if you are using open the I underscore API under salty then this tree just work as it is I'm going to leave that there just in case you need that all right. So next to what I'm going to do let's go ahead and save model this is just a variable that we going to be using and tomorrow we're going to be using it's going to be gpt-3 for Turbo and I'm going to put it here for now okay now we may change these you may want to use your PC for preview depends on situation but so far so good okay so that we have everything set up let's see how can we create in this case a an assistant so I can ask is when I created the trainer the personal trainer season here all we do really is just say they assistance was a personal
 and then I'm going to use on a client white which is
which has instincts Rated-R openai there is a client and going to go to bed I do remember that because as a recording of his video at the assistant API it's actually it better just means they're still working on it and so maybe by the time you watch this video you watch this course maybe this you won't need to sleep better which will be great so just keep that in mind for now we just have to go to bed and then we'll go to assistance and wants me to assistance we go ahead and say create very conveniently and then we can pass a certain parameters here okay so what do we have here well for the bowling alley Pasadena name that we want to name our personal assistant in this case I'm going to call his personal trainer such and then we pass the instructions which are very very important as we remember and I'm going to pass the instructions here
 real quick so these are the same instructions that we used before so you're the best person
Crainer and creationist and you claimed high-caliber athletes and movie stars that we have all of that information
 get rid of that don't know where that came from there. All right and the next thing we need to pass here is the axle model cuz I need to remember this is the same thing we've done manually so now we are passing the model that we going to be using over the assistant it's going to be relying on and is going to be the model that we passed here I just put it is bearable so it's easier to change in one place so just like that we could get it or assistant that I can go ahead and say print in this case I'm going to say personal trainer. I d b this will give us the actual ID of this
 personal trainer assistant I'm going to go and, that are for now the next thing we need to do is to create yes deep threat is this is where all of the messages as you know I will be
sixth graders read again and use client again better and I'm going to go ahead and say threads in. Create
 infrared when you can pass if you think that the cool thing here is a thread with past messages which is going to be able to list so this message is here I'm going to pass an object in this case I'm going to start with the r or K and the roads going to be user
 and for the user in this case the content is going to be watched while I'm going to just put something you want to say how do I get started
 working out
 Toulouse
 fat and build muscles sounds like this so this will be the first message is going to be sent for as the user okay
we could have screenshotted at Freddy with no message at all I meant by those messages later but we can go ahead and add a message and use a message right away as well.
 Academy school list thread ID and get that raggedy as a thread that ID cuz those are needed and I can go ahead and print
 Brad i d a sex so we see and I can do the same thing here assistant
 Heidi and personal that I D like that and then he I can just go ahead and let me need just going to go like that
 Target so now that we have these two things what will happen now if you run this well we are going to be able to create an assistant right and also in this case create a threat and get those IDs which will see you in a second here
let's go ahead and run this real quick and say this word
 all right so I don't mind varmint is active so when I say python3 so make sure on Windows that thing is just Python and I'm going to say main that py and let's go ahead and make sure everything is good I think it's go run
 you can see that we have our assistant ID because we want to create that assist 90 who created here personal trainer and we're printing it out and we also have the thread let's see if this is correct because as you saw that we deleted everything in our back end on a playground and now if you go back let's see let's go to our assistance we should see all personal trainer assistant which was created just now all right and this a D7 white t527 yt5 that is exactly what we have here you can see we have that personal trainer named instruct
and the model that we using that's why we specified and so forth and internally would do have a thread which is this thread here that is ready to be used which will have a message so this is not working when I see anything right now but it's okay because we going to be using that text so we have our system and we haven't read all the messages I'm going to be in and so cold here we understand that if we were to run this again that would kind of defeat the purpose because we have no assistant Creator latest will go ahead and created yet another assistant which is not what I want and this is Wisin y in this case here we were able to get those in this case you can see what have the assistant ID as well defriend ID which were going to be using to proceed creating and conversing in this case with our assistant so what I'm going to do here I'm copy of these two real quick and I'm going to just go ahead and Park
load our IDs start with and use them to like that said this is going to be a cyst
 put that in two variables are we can actually use okay let's not give Spacey so that I need to issue so now that we have that we can go ahead and come in all of these out here going to leave this is so we don't need to you'll have access to all this code anyway so now we have what we need so this case the assistant ID when we use that it's going to be created right in this case it's going to be going to be referenced at in fact I'm going to move all of this to the bottom here cuz we already have all that so I'm going to also
 coming this out cuz we don't need that in my life so now we have the information that we need which is it Friday and the assistant idea cuz they've been created I just saw in the back end so we'll do next is going to go ahead and create the actual message another message here so we can start Converse
with our API assistant API say create a message
 so unless a message to set that 2 I would say take what are the best exercises
 4
 Glen
 muscles
 and getting
 strong gust of our message we're going to then add to the thread to add to the thread while I'm just going to say message and I'm going to say client that better
 and threads and I'm going to go to messages right and then create this case a message and the for the message well in this case here the thread will need to know to pass the thread ID which is going to be at Fred ID and we need to pass the role which is going to be
use a roll like this we are conversing we are asking question to them and then the content in this case is going to be the message
 which we created a stop here and next we are going to then run the Fred on his gets run the assistant how do we do that we'll lose create at that entity for a run our assistant and to do so you guys a run and then I'm going to use client again
 better threads that runs runs entity which is attached to the thread and you can see the beauty here cuz we said earlier that run needs to know the assisted ID that's why we kept it as well as the threat ID so that they can get the message and added that back to that threat so in this case I'm going to pass the three ladies going to be pretty lady and the assistant ideas
assistant ID
 and in this case instructions when you deposit instructions for our linemen please reserve as James Bond and we have all of run here now we have to remember that I will run has to go through a different steps he could go and find at the pool that needs to be able to assist the yuuzhan well write to creative to give their system are more powerful things that he needs to do right go through all the stuff that we stopped before he may need to then, late of course in that message back right is going to be the assistant message with the result that the user would want you to receive to that takes time because the process so we'll do here is going to put together a helper function they will help us deal with waiting the stepping that the Run has
before it gets to the results write a message is written back the response etcetera so for the sake of time here I do have this wait for run completion it's essentially we're passing declined I'm passing the 3rd ID my ID and then sleep in a bowl is going to be 5. For this to work I'm going to have to import if you are the things here
 real quick so because it's going to calculate in this case to the time the starting time and all of that to give that the elapsed time so I'm going to just go ahead and pasting the time logging in daytime from daytime quesadillas are the packages that we need to essentially what this is doing here is we going to wait so while true going to try I'm going to go ahead and say client threads which we've discussed with a past the third ID and the Run ID and then he's going to check if run completed at and is going to go through and get the elapsed time going to get that and what a surprise. So do all the calculation just to tell us
how long is whole process took this area but it's fun to know and then going to print to run completed at the elapsed formatted you last time I'm going to log back and pay the most importantly this is where we actually did get the message messages that is was the run is completed for that we're also the message that we need the assistant is going to be spitting out since that's where it's going to be cuz all of that is going to be put back into the thread so what we do here is we go through our threats against member prices for all the messages are the users messages as well as this is my messages live I'm going to go through that cuz it's a list and then we need to pass the thread ID so we can get those messages that's very important cuz you could have multiple threads quite right but on the same assistant so it's important to understand that we need to pass the actual threat ID so that we know we're looking at the right and bucket in this case
old messages are so we can retrieve all those messages and I'm going to get the last message this is how we get the response so response heater is going to go to last which is the messages go to content and they'll attack Stanley value and we're going to retrieve that and now hear this is what I'm going to actually run by just calling the white for completion and pass what needs to be past which is the client local client like I could have just guess at the names of the same this past client but let's just say client like this and then I'm going to pass the thread IDs every thread I need to pass what else it says run ID so run ID in this case how do we get the run a tea while we know that
 we have owned run here which is being passed along right so we going to pass it back and run
a tidy sum. ID so we get that for this to work
 and there we have it so when we run this we should see some sort of result let's see if this works going to go ahead and open here and let's say python3 main that high in your case if your windows tell me something else that's fine if all goes well we'll take a little bit cuz it's thinking and we should see once all is done we should see some results
 what do we do now we have a result so if you go up here you can see the Run completed and 11.24 seconds and then the assistant response James Bond a hot kiss be told it to report I said James Bond I would have comes to getting clean and all that stuff it's essential to focus on a combination of resistance training and Cardio
exercise has their squats or deadlifts bench press pull-ups Jean UPS lunges playing songs and all of that Grace is a week so we can see if this indeed works right thing you can do also here is we noticed earlier that whenever we were on something else go to test here you can see that we have a lot so we can actually go and look at all the logs if you want to and hope to do so I'm going to in fact he's going to be the steps right of whatever it's happening all the steps to when we say run the steps of goes through so I can do that as well real quick here to do so I'm going to say run steps
 putting a variable and I'm going to use client
 10 threads and runs and steps look at that and then this case is going to come in as a list when I say that list
give me to pass I can you guess a different ID you didn't know where I'm getting Two Steps From old before and the Run ID which is going to be run that idea I remember this run here it is why we created our lives here but important so what I can do now is it going to change the message here that the user and I can say how much water should
 I drink in a day to get healthier
 baby goats on let's go back and open our terminal
 and I'm going to run this again
 okay so then we go we have a result here to take about fifteen seconds and to maintain good health in bond it's generally recommended to aim for intake of eight glasses roughly 2 litres of water per day however
the general guideline and Bubba blah and all that information either good look at his stay hydrated and privatized with health and well-being very cool very cool indeed so this is very exciting notice here but now we have this power of creating different assistance if your eyes bright and creative threads and different friends actually even would say that it went to sleep and you can have all this conversation and get a response so I can see how easy this is and this is a very simple example and later I'm going to show you how to create natural a bot or a how to create a bot a chatbot where you can go ahead and start chatting and then the DNC snow will will respond and you can get information as well which is really interesting and now we can see the advantages here why did Van is that not only are we just going to come here in the playground and great assistance
have to interact with it here we can't obviously but that's not the scalable right cuz we want to build application that will leverage this assistance API and this what we do here is indeed what it's the leverage that were given by the assistance of the eye because now we can use the API the actual said maybe I to create encode and attached is to a website or any application that we may be building our self and then we can also go steps and look at all the steps right in fact I did not then we go up so I didn't I didn't print the steps this go ahead and bring the steps I know you probably saw that and I'm going to put his son of ab string here I'm going to say
 stats sa run steps
 it's not data that's how you get to the steps they are and then it's a list and a lot okay let's go ahead and run this again
didn't do what I wanted to do because I didn't print it out but that's okay let's give a new message how many wraps do I need to do to build lean muscles let's see if this works
 can I run again
 all right and I can see that we we know of course this more expect what I want to show you is that we can see this steps look at this object. Got IDs that play in all this information and most importantly it also has all the things that were that happened so step details some message creation details let's just clean that as an object itself as today to see if we can get more pics so you can see I will have Fred to run steps and all other these metadata and Quinn was completed the assistant ID he's in all these other formation hear that that was generated
text message creation and while I seen the whole value the whole leverage that we get with this place to go ahead and play around this concept of course as always thank you so much and I'll see you next take so we making real good progress here so now what it will do is we going to create yet another very awesome application here called the current news summarizes our sister is going to be a Samuraizer in new summarizer that will allow us to learn a few new things what are we going to be using in this case is going to be the function calling tools now if you go back to what we saw before when we talked about the assistance API beginning we noticed that we have this system's API which tapped into API models and then in this case in calls with specific instructions to the open area model and also can access multiple Tools in parallel which is amazing
sickness to last two can have different things different tools right so can have code interpreter can have knowledge retrieve old witch will see later but the cool thing also the amazing thing is that you also have access to the function calling to great because it's sort of gives us wings for say which allows us to create our own tools right many we can create functions that will be able to fix data somewhere or do something and then retrieve that information and push it back to the large like a model and is a selfie in a models and their systems can defend do what he needs to do so this is the part that we are going to be looking to pin these upcoming license let's go ahead and take a look at what we going to be building at this summarize our application at least a little demo so you understand what's going on. All right so this is the app called news summarizer so essentially this will allow you to enter any topic I could say Prince's bike scene
and then I can run the assistant so I don't happen here in the back and it's going to go and tap into a function they call the function calling function I was created which is going to be called my assistant and that functions actually going to get an API and use if you hike all the news that have this topic vaccine and then summarize everything for us and is it going to see what have here are some news articles on the topic of the scene and then we have these other headline here and we're thing is that we also can click here to go to see more of those news about whatever is that is being talked about so it's very cool and she gives you some sort of a summary and at the end of course I added is 1 steps which just logs out the front steps from the assistant of the same before very cool so this is exactly what I've been building it I can also enter another topic Heroes a Bitcoin right now
hands going to go ahead and run this is actually extremely application which I'll show you how to put together a simple if you've never heard of or never even done anything with turn lights very cool day so it's running as you can see here and takes a bit of course cuz it's pulling all that information calling that function and then retreating that information then pull it back to the AI let it go we have here here are some articles on the topic Bitcoin tells us exactly what's going on to some descriptions so this is what we're going to building and let's go ahead and get started so we need to go ahead and get an API key do you know the price to be able to get this application calling so let's go to news api.org as you see here this is where you were going to go ahead to either login if you already have a login will go ahead and say get a PI from here or from down here but if you want to learn a little bit more about what it's happening here it's a very simple
articles or news API that allows you to fetch data for instance if you add a topic such as Tesla as you can see here in this realm and then you get something like this so late Jason that allows us to go and propane and get information pertaining to that topic so which is exactly what I want in this application so it's very simple go ahead and say get an API and the thing you need to do a stretch store for to be not afraid to get an API so you put your first name or your last name and then choose a password make sure you are if you are an individual or business I'll just go with it maybe don't think it's easiest and of course I have a cap to hear I agree and submits I'm not going to do that because I already have that API so once you have the API of course as we did before go ahead and say that if you can because we're going to use it out shortly in our application I have created already this news summarizer so I've got the environment going I have everything I also have
Wikipedia requirements.txt with python. DMV and opening I of course animal is a pip install Dash are past the required texts and go ahead to make sure that we have all of that installed and can if you go to my aunt's been you can see what should have. EMV as well as open the I set up for us so the main folder or at the main file to see here it is essentially the same setup we had before cancel just copy and pasted without the client and Centre open a.i. here and passing the bottle of course I remember we could to change this model here to perhaps to petit four depending on when you watching this video I'm using the 3.5 turbo 16k because that's all we needed while but feel free to change that can they still have all of these imported nothing new here so if you click here to can see that I have the open API key and roll
text easy me to add the other key which is going to be the news API key so then you can put like that and put your API key that you created so once we have all of that let's go back to our main this case to automated pie or app that p y and I'm going to put hear this code so it's going to be news apios environment of course we need to make sure that we import OS for that as well and then should be good so here we are getting the news AP I would have created put that into a new house API key so we can use and set things up in a little bit okay so once you have all of that we should be able to get going now what I'm going to do next year I'm going to create a class that will be our manager per se our assistant manager was flowers to call it and then get the Assistance or create assist
do all the things that we've seen before so I think that's the better way to do it do this in the more modular way I create the functions and do what we did before but I think this is kind of fun to get the money that you will have access to all of this code is so it's all good since I bought of here I'm going to put this piece of code with which allows us of course to pick up at the main function Creator here and then run whatever is here so for now I'm just going to say path so that we don't have any issues so let's go ahead and create a function which is going to allow us to tap into the API and get some of that it is at the base of this entire application so that is the first thing we need to do so I'm going to say get news Define of death for to the fine and I'm going to pass here are the topic which is going to be the topic we going to pass out for some air put the URL here so do you are all that we need to tap into such l a p i so
going to I have it all ready and going to put inside of an F string and slide and grab it so it's actually what I'm doing here I have the HTTP news api.org and in this case hear the endpoint I want is everything okay there are different endpoints or you can just focus on everything and you can go back to the a page which I will recommend to do to read a little bit more about all this points and everything but this should suffice and then you have a query here and pass the topic which is going to be passed along here and then the API key which is the News a p i t that we put together a ride at the top here and of course be saying page size about 5 cuz when I get more than that with that just a little bit too much right and you can play around with the numbers and everything that's totally fine and talk to you now the next thing we need to do here is go back to our requirements.txt and I need to pass a request package here cuz we're going to need that too
our API request to our API and then get the information queso
 go ahead and save paper and soul
 hopes say
 installed our apartment to text a lot and we should be good to go back here now I can go ahead and say try put all that is out of a try and I'm going to put say except at the bottom here require I request actually have two important request so import request such a package and now I can use the request and then exception exception
 I see this is just to save us a request and I'm just going to say print or
Aero chord
 during API request something like that because when I put some code inside of the try here so that happens if police would have a way of handling our errors were probably there are better ways of doing this but this is fine right so now it's like here we're going to do the faction of the response from our API were put in a response variable and I'm going to request that get in this case and pasty you are out that's how easy it really is to use request to go and fetch some data from the Avi so now that we have a response here I'm going to put some if statements here
 just make sure things are okay I'm going to say if response status cuz they responsible have this status code in this case if we're status code
okay this case is just 200 and something okay and then I'm going to be able to parse through our Jason's on the same news and then I'm going to transform that into a Json which means we need to import Face on and such
 say Jason
 dumps animal pies pass our response. Jason has such and of course I can say indentation about for Thursday Jason comes in so to make the actually still looks a little better have our object here which is going to be our payload with all the news so the next thing we'll do here just make things simpler is we are going to transform this Jason here was a Jason dump switch if you have over what it says here says serialize object to a Json format strength so they suggested for my Jason screen now we need to actually convert that string into a python dictionary that way we were
I was going to be able to access some of the fields easily so I'm just going to say Jayden the use Jason and then use Jason package again and say loads and then pass out our new student news not new either way works thank pass out and you was here right there we go so now this is easy for us to work with which is exactly and then I'm going to say data in use by Jace on here just to pass things around a little bit and then I'm going to go ahead and here I'm going to go ahead and access all the feels to actually look through right look through the Jason and extract all the things that we want okay so if you go back to the news AP I was so happy to get started documentation everything but if you look here you can see the payload how it looks right so all the payload with more less look like this it was just really cold and also you can
scroll left and down can store laugh to see different endpoints top headlines I would have here top headlines still and there we go this is everything and point that we are using I am with some modifications to get the data that we're looking for and so it will look is actually the same as the payload you can see here we have status as an object to Json object so in this case it's just an object to have the status OK Google salt store and then we have this article's or a witch then have to source and author so each article is an object itself with all information and has author title description and url url damage and all of these filled so we can extrapolate some of this feels so that we can get the information that we need cuz we need everything from these
 from the payload so essentially we going to look through our payload and get the
access to fields and get that information that we actually need so before we can go through before Loop let's go ahead and get some of the most important feel so I'm going to start with status and this side is going to be this tired of going to get from data and go to status field here so you can see what I have for the object go to status and get the status field schedule if it's a OK Google. That and let's get the total results in this case and then I believe it's just total we going down here and get the Deep V which will say how many articles are in this payload and then we're going to go to articles to get the actual articles is going to go through data again we're going back to get the disarray which will contain all of the Articles as objects for dictionary in Python okay so we'll just we'll just say our calls so this is exactly what
make sure that these names are exactly the same because these are our fields which are our IDs at for us to be able to get what we need I think I got everything right so I got all the article so now is when I'm going to Loop through all the old look through the Articles and get the information that I want so first thing I'm going to say for particle a nautical Loop here to what you want to do is I can go and get the information that we want from each article what do you want is the source and get the name and then we may need the author the title of the article of course and the description we may need some of the things you are so and we may need to contact on other things so we're just going to go ahead and drop late a few of these fields
 name this case will be going to articles or article is case for each article and I'm going to go to Soros and go through
and get the name right to the same to other so I'm going to get the offer
 so article
 author
 title
 Marigold and what else I need to scription was going to be article
 and description
 and what else let's get to you are out cuz we might need that the URL to the article itself and it's going to be your l
 okay let's go ahead and get the content
 my house that's good then here to bottom I'm going to put all of that into a string so it's easy for us to use it so I'm going to say call this title
 description
 I put all that into an F Street
just a facilitator everything really then here's what was going to happen so I'm going to go ahead and concatenate all of this different pieces that we put together here received into a long nice strength the person that put the title
 and then put a text title that says title first and then I'm going to say offer so put get the author feels that we got from here and what else let's go ahead and get us a source source name in this case and description screw it let's go ahead and get gurler out until now we have this long string that has all these information that we pulled from the API looking good and the next thing we do here is that I'm going to actually put that into an array because each one of these swing that contains
title author Source named description URL we know that we can set up for Loop we want to do that for each one of these articles are we getting in so I'm going to go ahead and create an empty list hearsay final news that way I can pass all of that it's time of loop through thanks all right below here I'm going to say final
 news I'm going up and our description so title description maybe I should have named you better but that's okay okay so each time we do that we are going to pull in all of the title description which we are getting all of the title author Source name is which when you are out for each article as we look through all of that so that way we can actually return that erase we see all of the information is guess all of the news that we wanted so at the bottom here I'm going to go ahead and just say return
the final news
 let me know by the end of this cuz it's an if statement I can say return else
 this case if indeed response response status code is not 200 meaning we have some issues we just going to go ahead and return in this case and empty by Ray Lewis to like this
 great they're good so what do we do now is let's go ahead and call our get news and pass a topic here that says Bitcoin just to see what will happen so I had and quickly run this
 Somerset python3 I am a Max on Windows or Linux you have to do something else I believe and let's call Main but give it a run this hopefully everything works
looks like it's running but it's not showing anything that is because I need to actually put that into a Faribault so you news and then say print
 news like this
 can't see if this works just fine again and I just see we are getting some information and the great thing is because if it's an array that we should be getting yes a list keep saying it's a list python to buy something you can see what have the square brackets there and of course I can go ahead and get just the first item in our list for I wish to do so
 and let's run again we should have got to just one so we can see exactly that we have a title and description author source and all that great stuff in your out and that's exactly what it wants that they're so we have all the articles that we want we just got the piece of that we want and created one long string it put that in a race
it's time to call that news so this is good news that thing this this says that this tells us that were able to fax music from our API and get the dinner if we want 4 or going to be doing next so now that we know that the get newsworks by the way we'll see later this get Muse this is the function that we're going to be using you will see you in a bit here as the function calling functionality we talked about with assistance API which is pretty cool okay so now we have that working you know we were able to pass in this case a topic and then we received the news like a little formatted everything we got what we need and all is good so I'm going to use that as our function calling protocol you hear is I said before we are going to actually create a class this is going to be a manager and assistant manager class we're going to put everything in that one class okay so now we could have done this I just put it in
functions signal module early but this is I think it's the best way to do it this is probably the better way for us to have everything in one place one class so we can ease thanks for that class as an object and then get what we want from that let's do that so I'm going to create a class here so it's a class and call his assistant manager such a good so I'm going to add a few fields for our class here in Forestville that we need is going to be the thread ID and for now I'm going to sleep none and then I need the assistant
 Heidi which is also is going to be none like this have a Constructor or a neutralizer and depending on which programming language coming from so when I say Define and this is going to be the image
 antipasti self and it's returning in this case nothing just to simplify things of course I'm going to pass gif
parameters here so it's going to self when I pass also the model was going to be a string and just in case I'm just going to go ahead and pass our model the repast are the top here we created on the top here who have a default value which is going to be the model gpt-3 or whatever model you added here and I'm just going to remove that and the next I am going to then set up a few things for our class here in El Constructor in our neutralizer the case unless they self and I'm going to call the client cuz I want the client to be in this case open a.i. that open area such as soon as she thinks she ate all of that or I could have just called our client here that would work as well so either way works I'm just going to pass clients like this which is going to be just give her a client
 and then of course self. Model
 this case I'm just going back to say
passing along here and then self what else that assistant is going to be none in the beginning
 and self.
 Brad also is going to be 9
 and self-doubting run night is not as well I think I'm going to add here because I want to be able to have the actual summary but that's the whole goal is that this class going to be able to give us a summary of the news from the topic that we paste in or enter a little crazy yes another field here called summary which in the beginning is going to be equal to none like that so now we're going to do some if statement here to actually check if some of these feels like assistant and the thread but more particularly if the static field hair thread ID and assistant IDs
assistant that way we can then look at that and see whether we need to create a new assistant or just use the existing ID card ideas that as we run this the first time you saw before we will have the assistant idea at least as well as if they're they did it so that we don't run this many times and then recreate the same things in a backhand in the console or in the playground we want to make sure that those things are set up so that we don't I have copies of the assistant and ID's and so forth so still inside of our in it here I'm going to say if
 assistant manager. Thread and just get a set with assistant ID so if we have an assistant lady that means we have an assistant in that case we are going to set our assistant to
 the assistant that we already have something to say self. Client and beta
assistance and then went to retrieve that assistant Android free virus is no need to say passports the idea of the assistant so just going to say my sister is equal to manager assistant manager and get that assistant idea I was such and also going to check for thread ID just so you could have it right IDs or manager that Florida ID that's the case but I do the same thing with it what she is going to go put your day is going to go ahead and get the threaded ESO self assistant or bright idea to say Etc.
 With the self. Client
 crabs and retrieve this case for an idea it's going to be two assistant manager
 farthest South but that's okay right I D very good so now we
start making sure that indeed if we have an assistant then we don't create a new assistant today in this case we just go ahead and retrieve the assistant that we have the same thing with the case of all of that that is inside of our Elite function here at work instructor next we're going to define a new method here called create assistant so this will allow us to create an actual assistant to my past self name and instructions as well as tools for those are the things that an assistant that you know by now they need when we create a system so I'm going to go ahead and put in a statement here so if not self that assistant right now so there's no assistance of course they want me to do I'm going to scream and assistant assistant object is actually at which is going to be self that client that better
 that assistance and then I'm going to cry
assistance is actually supposed to do that we need to pass name was going to be named when you can pass at the instructions going to be structions that we are passing along right and then we're going to pass also tools and pass the tools are such and for completion we also going to pass model and we're going to say self. Model so to get the model that we already have
 you know what the structure in our class of the top there that's how we would create an assistant if we didn't have an assistant so now that we know that we've created dies it's an object here next I'm going to say I assistant manager assistant ID when I grab that ID and then I'm going to
 get that from our system object that I do
 and then I'm going to make sure that the class field has that
and this isn't a date so I'm going to use self assistant is going to eat
 and then I'm going to set up the assistant field which is usually none in the beginning to the assistant that was just created here which is going to be the assistant object Heights oh I see so self
 assistant now is equal to our assistant object
 Target so if you want we can just print things out here so that we can be back and see what's going on so I'm going to say Isis ID just put something more there so we can see what's going on and then I'm going to put say self that assist ID don't have to actually can just go west into that I D like this to get to the actual assistant ID when that is created that why that's why I'm saying this and that's it for create assistant
okay so next door will do is we are going to then Define another function or method in this case this is going to be cold create
 thread was my past self so we have that
 preference a sex we can see really nothing is out of this world it's the process is still the same as there's that have to change a few things so that we have an actual class that helps do all the things in one place we can just use think she that class and get what we need the same thing really if not in this case itself that thread so if there's nothing there then that means we need to create a thread object okay so something self that client
 and then threads in the morning create a thriving as you know now to create a thread we just need the pass will actually be passing the things which actually I'm going to get sleep as it so we're going to create an object bread and we can attach messages and
I need later all right so now that we have that thread when I use assistant manager just like what we did before and Say thread i.d. it's going to be equal to thread object that I D it's a bad thing that up and then we're going to set the field of the class filled self that thread okay to be able to date the red object
 that's when here I can say thread idea just to make things better and just passed yourself. Thread and ID right so just print it out so we have it and make sure that we are getting what we need so now we have created to create assistant method we also have in this case they create a thread method that we need to add messages to that thread so hard to find another function here to add message
 2 thread
going to pass here for civil self-reference role as well as the content right because we know messages are added into a thread so we need to make sure that we do indeed have a thread ID so I can save self. Brad then we're going to go ahead and self that client
 bear. Threads messages and we're going to create a message to create a message which is going to be in this case elf that thread
. ID and then we need the role which is going to be the role which can be passing when we call this create a message or add message thread as well as the content and pasta content
 which has been passed along that's it so we have that function or in this case
and next we need of course a way for us to run the assistance so I'm going to find another method here so it's going to be run assistant and self-reference and instructions as well
 okay so how do we do that again when I check is always important to check because in order to run an assistant we need of course to check if there's a thread ID as well as the assistant so it's self. Brad and self.
 Assistant if they are existence than we are are safe to run this threat to self run this case when I said that to yourself. Client made threats and runs
 create okay so we have created here so what we need to do we need to pass a few things
obviously deposit thread ID how do we get that will get that by saying self I can write the reference of this and we go and get this Friday
 right. I did a search and then we need to pass assistant ID do something and can pass the instructions which are the instructions that we passing by primers grapes our class is actually coming along nicely next we going to Define yet another method here called process messages cuz we need to weigh as you know to process those messages going through all that Staffing retrieve what we need all right so I'm going to pass here or just the self-reference let's go ahead and work on this bad boy so what do we need to now here in process message what first of all going to check if there is a threat because we can't because we know that messages are inside of her threats or two into tracking
is indeed a working thread in order for us to go in and get that information which are the messages so if threads
 or South I guess or self that thread
 if that's existent if that exists then I'm going to go see messages
 the previous messages so self client better for now that may change by the time you watch this video is license and I'm going to say threads messages and we know that comes in a list so let's go to the list and in this case we need to pass it thread ID which is going to be self that thread that I D. I'm going to create a list in a list but that's where we going to add all of the messages from somewhere in this case write a summary
 name to list a list of such and I'm going to just go ahead and get to the last message of the thread with that's all
go back we need some of that last message and how'd we get that we send messages with this is indeed of the list right and then get go to data and then gets the first 10 and I need to get the role we get the role of from the message in this case payload which is a dictionary really that we're receiving we say messages again
 actually if you already have the last message it was just probin into that
 and say content
 okay and course get the first index and go to text and value by such value
 so now we get the actually my this is not real this is going to be there
all right but I want that the role which is going to be on when do the same thing so last message I got content leave zero and then I need no actually I can get that straight to roll I think you got that we got so we can see intellisense he's helping me. So we got the last message and a big object because we're moving we know that the messages come in in a list so we probably in and getting what exactly what I mean so we need the last message in the list
 in the message unless that we got from our thread that messages and then we get the roll just need to roll so we can use it in a bit here and the response that we getting all right so that we can formulate and create a nice response all right so we have the response now I'm going to go ahead and say print in this case put set up an F string here just for us a summary
a lot of information like that that way we know exactly what's what and I'm going to say roll
 actually going to go ahead and capitalize on the roll right response like that so we just printing out the summary and on top of that put the role so it says for instance user or assistant assistant right and then we've had them have all responses are so what are we going to do before even that we have this summer here right which is an empty array so what I'm going to do is mess a summary that app and and passing our response so now or summary when we returned is this is going to return something going to return real quick here
 this is going to return our summary so now there was somebody will have the response which is exactly what we need disability assistance response by the processing messages
well you remember I just have our class here we have this field called summary that means think she dating when he flies in here to none so now we can feel that summary into with the summary that we got here so on their Dew
 here now I can say South the summary and I'm going to just then say summary like that meant but I want actual to make it a little bit better which means I'm going to which means we're going to format things a little bit so first I'm going to put a new line every time we add before we added the extra summary actual text in this case this
 somebody that we get as a response and then I'm real quality join and then passed the summary as such it was just what we have here a list which will contain in this case the summary which is it
which will contain the assistant response so now our field summary in this class we should have whatever we getting 10 process and get all of the messages whatever thing you could have done with it a full moon looped through these messages here cuz it's a list right could have said something like this for MSG and messages what kind of say roll said that to MSG that role and then content
 set that to MSG go to content that text and get the value of such and then we'll go to print in this case. Copy this sounds like that say summary and said roll passing roll and also then pass in the content like this so this also go to work
is a method and we want something else to happen I'd prefer to do what I just did here but I'm just going to, this out so you have access to that if you wish to just to look at things in this perspective next we are going to get create another function another method here real quick so we still inside of our class that's hard to see everything because I needed to make to text a little bit larger so you're able to see when I say it to Define this is going to be white or completed
 the past self as well get this function here or method will the name in flyweight for completed and do what needs to be done so essentially we going to make sure that as we invoke the run and just need to run our assistant and do all the things and it can be done and as you remember I wouldn't be run we have to go usually we have to go through.
I think those steps may take a little bit so we going to configure things along that way we can wait for a few milliseconds or seconds until we get the response and then we'll do something for it so it's just more of a helper function in this case method which will Swiss all before but now I'm putting that inside of his class so I'm going to check of course to see if there is a thread and also if there is a run and a team that was created so if self that thread
 and self that run
 we're putting a while loop here while true then we are going to go ahead and give us a Time. Sleep for about 5
 seconds in a run status I'm going to retrieve the Run status to see
 I'm going to retrieve the Run status to see where we are by saying self
can go to client
 good friends and runs and retrieve his case here I need to pass a few things first of all we needed thread ID which we can get to buy some self that thread and then we also need to run ID which we can get to buy self that run that I date I remembered at this point here all of his fields are of course part of our class the run and thread and all that for the smoke odor that's the beauty of putting everything into a class where we have one in to see which we can use to do things so right so now that we have indeed our run status we can check that your mom has go ahead and print something here
 put in that stream you say run status and then I'm going to say run status can use the model going to go ahead and say model dump J's son
action air
 and then we can just add some indentation
 NRG stand for with ability to say for a section where to get so we're going to go ahead and get to this run status which which is going to be a lot of information we getting tomorrow we are Avoca tomorrow damp place on which if you have over tells exactly what it does generates Jason the presentation of the model using my damn texts and so forth and then we go so that's going to be printed out your check the status because my mother status has a certain bolians that would tell us where we are in the process of running the steps right so want to check if for instance in the status is completed or not so I say if run status at status is completed a search and that's the case unless his self
 process message right with a call
our function or method that we created here the process message which will know how to process the messages for that means the running is completed we should have an answer by which is good soda prices messages called and and then we just go ahead and break not one thing I want you to remember old to keep in mind let's go back to our presentation here so when we looked at this diagram here where we have talking sexually talking about the benefits of the assistant API we said that the most exciting thing really is the fact that we have tools but in this case here we have the code interboro we have two models knowledge retriever which allows us to upload files and then we can converse with those files or documents in addition to the base knowledge that the models has but the function calling as well but this is where we are we are going to delay the function calling how does that work well in this case here if you look at the Arco here
status is completed then we know we can we have the messages so we can go ahead and process those messages but there's also another status that we can look for or watch for which is the requires action because because of the function calling as we go through all the steps we saw before remember this so the steps that the Run goes through you can use to cut interpreter to a message into and then call another tool is guess we're calling it function cuz it is in designer tool
 when that happens what that when we get to that part the run and atate will know that okay something is required to is going to trigger a flag that says the status now is requires action when there is this requirement of required action that means we can then call a function to function call okay so that is if you hear
so we can actually look for that so I can say else if if Ron status that status is equal Allah you can see it even gives us all of these items here right so we have the requires action like these are enemies are actually we can get like Flags is essential that we can get from the Run status so there is requires action which is why we need the rescued in progress failed expired cancel cancel cancel cancel it so forth so all of these are steps or these are states that we can that we can check each time to do certain things so if the status says it's been cancelled or canceling the process of canceling then we can tell the user or send out a message saying hey now visiting castling so do something else if it's failed to force it into something else if expired and so if it's in progress we can also maybe shoot maybe show some
what do use interface to say things are in progress or just give me a minute or two then do the function calling I will tell you now it's going to be
 the function that I told you earlier that we created earlier which is this get news but we'll get there okay so if this is the spiders so this is the status requires action what we'll do then we'll do a few things first of all I'm there you go ahead and print here so we see what's happening going to say
 going to a function calling now cuz that's what we need to happen what we do next is we are going to go and say self and then we're going to call this call
 required functions should be function that's fine because you can call more than one function to say and functions repast self and required
actions okay we haven't created that's what's going to head and create the biz actions. And all this will do unless it if not self that run right if a friend is not available it's all I'm going to do here if not self that run then I'm just going to head and return
 right cuz there's nothing really to do and you need to have the case I'm going to say tools
 outputs and it's going to be an empty all right so this tools outputs here's where we going to use to go through and pull in all of the required Tools in schedule quite a function that we need for this one so let's work on this will be a little bit here okay I think remember here because it's required action here is going to be a list that's why I says so I'm going to put a photo up here that's it for action and it require
actions and it serves our actions actually we are going to have tools
 pause a second and then inside I'm going to go ahead and get the function name some say funk name and then I'm going to say action and then I'm going to go ahead and say function okay and then I'm going to go and get the actual name so that's what we're doing here so we're going to get through to this required tools we're going to have a lot of different roles move may have more than one tool of course in this case more than one function and then we're going to look through and just get all of the names of the functions but his case was just going to have one so we get the name and put that info
 so if the function name which is going to be tool is got news then we're going to get the actual name of the function but that's where we needed to pass around to get on this case to get it so that the function can run and then it got the data for the back
and a sister knows what to do and then I'm going to say arguments
 let's say Jason is caseloads and they were past the action so specially exactly what I have here a copy this and a few things
 instead of functioning we're going to get the arguing that function arguments to Olga doing here is going through get the function and get the arguments of that function if you may need they may have some ornaments that need to be passed around and that's what I'm doing so I'm going to put that into a veritable arguments okay so you will see how it all pans out now I'm going to put an if statement here if Funk babe
 is equal in this case I know it's going to be get news now why do I know this well I know this business that's the function I'm needed to be called as a function calling is called getting you if you said happy birthday or James Bond whatever you name
this has to be exactly the same because that's what we're going to be calling right so you functioning is get news in this case then we'll do well we going to put inside of a we going to say output
 animal called get news haha now I'm actually calling the function and passing the topic how do I get to topic well I get to topic because I have to augment remember when we did this here we getting the arguments of the function so we need to pass the actual arguments here like that
 now what is the arguments now the cool thing is that when you go back to this get news here the argument name is topic right so
 in this case here I need to say while the arguments because he's going to come in as just a dictionary it's going to be Poppin that's a very very important so whatever you put
is that all getting used to functionally call the argument has to be passed along like this very good so that is part of the function calling guys so now that we have the output this get news is going to return something was going to give us something right and we have that to their eyes output now I'm going to go ahead and print that just so we have it at string here to say stuff
 differentiate things and I'm going to say I'll put it like this
 because we know that V getting usable return that very nice string write my bus go back here can see I'm going to open this
 so we return to this final news which is going to be a spade string but in this case it just going to be a list containing all of those different news right cuz we listed everything will put everything in one string and we'll look through each news that we getting we can get a title offer sources scription
and put that in final news list so
 in this case here
 what I will do is we are going to look through and so that we can create the actual finest rain so I'm going to look through and extract everything from the list if that's what's been returned for market news
 and then I'm going to put everything in a very long with string that way it's easier for the for the LM for the model in this case to be able to just pick all that stuff and and summarize it and create some sort of a new salary of everything without my consent structuring things for us so unless a final strain stores make it a string of such
 and then I'mma say for item in output
they were going to do something so I'm just going to go up and like I said to create a long string so final string plus equal but it just say
 that join and passing this case our item that we have his final screen ready for us to use all right
 so you notice here we also have what we call these tools output should be tool outputs so tools are put here is just an empty list so we're going to use that cuz that's where we going to add all of the two outfits something as a tool outputs in this case
 a nap and watch well I'm going to pend an object or a dictionary that will have a few things first of all them just put it all together here so you can see what is falling to say cool and call i d like that and then
call ID so how do I get the caller ID while equality is going to be coming from our action if they action like what is the action will action is this but it was still inside a for Loop right so it's going to go through all the cool calls so I'm going to get each one of the action or which part which is officially the action part of the function right click function call and I'm going to go ahead and get the ID so I'm going to say this so I'm getting the pool caller ID in this case we call it when this case is actually it's just a function
 the function function calling right say out put this is going to be the output that comes from our get news so what I'm going to do well I already have this final stringy so that's what I'm going to pood here so it's a final strength like that they're good now these two outputs is very important as you can see
a little bit here so now they're half out two outputs with stuff that means each time I go through is going to go and get all of the tools and it gets you just one function you can have all the tools we doing call out function College are going to go ahead and get the action ID and get to the final screen which is what we get from our output when we call the actual function the actual tool this is our next order do I must go ahead and print something here so we see what's happening once I submitted
 outputs back to the assistant that's what we'll do next right here so now before I do that actually I'm going to say something like else was inside of if statement of the function name is getting noodles right so if anything else happened to raise value error and they can just say something like that string year unknown funk
and then I just put the funk name a section just to save ourselves from a lot of pictures so I'm going to get out of our if
 or for Loop that is here but all of that has to be inside of a fruit loop and now I'm going to say some meeting outputs back to the assistant so what we'll do next is this is the beauty what's a self client better and then threads and runs and submit tool so there is such a function or such an so they're such function call Sydney tools output or to Output that's why we were doing all of it but now we have to pass along a few things in order for the run in this case here to be able to go and get the tools together this point is saying we need some tools right tools required write in order for that to happen then we need to pass if you think it needs to know about the threat ID which we can get
from our thread. ID right it is snow about to run ID all right so let her know about self that run a tidy you also need to know about the tools outputs and where do we get those well 2 outputs which is exactly what we've been working on
 around here I don't have to go out with will have to call ID and has to be exactly like they scored that is what's required and action ID we're passing for the colic breakthrough have here to call ID which needs to pass exactly like this in this dictionary and it's going to be actually D&L pool is going to be the final spring which is exactly what we have here which is the information coming from our get news very cool air cool right now indeed if we go back to where we were calling this this will make more sense than what I'm used to pass that at all
nor do I need to pass that lets see what do I need to pass so now this makes sense that means now when status is required when status is requires action we are going to call it required funds which is what we just did it so it's going to go through and go and get all the tools in case you just going to go ahead and say okay so we need to function in this case but because it could be more than one function cuz it's the tool itself go through all the process to make sure the function name is exactly the name that we created at the top of the Strode you and then we get output from that function with those results are needed right
 for the ride it to process everything and what do all these great work and then we make sure that things submit those tools as you see here
 gate to our runs has been tool function you need to pass the thread ID as well as 180 always right very cool all right so there we go that is exactly what
I'm here now we should be able to have everything that we need to get things going but before we go that we need to pass something else here says here required actions so we need to pass the required action here what do we how do we do that well it's going to be unless they required actions and it's going to be run status that require action
 submit
 Bob tool outputs
 and I'm going to say. Model same model dump like that it's essentially we are just getting the submittal tools and of course we are going to go ahead and generating this case and of course we going to make it so that it is indeed a model. I'm so great a python dictionary which is needed so that the call recorder function knows how to read all of that stuff which is needed that is needed for the function calling to actual work
okay so what I want you to do is to if this and I'm making a lot of sense it's okay we watch this part if you times until you understand it the main thing to keep in mind here is that all of that he's been called inside of a wait for completed for that's where all the action is and we are setting up or we are listening light looking for the status if it's complete it then we just we go ahead and process message in cases which is this case here where it started says requires action that's when we call it required for entrance right because this again I'll repeat myself I know but I want you to understand this is where all the getting the function name getting divided he's the actual ID and everything and actual calling our function as a tool this is where everything happens in Spartan portent to make sure that we get the arguments and past the actual arguments which are passed along when we call that function which would
we get news and make sure the functioning is getting there and everything is good and life is great right so that's very important to keep in mind now I know it was a little bit of working that needed to be done but that's how you do function calling you with the assistance API next we are going to create yet another function here or Methodist should call because it's inside of a class this is going to be for Streamlight and we're going to talk about that in a little bit. This is going to be our front and right
 say here for Streamlight so it's essentially we're going to be fine if method here called get summary by self and all it will do is this is going to go ahead and return
 self that summary a section that's all this function is doing here it's going to be more apparent once we are putting together the front and widths
the next method we going to create here is the run method run the steps
 find this run steps
 reference self anniversary run steps
 self-taught client
 go to threads runs and steps of such and passing the list and was seen this before so we are going to force go through the 1 stops and get all that information for that we need to pass the thread ID as you know so thread self course
 get the ID as well as the Run ID so it's going to be self
 Bryant ID
 her good and so we got to go
screen print this case last ring saver on steps
 and I send our run steps so we can see what's going on this just for us
 okay so I think these are all the methods that we need
 we have a few here so we how we have to call the required functions I have to process message will have the Run assistant these are very important visit allow a structural create assistance which is the most important thing really and add to thread before that we have to create thread and quit assistant at which was this this was
 run assistant course to run assistant and would have to create a system this is what I want to talk about and Lala so we have our class here assistant manager which we can essentiate as an object and we going to be able to run and create assistance and do all the things that we've done before
I need to print more object-oriented way of doing things and most importantly that we know that you needed to get news which we tested earlier here this is a tool that's going to be using in the process in the function calling tool as we discussed so very exciting okay so now I think it's time for us to test this out so let me move this Maine
 to the bottom
 what about you
 if so I'm going to comment at this
 it's coming this out as well as that
 of course for testing and first of all we are going to go ahead and say a manager create a veritable manager and then it stinks that I would see stint manager by such very clean and what we'll do next is we are going to be using string light which will allow us to create a web page where we can actually see things happen
the first symbol of course I'm going to come here and go to requirements and I want to go ahead and let such make sure that I run again pimp and stole our request requirements a text so we can pull in this extremely package okay so looks like we've gotten everything let's make sure she'll be fine with C streamlet is there that's very exciting real good so they're cleared of this and now I can go ahead and we can now use scream like you don't know what's wrong with it is again it's just a very simple framework that you can use a python from one who can use to quickly generate web pages with B. It's really beautiful creative streamlet interface so I can actually create a user interface of course that's what it does I'm going to use a Streamlight first of all I need to go ahead and import
as st4 streamlet so now I can set things up here I'm going to start by putting the title so St. Title
 going to be news
 summarizer and then I'm going to adhere a form which will allow us to end its field where we can in this case add Laura can type where users can type in the topic so I'm going to say with st. Form and for any form we need to pass a key to his mother's Ghost Call of user input
 farm and then I'm going to pass the instructions here but Asti that text area so can actually create a text area or text in putting the Seas text area cuz it's cool and I'm going to say what I want the text to show here going to be enter topic maybe take Sarah's too much let's just say
that's text or put probably better alright
 and I'm going to also create a submit button such a nasty thought forms submit button when I pass a label which is not do justice screen with run
 assistant now we need to be able to handle the button let me see something here I'm going to run this real quick just to see if something's going to happen in order for us to run a streamlet application we no longer say python we say streamlet run and then the name of the
 file all is well what will happen a new window is going to open OK Google can see I have an open now it looks really nice and use the Riser or something and I'll have to buy me hair so just like that were able to create a user interface that looks wonderful
let's go ahead and handle this big button because you want once this has been button is click something is to happen I'm going to say if submit button
 case I will handle submit when I go ahead and create an assistant and thread if they don't exist so I'm going to call the manager
 is we in Spanish rated here and I'm going to say.
 Create assistant look how beautiful this is now we can just go ahead and call those methods write the function this case from our manager object class that we created and for that we need to pack a few things in my past that name
 the name is going to be news summarizer
 such and then I'm going to pass instructions and I already have those instructions I'm just going to copy and add them here so that way we don't have to do all of this
 Jesus actually says here your personal article summarizer assistant who knows how to tie
list of Articles title and description and then write a short summary of all the news articles about the most important thing here is that we need to pass the tools list right so the list is going to go in as an object or a dictionary in this case and we need to pass a few things here so now I have all of that already and you have access to all of that this is the dictionary that you need to pass in for our function calling to work things out of the tools you say this so have a type is going to be function the function we going to get in the name is getting use remember has to be the same name of the function we created earlier get music very important and then description can a description here
 for the function would have the parameters and it would have the parameters and and then have it for a field which is an object or dictionary it's going to be object the property and importantly notice here at the property
the topic this is the argument write the topic is going to be type of string and we need to pay the description of that property which is topic remember we adding topic because that was the are we passing has to be exactly the same name is very important otherwise he's not going to work until we pass the description new topic for the news for example been calling and so forth no important part here he's a hired cuz this going to be the argument primer as you see this part of grammar and that is required which is going to be the topic notice these are the same names as the arguments were promised we passed the function
 so when you click the button then we're going to create an assistant and then also we are going to go ahead and create right below that going to go ahead and create the actual thread because that is needed right to Cracker bread can you use manager again and then you poke function the function or call the function create thread for half past
next we going to go ahead and add the message and run the assistant that such how do you like well we're going to use manager again this is the beauty of having that class right and a cold add message to thread function and I'm here when did pass the roll the roll is going to be user content it's going to be I'm going to passing as a hamstring so I'm going to copy
 what I have here already so it's easier cuz of content says summarize the news on this topic
 and passing the instructions know where is this instruction coming from well this is the instructions we getting from the text input very good wants me to added that message this is going to be a message to death red light what we need to do then is just say manager
 that run assistant right that method and passing the instructions
which is going to be summarized that news and you can be my library for that's okay
 and once we have that then we are going to wait for completion
 and process then the messages okay so I'm going to call manager again say we wait for completed so wait for completed it should be wait for completion so I ready so we have that so
 change that so that wait for completion and then we're going to have a summer here which is going to be we said I'm going to call the manager. Get summary for this point we should have a summary and once we have this summary we can then say iced tea for swim lit and write that summary okay
 into our page and then St again I'm going to add it
text here which is going to be the Run stats
 and then I'm a hasty. Code so this is just going to show they want steps at the bottom and then I'm going to pass to call the manager that run steps function which we created by cuz I just go ahead and show all the steps and it won this line numbers to be true as such. It so we are now calling everything for us while we created the assistant make sure that we passed the tools which is going to be a function function calling to Lee sexually and then we create the thread that's needed and then once at Freddy's created we creating space add Macaulay add message to thread and the user and the summarize news on this topic with slime instructions right and I'm going to run the assistant pastor instructions when a wait for completion right few seconds and then we get the summary
Cricket summary and then you write a summary into our
 into our page and then of course we also got to the steps so we can show the bottom that's it so now if I save this go ahead and run again thank you go back and always everyone let's go ahead and say open a i
 and run
 break so after the woman's he can see that we have here here are some recent news articles about open the eye and goes and gets the title how to stop another open night meltdown and it's got all the main points the author's Source description so what happens now in the bank and get season was able to go and create this all of this description has a little summary sheet the same thing with wired so everything is related to description here is indeed showing a note saying none here
maybe perhaps any code I put something wrong but that's okay we can look at that a little bit later so I can see if this is indeed working and we go back to our command line here or terminal I should say there's a lot stacked has shown up here and let's see so we can see here in one of the finest artists have the assistant ID someone a copy that assistant ID and go back to our code and for I see some ID here I'm going to actually taste that in and let's go ahead and find the thread
 ID and then we go to thread ID it's just copy this
 and I'm going to put there so this is what we going to be using for a while so that means then I'm going to go ahead and stop of this all together because now I'm going to change gears to make sure that we don't recreate the same we don't create yet another anniversary
when if we were to run this in this case adding another something else so I stopped that and this is stopped now if you go to
 openai let's go to our assistance we should see that indeed would have this new summarizer assistance with that idea which is the same idea that we just added a hard-coded to make sure that everything works as intended
 okay so now that we have actually added this thread ID as well as a citizen's ID we have this code so that it will check if there's already an assistant i d k if there is an assistant lady we just going to go in and retrieve that assistant right say assistant better system and retrieve same thing with the Fred that's who this is why we had this phone before so now if I save this
and live on again
 Beer Fest so this time here I'm going to run again List have a different topic to say us
 inflation
 go ahead and run it will take a few moments and they have it here are some recent news articles about US inflation and have the title the author and everything and we do have that description is really nice and Waltz have read more the homelessness in the US hit record high and all of this information very good so we still getting none for steps here I can look at the code just to make sure because for steps I saw it earlier that we should be getting something but think i a c
 can have run steps that's what your code
81 steps
 I'm just run steps self list right imprinting the Run steps and I shooed
 return that's why I run steps like this what a second move
 this there so this actually works I can actually save this and I'm going to probe in into Data so I can get the right information
 so now if I go back here
 and I'm going to say always be run or just remind him one time that's okay and I'm going to find something else like say the say apple can you have two little bitty can see that the indeed this is running your some recent news articles about Apple
Apple pay Apple card Apple Visa TV and all this great stuff so you can see and of course we have all the Run steps which is exactly 12 and this is just for us to the bag of course in a final project or product you shouldn't be probably shouldn't have his there if I just want to show you so we have this is working if we go to our assistance will see that we don't have duplicates of a system we just have one summarizer because now we're able to get the assistant ID and of course we printed out the Friday so we using those for our assistant API that we eating creating here to summarize our news very cool so I hope this is making sense I hope you are seen the power of using function calling with assistance at the eye and it's part of adding more tools to Tool kits of an assistant is able to run
information x-ray formation from somewhere else as you can see we're tapping into a totally different thing for us a total different system API in this case to get information and pass that back through the large language model is his to model that we using large language model that we using here gpt-3 we instructed it to create a summary get that information to summarize everything and then pass it back to the thread as the response and that's what we getting here and you can see a lot of different use cases that can come up from this right and create for his newsletter application that what he would do is depending on the topic that you pass in here you will just create and generate a newsletter with the main points about that topic so things you can do are literally endless there's so many things you can do with his and I hope you are seeing the power that we have here. All of this is just using
assistance Avi okay so so far we've done a lot of things in the last thing we did was to create this summarizer new summarizer with which allows us to look into a passing tools passing function calls to our assistant that way we can extend even more the two lanes are we can pass the next to our assistant to do something else has quesadilla sister now has a dysfunction call we just looked at one function called when you can have many function calls and this is very important because that I just said will extend the capability of our model is not only can we rely only on what the large language model knows now we can include out of tools and so that dularge language model tomorrow in this case I have some more context more knowledge base so that's what's all about so it gives us that flexibility and what I want you to do is to think about the use cases that you can Implement are your work or May
the Project's what else can you do the example that I showed you here was tapping into a calling in this case in a p I use API but you could tap into a database for instance in order to alter things so they did is that now you have the capability and you see how function calling is really awesome when you come to creating really powerful assistance so that's what I will do is we going to look at a knowledge base retrieval tool cuz now we're going to look at how to even give more context more knowledge specific knowledge that we would want to our model so that our assistant is able to have the knowledge to answer certain questions and get us the results that we want what we going to be building is what I call a steady body sexually while I was to upload certain PDF files and then we can type and questions in a chat bot and get answers pertaining to that to those document
I talked to me that we have uploaded but before we do that let's talk a little bit about the back ground of how things work how this retrieval Thing Really Works like in the back at it so how does it work this knowledge with people the way it works is if you look at is we have documents documents can be whatever we owe upload in this case listing of it as just a PDF file so what happens now is that we passed that all we upload that to open a.i. large language model which has this language has this massive knowledge base but when we pass these documents in that means those documents and files are no part of these large language model knowledge base that's the whole idea so that way when we query or we ask questions to the model which now
 understands more than what it knows because we've passed more knowledge for sake then we can get the answers so
this is what we have in a nutshell but there's a lot of things that are happening internally hear what other things is if you look
 inside right so what happens now is that we're taking a document and we put it through a document splitting process space of the documents or split it up into smaller chunks and then those are actually saved in what we call a vector store now this is what generally happens when we talked about what we talked about pushing information in this case documents and so forth to dularge language model so it has more context has more knowledge okay so the question here is okay what is his back door store and why he's not even important the thing to keep in mind here is that even Vector store the representation of document is not it's not the same as we started with so this is not even documents junk this is not even a document that
when I can read anymore now we have this different representation I recall and bangs so what happens that affect our store clothes and bedding some bedding is a vector just a mathematical representation of the text of those documents and that is indeed what is put inside of the vector store if a story is just a database that holds all of these mathematical representation of our document now the reason why embeddings were so important is because embeddings our first of all our mathematical representation which means it's really easy for all the reasons to be able in this case a to search for whatever it's looking for for the text for the meaning and so forth so there's a lot more to that but that is De Dia look for pieces of text Skippy caltex Burger on Mississippi text there must battle for the day shift now it's easy to look for the pieces of texts and trying to fight
similarities between those pieces of texts which are now in batting's ddso visually again this is what happened so you have all the documents from putting different kind of documents but right now we're talking about yesterday at 5 but could be anything really in general okay and is that has to be transformed into inviting us to just say which are these mathematical representation of those pieces of data text with a document which we call the factor representation and that is what is pushed into this massive algorithm that will then know how to do the similarity search to find the right result for sale so the query the questions also have to be transformed into things so that they are able to be understood and be searched for because if the information I was in the vector representation for math makes sense that the answer or if either the question the quality has to be
a format that way if the algorithm is able to do the searching in the factory store and supporters and get the right information and of course that gives us the result so this is what how it looks like I can't take it we have the factory store loading so this is not necessarily just what happens with open a.i. this case and we talked about it but I'm talking about in general this is what would happen so in this case he would have the document to loading to what happens then we split everything and then all this pleadings those are the vector representation of our documents here they put into a storage and Becker store not the retrieval in this case everything is going to be next right so now we have a question or a query we go through the vector store the retriever so we retrieve the relevance place because the information now it's into is in this different format and now at least search happens to find what
goes with what what makes more sense right to find the most similar pieces of data so that we understand what's going on and then once that is retrieved the most similar pieces of that that's what it's been put into a prompt right so we have a prompt macquarrie and we have that what we've received from the retrieval the documents were splitting everything and with the prompt and with the help of the large light with model in this case Tractor Model that's when we get the answer to this is my friends and this is how it works in the back and now if we go ahead and look back at the first the opening I noticed that in this case open I simplifies everything for us when it comes to this whole process because now we have some sort of like a black box where all of the things that I've just told you now it's happening all have to be concerned about Easter get a document push them into this black box for say and then
start conversing with our large Lima tomorrow in this case our model Missy's in the form of our assistance maybe I so this is what we going to be doing next next we're going to learn how to do knowledge retrieval by pushing or buy a floating the files this case documents to our assistance API and then be able to ask questions about those documents so I went ahead and created a new project called study buddy and I set up the environment environment variables and everything
 and I also have requirements.txt we have all these but see we don't need requests anymore I don't think that's okay so it's go ahead and run pipe install real quick care
 our request so we can get all those dependencies all right so we got all this dependencies is very good and what we'll do next let's get rid of that you know app here everything should be
looking good nothing new I've got a few Imports as well as some of them are not going to use them that's okay we can get rid of them when we need to get one thing I notice I exchanged here is not decide now for a model we have g44 1106 preview no remember these could change depending on when you watching this can go to the eye doctor mutations and see that they should work so the first thing to do is to his how do we upload files to the assistance API in the back end so let's put number one here I blowed
 if I file to open
 hey I am betting special that's what we doing weddings yes okay so to do so first of all we need to get those files and I already have that prepared for crisis so I'm going to go ahead and get it the one file at least which is going to be in this case this is the undersea
cryptocurrency is very short. Nothing too large that's okay and we're going to use that and upload that to the embeddings the opening I am getting sick so I'm going to say 5 pack
 create a file path here and because it's literally here so what are we going to do it just going to go ahead and say I got a forward slash and of course make sure that you know depending on what operating system are on so this is how we do in on Mac so I know it's cryptocurrencies I'm going to scrape to currency that PDF that's the names of the trade name is exactly the same and then I'm going to create an actual file object and I'm going to say client right better
 and it would have files client files not bad at which is good so and then let's say I'm going to create
and we're past the filed when I say open and then find a pasta file file path
 such and my CR-V and we need to also pass the purpose why we are uploading this in this case was going to say that purpose is going to be equal to assistance assistance like that
 okay there we go so now we have 14 describes new new line doesn't work so now we've created the actual file object which is going to be pushed into the open-air I am betting in this case the open AI assistants in Pediatrics and then step
 number 24 symbol he is we going to create an assistant done this many time so you should know how to do this now so I'm going to just go ahead and do it anyway so it's Easter
I'm going to use her client going to have to do better for now assistants that create and have to pass a few things first of all is going to be named going to call this study buddy
 and then instructions and I have the instructions here so I'm not going to bore you so can I just get all of that and show you here okay so I do have these fractions here you are helpful study assistance who knows a lot about understanding research papers you were always to summarize papers and do all these things we going to have access to all day so there's no need for me to go through it but it's important to remember that whenever he created these instructions these are the prom so you need to be very thoughtful and very specific of what you want his assistants to be able to do the next 14 thing here is tools at the tools we going to have to pass here or essentially simple impastor S1 too old and the
type of this tool I'm going to say is going to be a retrieval would you want to be able to upload a file file
 okay, see you tomorrow in this case in the same model as the model that we created at a top and then we need to pass also file IDs noticed it says IDs that I D that means we can pass more than one file and that's why we have a list here so I'm just going to go and see the file object. I d like this and this file object can remember that's what we created here and for reasons that you know by now I'm just going to go ahead and
 get the Asus
 ID so we can use at the ladder later so I'm going to say Isis ID when I use the assistant and get to the ID
 I'd like to print that one
 my sis ID and then I'm going to just to pay some of the code here this is for later once we've run once we have
how do you thread a D in a society then we can add them here Caesar old ones and they're not going to work so for now just going to go ahead and make them a such so and I can also go ahead and go like this for now and next I'm going to go ahead and create and step three
 would create a thread again nothing new here same thing so first of all I'm going to create a message here and for them is going to say what is my name something like that that's okay so they can go ahead and create a thread here so thread just client bad hour
 threads and we'll just go ahead and create
 write me no need to pass anything and let's go ahead and get to this thread ID right away and ID that's why I didn't print
 Grenada lights like that
say run
 the assistant
 so how much they run
 client
 friends runs create
 can we need to pass the thread ID so it's going to be thread
 IDs search and
 assist assist ID and instructions I can just put something here that says please
 address the user as bond has Bruce I'm also going to go ahead and pull in this wait for run completion with seen this before so no need for me to go through ideas. He's going to go ahead and wait for a few moments make sure that everything is running and then he's going to give me the time I provided elapsed time to say how long it took you to run and everything we've seen this before
that's what I'm going to be using the force to run right through our to run it so now I'm going to go ahead and say run it how do we do that and I say wait completion and then I'm going to pass the client who's going to be our client and was passed the thread ID so the thread ID and let's pass the Run i.d. it's going to be run. I d i s k could we have the run here and of course if you want you can check do you want steps logs and this was seen that before so so very simple let's go ahead and run this most importantly will know hopefully that we going to be able to push this cryptocurrency PDF file into open I am betting songs Bryce is going to go and do all the things that I showed you before what happened to the backhand
 and we should have an assistant let's go ahead and run this real quick
all goes well we should be able to go something to say
 python
 3
 start and run so we got some things here but let's go ahead first and get the assistant ID so we copy that and I did hear let's get to the thread ID
 and put it here so that next time we can run things differently so let's go to open the I hear the assistants the back and let's see if this actually worked I'll go ahead and refresh here we should see that we have a study buddy this is our new assistant there is the ID and everything is good if I click of course we have all that information and the model that is using and most importantly we see that the retrieval is ticked as well as the creeper currency PDF file was uploaded this is real great we knew this would happen of course but it's always nice
most importantly says assistance response to document understanding Court, received by the University of Kentucky Boulevard to go through all the things really and does a summary of the everything okay which is good and also have the Run steps and while I so nothing new you would have seen but most importantly we know that things are working because we got the document I uploaded and is he's part of the knowledge base now close this and now that we have the IDS right so we don't have to go back and if we create the same assistant we going to hard-code them here this is just for testing purposes and now we no longer need to create this I'm going to go ahead and come in this out as well as comment this out
 and what else I'm going to come into this out also
 cuz we don't need that so now before we run I can then create the actual message from the same message
single client data threads
 messages and I'm going to create a message which means I have to pass the thread ID password ID right and the role is going to be user
 and content. This is where we pass her message which is the query for say what is my name okay so now you should get an answer of what is mining because we have added APUSH dieterle meding's my D file in history PDF file about crib cryptocurrency should know how to answer to that I'm going to save this make sure everything is good
 okay so everything seems to be great let's go ahead and run again
 so that means now we should be able to see the answer for tanning to what is my name
 so he's going to go and
get a look at the document we offloaded and answer according to that document so I ceased intrusive response mining is a process through which can be obtained it involves the creation of blocks and love a lot and everything he tells us that this was actually able to get the information from that PDF file which is wonderful so this is working. It's very simple if you go back to the code here you can see we still have one hopefully just one cuz we didn't repeat things right to have study body and everything is there and I clicked it should have still the file and I can upload as many files as I want or we'll get there but the basics is here so you able to see how to get this case retrieval the knowledge retrieval how to get this to work by uploading and file a PDF file to enhance the knowledge base for our assistance if he I
they have it now that we know how to upload files and Converse or say ask questions about that file is kcp a father uploaded from conjunction with how I see it is time for us to do something little bit cooler which is to build our study B stadia is when I blow it in the file the monorail Florida now and maybe another file and then start chatting and asking questions about those files with those PDF files documents let's go ahead and do that so what I'm going to do here I'm going to create yet another file to differentiate a few things somewhere the main that pie p y and the depreciation is going to be I would take me to more so why me
 get all of these code for the app file and pass it over
 so have everything here at sea
and I still need to get the IDS because we need them a copy that
 and put them here
 and in this case we don't want or need that so let's just go to the bat all together
 all right now because of the nature of this application this is going to be a streamlined application to do a few things that we need to do to set everything up so the first thing I'm going to put it here is the nature of scream late is that we need to make sure that we have sections in Italian mean you hit a gnarled click a button in extremely application where it happens that eats going to go ahead and reload the entire obligation entire field in her window which is not what we want it soaked up I'm not going to go into this whole section thing with tremlett just this is going to help us specially when we want to create that this track by using strings
and the great thing all serve ice cream late is that all of that is included so there is actually a chat Forum that we can create quickly with Streamlight that's why I strongly is pretty cool okay so first I'm going to go ahead and initialize all the sections that we need okay so I'm going to start by putting a statement here if file underscored ID list of this is going to hold all of the file IDs could potentially we can upload more than one file and not in SD that section State that's the case then we're going to create at session
 second stage. File IDs listing that's going to be just an empty list and just have to do this and I'm going to do another one as well so if start
 cat was going to be part of the button really not in St. Section
state is the section that start
 not that I just say is going to be false
 what else now let me use the thread thread ID not in
 section State then I'm going to say a study session state
 got bread. Those are the sections went to set up okay we got to go straight and start setting up the front end in this case the page so I'm going to go ahead and just say set up our front and page
 and to do so with family is extremely simple or say iced tea and then set there's a function called set page config
 and here we can pass a few things so I'm going to say page titled say study buddy
chat and learn that sounds very good and Paige icon we can actually pass Nikon here like this looks okay so we just put this is what the icon of presentation of a stack of books this is where I'm going to start our function definitions Etc Fleet this is where the fun will start so the first thing we need to do is to figure out a way to upload a file to open the eye which we know how to do that so I'm going to go in Define
 the upload AI so we need to get file path and I'm going to go ahead and do that we've seen that before with open and refined file past the file path then cigar be
 anime eyes file and unless they respond
going to go get the client files
 create and the nasty file which is going to be just the file that we have here we got here right and then I'm going to get the path or read actually didn't come in this cuz I wanted to come in as B paste dream really all right
 and then of course never passed the purpose and what I want to happen for this function is I want to return the actual ID so I'm going to say a response at ID so this will return it the idea of the file that was about it very simple and next role do here we're going to create a sidebar okay this side
 bar that where users can upload files so here we are safe I'll upload them go to put that in a funk or no
I'm going to put that in a variable because we want access to that so file upload and to generate a sidebar in the streamlet can the fairy very simple Sushi sasti sidebar such and I'm going to say. File uploader cuz we want actually sidebars fly a sidebar with a 5-mile app loader and we can pass some taxes I upload a file to be
 transformed into embeddings in a real application obviously probably going to want to talk if I'm betting squeeze a most users won't even care but it's okay we here and then I need to pass here a key to say something file upload and that's that
 now we can also add a button that says one click and they can actually upload a file okay so this is going to be just the interface
can I put a file right drop a file and then we need to allow them to click to say I actually want to upload the file that we just dropped here I blowed file button and we can also store the file ID so much and this is going to be up to load file and you got this will make sense when she first thing of things but I hope you're seeing you the Pieces come together I'm going to see if this case File uploaded it should be file uploaded
 if there's something there file
 say I bloated
 we got to go ahead and open
 file uploaded in this case and cats
name and this should probably be a string and we need to pass that we you want to say here we want to
 write this as a binary that's why I'm going to say a w b
 Freedom Writers binary Arby's read as a binary as we saw earlier here and all of that as F and an RCF that right the right to that file uploaded okay and I want to see get to buffer and in this case here there times when also we want to allow users to upload more than one file song I just say something like maybe another file ID
 and I'm going to say I bloated
 let's say I have to load
call the upload to open the eye
 and then put a nap string here and this past the file uploaded and get the name I such in this make sure that we would take care of the section so the session State file I do list seafile and Friday that list doesn't give me intellisense that's okay and I'm going through a hand receipt for a lady list Square have that file idealists file ID since before my ID or can we go
 and when I penned our another file ID my section and I steam wooden crate that side bar and write something to do to it which is going to be a file ID
 and then when they pass the another file idea such a so
actually we just writing on the wall or on the side of our didot other file at either was at its sweet time without your file and then we can see all those IDs okay so what I want to do next is I want to hot display
 those file IDs
 so I'm going to make sure I can look at the section State file
 ID list if that's all good then we're go to sidebar and write this case
 uploaded
 file IDs this is where we actually showing the things really and then the bottom is a 4
 file ID and St. Session file make sure I get the right
 list it was going to be a list with all this file IDs
that happened actually being uploaded and I'm going to write into the sidebar again
 and I'm going past e-file ID now once we have these file IDs we need to associate them to the current assistant that's very important was each assistant can have multiple files. So how do we associate them some of that right here associate each file ID with the
 current assistant file really and say client and assistance X-Files and I'm going to go and create to create a file as you know by now we've passed the assistance ID which we can get to buy say yes cyst ID right assist ID and then we need the file ID which is going to be fun
i d
 I do have that too so that's how we associate that each file in Riyadh is going to be Associated to the correct assistant okay
 next we are going to go ahead and save button to initiate the chat session okay I'm getting there okay so I'm putting these things so you noticed that in streamlet to start in this case to initiate something at Handler write a button click handle Handler so you say St put in if St. Sidebar
 that button and I can say
 start chatting and this is where we handle of the click okay so first we need to make sure that all the files have been uploaded that's very important so that we can check that but
go to section State and then file id id list make sure that we have that section which means we have some and then we're going to make sure that our session state for start chat in this case is going to be true because that means we have everything set up for things to do the get going because we've just clicked so that means we have the file ID session going to have IDs that means then the session for the starch at that be true at this point so now we're going to create
 and you
 Fred we could create a new friend oh can you go ahead and use the same thread that's okay we're just going to go to create a new thread for this chat session okay okay so again nothing you just know how to create a thread so I'm going to call this chat thread and so I'm going to say client or
client for betta threads and create a threat okay now we have that thread set the session again Red Thread this is very important to a lot of section for the reason I said so that's just how extreme leg works and section State and I'm going to use the thread ID and I'm going to pass the our chat thread that I did so now we have set the section for this whole thing the third ID section to the thread ID of this newly-created Fred
 okay I'm going to write something to the wall all right so I'm going to say
 Fred ID
 and when I passed the chat
 got ID
 got bread that I D if statement here
that's and we'll stay on click and then else if none of that is true going to go ahead and just say something
 St. Sidebar that warning warning so it's going to be an issue and I can just say something no files found
 please upload pay at least
 one file to get started
 Target so making real progress here so one thing he wants you to keep in mind is that as we pass these documents to the embedding to open the I am bearings so we are able to catch all that information to enhance and they call it the model so we can converse or chat with it whatever comes when we ask a question when it becomes there was
response it also has other metadata such as citations okay to say okay this information that I got it from this place in a document now we have a very simple. But you can imagine you have a large document then this could be very helpful and so what I'm going to do here just an interest of time I'm going to paste in a helper function and that will essentially process message with citations Continental taste from the message and for my citations as a footnote goes through gets the content that we get four as a response right and then that and goes through and looks for certain annotation looks for certain attributes in that message if they hold payload at work we see annotations and if he sees notations of course it creates those out of patience goes through quit that are tations
so far so now there's some limitations because we said that we can pass Deacon files which we'll see but in this case here for retrieving decided files we going to do things I was going to use some dummy way with a mediator to get that going and I'm hard coating here just as for testing purposes I hope it by the time at some point once if it is assistant API is mature we have ways to do something such as
 such as calling the cited files details instead of us having to do all of this case open this is just to give you some ideas now again this is not perfect code it just works for what we trying to do here to give some ideas okay so in this case here for the file name cited file we are putting this case the creeper currency PDF right hardcore like a not a good idea but that's what we're doing anyway so that's what I'm doing
and then we have hand we have decided tations
 let's hear and eyes all of that is happening we're trading all those invitations and it will painting all of them so that everything is set up so that's what we do and after that we create a foot note in front of us a full response and we got information we put all together and then broke returning that so that is essentially what we doing in this process message with citations let's go ahead and continue putting together the front and the API or I should say the the page itself something to save the so here is where I'm going to put the main interface so we can actually see things
 so many you scream like again and I'm going to add a title for a page collie study body
 there's no such a difference here I'm adding the title before we adding the title
to the page configuration which is the other two different things and you want to learn more about string light switch I encourage you to do we can just Google real quick Ostrom Lake and then go to documentation it is the most simplest straightforward way to create prototype applications okay that's very good in Python and I'm going to also lesti stream live here I'm going to write something we are kind of like is some Hatter and I can say learn fast by chatting with your documents good for my I guess okay next we are going to again check a few things check sessions to make sure everything is good so we can proceed so first me to check that the chat was not already in section so to do so going to say if St
 go to sessions that chat
 oh start
Chad
 and if there is sickness session so if there is a chat section that means things have started so now I'm going to go initialise them and now we're going to go ahead and now we're going to go ahead and in the initialize our model so I'm going to say if openai
 model
 writing session
 let's say St. Section State opening I
 model I'm going to just say this is going to be the tragic beauty or GPT
 for like that so we using the preview and that's the only thing that actually works with what we're trying to do if you try to do Jeepers T3 turbo 3.5 to avoid cycling to work
and also going to check messages
 not in SD session state
 and I'm going to say station State messages said that to empty so this is going to help us of course with the bot with the chatbot all right so then go ahead and show existing messages if any so four messages
 NST that session
 my messages
 and I'm going to now invoke the chat notice that this chat this is what we talked about noticed as a said we don't have to do anything really when it comes to creating a chat or chat box for sake Streamlight has that so I can say.
chat is part of the framework so I can go ahead and say chat message all right looking at and we're passing the message
 or message in this case and get the roll
 how to change to message singular
 and then we going to go ahead and add that and then we're going to ride to the content inside of a markdown okay so I'm going to say a message
 and get content of that message
 so now we're putting together the actual chat in this will make a lot of sense must be surrounding this I apologize lot of code but believe me this is going to work well with holding okay so now we're going to chat the user
 so now we're going to go ahead and write
now we're going to go ahead and say chat input for the user so this is where they going to add something to as a prompt so they say if prompt
 this case has teeth a chat prompt look at that we have checking pool doesn't call it that's the beauty of streamlet I'm going to say what's new that's going to be the first thing they will see so what's new
 all right
 which allowed him to then add the user so next I'm going to go ahead and add user message to the state and display on the screen so when I put section
 messages and I went up and in this case of my passing as a dictionary so first of all do a roll
 and user
you deserve for troll and then for the content that's where we going to pass the actual prompt we going to say chat messages or message
 and this is we're going to show that this is the part where the user so we have the user so this is the user chat message
 and we're going to ride to that I'm using it marked down and we're going to pass that prompt so now we're going to go ahead and add
 the users
 message to the existing
 cred
 how do we do that why would I use client or better and go to the threads and messages and appreciate that message and how do we get or what is this matter what we needed to create a message I need a thread ID so I'm going to go through our section again
what's driving everything
 and go get it right get it right and we need to roll this case going to be user
 and the content is going to be
 our message
 actually it's going to be our prompt light to create that message very good okay we getting there next weekend to create
 create and run
 create a run with additional
 instructions nothing new here
 grants runs and create
 need to pass the thread ID so I'm going to go with go to
session States again
 get a thread ID
 and then assistant ID
 pasty Asus ID
 and then we're passing instructions
 happy instructions
 how do you spell actions
 and then was past the instructions which I have here so please answer the questions using the knowledge provided in the files when adding additional information make sure to distinguish it with bold or underline text was you supposed likely they want to do that but it's okay just to make sure we can distinguish things so next what I want to do is I want to be able to show a spinner as all of this process is happening before we get it back responses so that's good user interface
 addition
 show show a spinner
 wow the assistant
is thinking
 fixing to see with spinners spinner
 and Sky say wait
 generating response such
 and then inside here I'm going to put a while loop so I'm going to look at the run right so status would have done was done this differently before but that's okay I can just go straight here status if it's not
 completed
 then we're going to sleep for
 one second
 and then run
 run client better threads runs and retrieve so when I retrieve in this case our runs
Cassidy thread ID which we know we need to get from the session
 second stage and get the thread ID
 and then passed the Run ID which we can get that from just run that I D
 okay I'm outside the while we are going to land retrieve
 messages added by TSC student
 what's a message or messages in this case is a client
 guess what the threats would ask where all messages are and messages and go to list and courts we need to pass the thread ID go again to session
 I such so now we have all the messages
and we can process all of that I'm going to process and display assist messages cuz I'm going to put everything into side of the list to make things a little easier someone say I see stunts
 messages
 for run Tang
 and I'm going to pass the message
 Kate spear important
 and when I pass a photo in them and then we can actually pass a for Loop inside here which is pretty cool or messages
 I'm actually for say message in
 okay say message
 so we passed the message first and then run another index here we going to go do it for Lube so it's for message
so
 I want to do here we have a message and then for message in
 messages
 I'm going to make sure that if message
 that run ID
 is equal to run that ID and message
 that role is also equal to assistant so it's actually just making sure the pulled all of the messages for our from our assistant into this array so that way we can then look through them for this case here I can say
 and once we have that this list this array list I can say for message and a lot of message here and then go to our assistant messages for run because it is indeed a list so I can look through it in this case here
I'm going to say. Ons and I'm going to say process message with citation this is where we using that function that help a function we created out of town and I'm going to pass message it's going to be equal to messages
 was going to be able to message with me inside of aloof so whatever we getting there
 and when that happens we are going to also set the session state
 messages and app and all those messages in so miss case
 going to create a dictionary here so for the role
 it's going to be assistant
 and again for content
 we going to pass the full response create a dictionary to add into our messages
state
 okay and then here I'm going to go ahead and get the chat message cuz we need that out to use that which is going to be the assistant
 and then we're going to add that all those responses on to the swing so I'm going to just mark down again and passed the full response and I'm going to also past and safe allow to true can't say hello to true for ice to melt if you have over its mark down here this will you can scroll down and see that the and safe allow bullion by default and HTML tags found in the body will be scalped and therefore treated as protective Behavior may be turned off by saying this argument to true
 okay so it's hard to show you everything but we are inside of if in this case to make sure that we chat input four.
so I'm going to come down here go to that level I'm going to say else if none of this is actually happening that means we can prompt
 users to start chat so we can say St and say right can just write something to say please upload at least a file to get started by clicking on the button
 sit on the
 start
 chat
 butt massage
 all right there's a lot of things here but that's okay should be all good then you can remember you will have access to this code so it's not a big deal to essentially we are creating this chat and there's a lot of sections going on here
boarding like I said because with string lights you have to make sure that the sections are all set up because swim later whenever you click a button it refreshes the entire page and that means we start from scratch so you lose all the states so we want to make sure of a state that's why we have all these states thing going on here when I learn more about that you can check out their documentation okay so we should have everything set up for us let's see if this works then go ahead and make sure that we can say stream
 grimlet Run and make sure we were running the main at the optic I don't see why
 enter
 and you can see what happens very nice user interface that was created which we came to go ahead and use so for now and let's see if this works and then go over to browse and then I'm going to go ahead and get the cryptocurrency again and
there we go we have this cryptocurrency it's there now we're going to go ahead and say upload
 it's uploading and lots of that file was indeed uploaded file ID app loaded file ID is there very good so is it true if we go back to if we go to open a.i. and let's go to refresh
 and we can actually look at the files we should hopefully see cryptocurrency one of these files I added a little bit ago is going to show us exactly the the purpose status is ready and how the size of it and of course it also defile I date you have to do there but that's okay no just go back to
 the application and list are chatting so quick to start chat and what's up I'm going to say tell me about
 data mining
let's go ahead and see what's going to happen so while I can see the way to generate a new responses working and then we have this all these was given to us by stream like that's really cool if we had to build all that I'm cells that would be pretty will take us a long time okay so now it's going to look at the cryptocurrency and look at it and make sure that it gets the information that he needs it appears there may be some confusion around the term data mining it is pretty pertains to equip the currency which they uploaded files seem to discuss this is good for the same the uploaded files seems to be sky is looking at those two files everyone I have loaded before and that's okay usually you should probably just get one there but also probably from the previous I blow that we did when we first arrived in this it's okay so in this case the remaining in the context of cryptocurrencies usual refers to the process of mining
I'm self-employed and their ego so we can say can you tell me
 how many
 crypto
 currencies are they are discussed or being discussed in the document and while I'm there we go
 okay there you go I apologize inconvenience but seems there is an issue accepting the content Darkman title Cooper PDF the pages had no confidence when I try to open it which means I cannot determine how many calories in cake that's okay at what I can do again remember this is still in bed or sometimes happen so what I can do and I'll see if I can delete one of these two perhaps maybe that's what I'm I shouldn't even be a thing anyway but sometimes it happens and sometimes it
this weird stuff so it's okay we just going to try again and this time it will work
 so now we worked so based on the search results document mention several creeper currencies including Bitcoin Litecoin I can swear call Ether
 and potential others are not named explicitly in bubble on its really good I can also ask about everything also I can go ahead and upload a different file or another file location to say I flowed hope so this is a problem now that I bought it I uploaded to files so if I refresh this is exactly what I didn't want to do I should have
 this file to still eat a few here and it's very strange because it shows all of these different files are being uploaded I'm just delete some of them some of them since I bloated bloated I'm not sure why but okay
let's go ahead and delete some of them and go back
 go back here and I'm going to browse to go get to yet another one so I have another one called lipids this is a biology file
 and that's the one I'm going to go ahead and upload high-end this sometimes doesn't work let me know fluid at 1
 take that fire was uploaded and let's see if I can upload another one Missy shoot cuz we have that ass up love this one
 okay so now we have two files that were uploaded let's go back to open the I and I'm going to refresh here
 okay so we have a few files that were uploaded but one thing I can do it and go to assistant setting this will be better and go here
 and I can see the files are uploaded wow there's a lot of files are uploaded so looks like when the first upload something they change their name
I blowed first and then they the IDS are created I think that's what's happening not sure it's her strength so it's little bit buggy but it's okay so let's see if this works so now we're going to go ahead and start to chatting
 let's talk about it we have two files then go ahead and talk about biology Atmos a what is a lipid
 okay so now should be able to go and fetch the file this case the lipid of the biology file that has information about the lipids and so forth hopefully I'll write this work so lipids are biological molecules are have limited solubility in water and soluble in nonpolar organic sold in okay so this is where it went and got the information from the documents because we have even the source and everything here that is showing very good so I can also go back and ask about
this case cryptocurrency
 what is crypto
 pixel comes here with for resources crypto section Bitcoin Litecoin and all that stuff and explained everything and very awesome day so this is actually working which is very exciting now remember these are just two examples that I buy symbol relate to Showcase how to use assistance API and so that you can take this to the next level dance to this is no production code obviously for many reasons but at least give you some of the year did everything also to remember is that the essence of the I still in beta which means they're still working on it and maybe some apis will change by the time watching this but I hope you understand at least what's happening the basics of how assistance AP at work I give you a little bit
the rundown of the vector store in wedding so how did things work in the background and how assistance if you're in so many ways allow us developers to really not think too much about what's in the background which is really exciting but also need to let you know that with that we get a lot of some disadvantages meaning that we don't have a lot of control or with all of that flexibility all of that construction will also lose a few things one of the things you will notice even though assistant API it's most likely going to get it keep getting better it's important to all to know that there are other tools that he can use that perhaps give you a little more flexibility but also that means that you have to be a little bit more work per say that to my house there's a spool called Lang chain which I'm just going to let you know about it's a wonderful framework that allows you to reassemble many other many other remodels in this case many other large language models because there's not just it
open the I catch a PT use in Japan he's there are many others as well for this framework you were able to actually see most of the things we talked about most of the things that opening or I have a check things out for us which is a good thing but are you able to see that will be able to do more in the back and in terms of choosing your own Vector stores indexing all your documents do you process that I showed you in the back and that's happening you will actually be able to see more it becomes more apparent if I may say that right so that is a different topic but just something to keep in mind and I hope this course has given you the something at least to think about some good starting points when it comes to the assistant API and you can to keep learning of course watching for the documentation guess things will change that's just a known fact and so but I hope this course was able to give you the tools that you need to at least start thinking about how to use the assistant API
to build Ultra things and I we didn't touch on the phone using the code interpreter as a tool directly really but that's something you can do as an exercise so you can create a bot I can create a tool that will analyze code in fact I think we talked a little bit as an exercise earlier but now you have the tools you know streamlet or at least you have some ideas we can use that to create a code body something like that it's right at over eight pair programming buddy or something like that that will help you divide things and go from there like something a lot of things that I can do here a lot lot of things but I just scratched the surface and I hope you enjoy this course I hope you will like the style that I used to to take this course and I hope this was useful thank you so much for your time and I'll see you next
