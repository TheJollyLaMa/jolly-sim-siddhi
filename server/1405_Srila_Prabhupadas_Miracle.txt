okay write Krishna so well it's a unique kind of holiday season for us that grows around every year right because on one day you have
 Christmas birthday
 and that you stay up till midnight and then the very next day you shall propose birthday that's how it works pretty cool that's today so we thought we would do some reading you ready for this right now yeah okay what I did was I just looked at sugar pop had Lila me to this is I don't know if I guess if you can say the authorised biography this would be the one I written by his disciples a strip basket Swami volume set there's a lot of Memoirs out there now about the people's time with pearl by but this is like a thorough biography it's big it's big and it's yeah it's not written like hey this is my time with prabhupada this isn't have it no it's like they just interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people
Delta you know of all the whole timeline of his entire life and build out a thorough biography
 so I thought it's in 65 I have the one volume Edition but it was written six volumes and each of these cuz it's also coming out now on Audible to so I really recommend this actually you know it's a it's a way where you learn who shall profit is cuz if you're reading his books everyday like we do here on the podcast it gives you a whole background and it is kind of a soft way to learn the whole philosophy in here and everything and just threw his life you know so you really learn a lot from this book can you really learn who Sheila Prophet was
 what is the easy read to it's a fun easy read adventurous a lot of testimony and sprinkled throughout it and yeah the introduction digivolve
and then that'll kind of take us like through his life when he's sure it's it's red by the old shelter drummer a Kendra on the article on the on the audible why don't I invite you to read one
 I don't know they didn't said I don't know but that might stir up in here
 how is the singer
 all right so this is volume one which is entitled to Lifetime in preparation right because he came to India as a seven-year-old that I took to America rather it was a lifetime in preparation to bring bhakti to the Western World you know before we jump into this I'm going to ask Mara Mara is probably read every proud pod biography perhaps except this one she didn't read this one but you read a lot of the other ones that are now like now coming out and I haven't I will say
but what's your favorite or name maybe a couple of your favorite of the newer ones that have come out better sort of one volume but people spend a lot of time with pro-pain rhinos is one of my favorite to send three volumes that shamisen to propose and the world's been waiting for it and it's cool it's other things you can give to a non devotee and we'll be like we are out I also like the swapmeet in a Strange Land I never read such a great rendition and then Miracle on 2nd Ave that's what kind of Mirage what about I'll build you a temple have you tried that one yet I haven't read that but I rate myself as asking Mara
 how about by his example
yeah that's fine just had it out the other day I think this Guru Das Guru. You know if you get it from Guru Das mukunda goswami stories Lucifer's probably disciples who dresses like we're in London staying and some Odd Squad or something like that with these visitors come over like a whole troop it's like
 the head of the Hell's Angels like Ken Kesey or something like that the manager of the Grateful Dead is like that is crazy you know it's like a crazy person walks in a while so what about
 I left five years and 11 months oh yeah baby I love that book 2 classic
 are you ready
say I will say to hear it from the very first people to put when the whole move it was not established yet you get some special nectar there cuz it was so it was so underground back then I mean those stories of one probably soon B students over and he'd cook for them and then he'd be the one likes cleaning up after service about like this Sunday fee stitches are Grievous which came out a long time ago which is Harry Krishna explosion that came out it was that one is that's that's like Jack Kerouac disciple that would be the one right there that's a very cool in the Harry Krishna explosion but anyway this morning I woke up laying on a Davey in the chowpatty temple in ramaswamy Temple giving her appreciation and proud pod from I don't know how many years ago it was but to hear you moan today we talked about prod pod also
live with him and he took care of her for her for a few years and so I have to listen to so I was thinking and we got to live you know it's in my book I we lived with Luna and Pat Henry's house for about 5 weeks or so and I was thinking man the nectar Henry got in those two years it must be her forget about that you never heard before and then I would invite like Melinda Mirage over cuz when I lived in DC at the time so we could Hammer I know that was a woman of not only did she have all that unique experience of proper but she herself was like a walking Saint some very deep deep spiritual
 vaishnava janato Tioga shoes
to share about example and just her own presents you know I'm convinced I'm convinced you know we were reading yesterday krishna's appearance Krishna ordered all the demigods cuz all the demigods appeal to him and and the and the demigoddesses and they all said I'm going to descend but all of your going to have to come and take Birth come with me come with me it's all the demigods took birth in the family of the art of us some is gopis some his wives of the audibles and so I feel like it's the same way it's a prophet had these people in line at that he just like I mean she she exhibited like this highest amount of bacta the costume she was wearing was of a 60s hippie sort of like not even if you put with a betta Nikki Jazz Singer so I thought she had some material costume but it became very quickly revealed of the of the
the potency of these people touched and woke up from their from their Slumber and it brought them almost to life again they have whatever she was she was very special and they are about to touch just brought it out this back to you in her. She took care of me cuz I said he took care of her she took care of me yes how are you ready I'm ready this is this is the introduction to volume one of the she'll probably the merita was entitled planting another lifetime preparation this fall begins in Calcutta 1896 with a birth of a b Ron day that was profile name
 and it ends in 1965 with a by charging aravindha but even on the Swami on his way to New York City aboard the steamship teledata
 the worldwide Fame of his divine grace AC bhaktivedanta Swami later known as
So Proud by Bush to come after 1965 after he arrived in America before leaving India have written three books
 I've actually three volumes of one book right there was the first cancer showing Bobby time
 in the next 12 years he was to write 60 crazy right I'm trying to write one I'm doing terrible before you get any more complaining about you but your writing and yeah well before he left he had initiated one disciple
 interesting imagine being the first to sign the crowd pod in the next 12 years he would initiate more than 4,000 well before he left India hardly anyone had believed that he could fulfill his mission of a worldwide Society of Krishna devotees but in the next decade he would form and maintain the international Society for Krishna Consciousness and open more than 100.
as an old man
 before sailing for America had never been outside of India but in the next 12 years he would travel many times around the world propagating the Krishna Consciousness movement it have been predicted in the scriptures and envisioned by great Saints
 a future profits God Brothers had even tried to make it happen they had gone to England only to return convinced that it was impossible is Western people can never understand Krishna bhakti they just won't be able to get it I get it I get that like how we supposed to get this I got to swing Krishna on a swing are you kidding why I stopped eating meat stop eating meat that's all I've heard that we don't even know what else to eat I've actually said that a different parts of my life like like oh you're vegetarians there's nothing to eat like it's so we're so thick
 but I'm not until she'll probably travel to
did it come to pass the westerners wholeheartedly took up the life advice of ism
 and became Krishna conscious devotees this story of Shield Prophet spiritual success as narrated in subsequent volumes of s.h.i.e.l.d. appropriately Lomita
 translate is the nectar of the pastimes of Shield Pro card beginning with volume to planting the seed New York City 1965 to 1966 get this present volume which covers most of his lifetime telling how he prepared himself for his late burst of revolutionary spiritual activity is most important these first 69 years form a complete traumatic life story and do not depend on anything he did later to explain them a by Charles father
 okay hotseat Mara what was Popeyes father's name
 read all of these memoirs
do Hyundai Hyundai Hyundai father Gourmand a carefully prepared to buy from childhood for the life of a vaishnava wanted him to Worship Christian encouraged him beginning when to buy was only 5
 in his Lord Juggernaut cart parade through the streets of their Calcutta neighborhood is little boy property was pulling a little card
 small rocky at your Festival the same Festival by was later to an act on a magnificent scale in many Western cities
 show property used to say in his latter days at whatever principles he had established as the leader of the Hari Krishna movement he learned in his childhood
 with but one important exception okay hot zero that's what was the one thing of proposition
 to spread mulch around the world that he didn't learn from his father
was it how to cook a glove job on that combine you think his father couldn't cook a mean gloves you in your dreams the point-to-point I don't know
 book publication and distribution then or you wish you had learned later from his spiritual Master it was his first meeting with his spiritual Master sure the Barclay Center to sarasvati in 1922 that Focus Shield profits future life into a meditation and how to carry out the mission preaching Krishna Consciousness in the west we have to go there right after dunga
 yeah I was just reading about it yesterday place where they first met
 maybe maybe we could bring the group they're like when we flying to Calcutta so that's interested maybe we started up we could have like a meal there or something like that so that would be cool that would be cool it's a beautiful they did such a nice job with that will restore in that place
let's think about that one okay
 after that first meeting his entire life is riding is taking some your ass because you're not sit his publishing books and finally his going to the West became part of his dedication to carry out the order of his of higher authority wasn't his own thing he was going as a representative show prapas obligation to his wife and children in his attempts to develop a business career in the pharmaceutical industry may appear in consistent with a single-minded determination to spread Krishna Consciousness yet his earnestness and pursuing these responsibilities and the way Providence finally extracted him from them proved important in his essential lifetime of preparation
 after he left his family responsibilities in 1950 he met with obstacles of obscurity and poverty
 and an insecurity and posed by the tumultuous times
she lived but again his struggle to continue his mission was part of his preparation in the light of Sheila Prophet unprecedented spiritual achievements in his latter life it seems inevitable that I should say something here about his being empowered by God
 according to the very scriptures that live that lives according to The Vedic scriptures the lives of certain individuals are part of God's mission on Earth in the west Jesus Christ is the best-known example of a chosen son sent by God from the spiritual world and in the East Nevada gratings tell the various avatars of Lord Vishnu incarnations of the Supreme Lord with specific names characteristics and activities Lord Krishna sometimes appears himself and sometimes he empowers a particular devotee to do his work what is that called Mara Hotsy
 what kind of Avatar
famous number anymore it's no big deal are either invested with the Shakti the lord of the energy with the power bill propert in his commentary on cheats on your church and Rita explains about souls and powered by Lord Krishna
 hairnet here's the quote there two kinds of living at these niches sitter and it did but other than that you said id never forgets his relationship with the person that with the Supreme personality where's the nipple butter is always conditioned even before the creation he always forgets his relationship with the Supreme personal / the order of the Supreme then it just sit a remains within this material world like an ordinary man but it's only business is to broadcast the glories of the Lord and then it just sit at all the images it is within this material world may appear to toil like ordinary men
nithya Shetty turnley perfected beings come in this world they may appear at first to toil in the world but actually then the actual Sun starts to shine and then they start to do what they're born to do give which is give like give God get truth disseminate it pretty amazing are you wanting to say you know that's exactly what we never said that though I never said that no I'm just I'm just a fallen so
 okay I'm ninja Banda eternally Bound in determining whether a person is empowered by God the main consideration is the quality of his work
and the Daytona Charger into the scholar valova Cecil or cheat on you quote the fact that you have spread Krishna Consciousness all over the world proves that you have Krishna Shakti
 transcendental power from Lord Krishna after she is passing away in 1977 as senior god brother b r Street R Maharaj quoted this same Christmas Shakti verse and applied it to prop hunt unless you've been empowered by Krishna you could not have spread Krishna Consciousness as he did okay we consider she'll probably as identity as Lord Krishna synpower represented the years of struggle described in this volume take on it
 when we consider then the years of struggle described in this volume take on a special sweetness sure these years revealed little-known events in the life of a person who was always wrapped in devotional remembrance of Krishna although he struggled through many hardships his struggles were not those of an ordinary man
solely to carry out the will of his Guru and Krishna I invite the reader to enjoy the very real human life story of Shield prop hide who has known this volume as a pie chart on
 I tell you we're going to struggle in this world some of us are struggling right now we're going to struggle why not struggle for such a noble cause to spread the truth to spread light to spread love to spread Christian why not struggle for that if you look at proud pie struggles okay couldn't find a place to stay couldn't find a a place to stablish Temple couldn't establish the temple day or tried harder to have done so so many walls and then it established we're always going to have troubles want to take up a massive Mission any what you're going to get the troubles anyway and submission up and then you'll have troubles with that and your legacy you leave a legacy instead of just really you know what I just squeaked by existence
 take out a bigger brighter
mission in your life I'm saying this cuz there's some people that when I say that it really appeals to them and they realize she had meant to be doing something more you don't want it could be just being part of a larger share like a small part
 yeah as long as your focus is as long as our focus is of service of light and love and truth of God and in that becomes okay how am I going to have them in a raised myself and raise my family and raise my going to raise my children in in God Consciousness how can I give this to other people they'll be some obstacles
 and that's great that it'll be much with that and as you get older and as you know
 the older you are in life is more East reflecting like I gave my life to this I gave my life to this and you know maybe I wasn't great at it but I did give my life to it and and Krishna is there with you and it it's just such a rewarding I feel like
rewarding feeling of giving your life to something Divine and while you're doing it releasing resentments releasing bad feelings releasing any knots in the heart we have towards what happened and some type of victimhood and then you rise up and you realize actually those struggles were my greatest Joys you know cuz I was actually always thinking about you Krishna even in the struggles how to make my family Krishna conscious or have it but had to give this to another person and
 it is or what it is when we look back and plow parts lifetime we see all the struggles now it's just a gripping story it's a gripping story almost like the Mahabharat it were will were listening to this gripping story that's getting us all closer and closer to God as we hear it you know
what you're saying right now to remind me of the Nugget from ribbon to rabindranath tagore
 yeah tell me he said I slept in and dreamt that life was Joy I woke and saw that life was service
 I acted and behold service was Joy
 you're going to move her yeah it's beautiful and then you realized yet you take up service just to get yourself out of the muck and mire selfishness and laziness and just
 and then after some time you realized it's actually to service you know
 we think about you. You don't deserve to become happy but actually you find that happiness is found to service her look in the mirror yesterday she finish the podcast you upload the podcast to him right into the kitchen started baking Focaccia and all different types of things all day long till everybody showed up she was just in there serving
were you happy there yes we both went to bed feeling like that was great we just had a whole day of us that was great I worked all day and we ate all day do I clean that clean my clean outside was inside I have an idea 6 introductions but there's a forward to this first volume written by Harvey Cox you just go you just go Harvey Cox is a professor of divinity at Harvard University so this is his forward to the first volume of Shield prabhas
 biography he writes it is a distinct an unusual honor for me to be asked to write a foreword to this eloquent and informative biography of his divine grace AC bhaktivedanta Swami prabhupada
 but I feel that I have to my great regret
 I never met him
during his sojourn here in America feel that I have met him the spiritual reality of a great teacher lives on in many ways not the least in the lives of those he has touched
 since I've come to know many of she'll probably has disciples over the past years as well as many devotees were influenced by him without knowing him personally I sense a certain acquaintanceship
 to write this forward seems then in some measure like introducing a friend what a nice way to start in all cases that a religious movement is a shame is the shadow of a great teacher still there's some measure of truth even in that familiar statement
 it will surely help readers of this book understand is Con better to know the man who founded it and to be aware
 of the soil from which he comes
that was you know what we did yesterday show is like the soil from which Krista comes in one Sense writer with a question about that comes from your one sentence hearing to go underground and yeah I'm from the bridge by Ciara from a resident about their love for Christmas did he send you the video of the Sheba the Mann act yes he did we should put up on our on our Instagram or Instagram stories that guy dressed like she able to come to the table every year and he's just he's just like crying he's really cry
 okay the soil from which you came
 the patient in care with which the author of this volume has reconstructed the long life Sheila Prophet had already lived even before he set forth for America makes were absorbing and inspiring reading I read it I confess not just because of my own interest and she'll probably not but because of the milieu
the author recreates tells us so much more than a mere life story could that was the point that has made great you read this biography and you really learned so much about
 India and about Indian spirituality and bhakti
 it reminds us of how every ensconced reminds us of how very ensconced she'll profit was the one of the oldest religious traditions in the world every calls how very much went on in the generation centuries and even Millennia before him that seems to be gathered and focused in his life and in his teachings
 in one Central property was not at all original and reading the story of his life raises questions about our typical restroom proclivity to attach such value to originality what's the book makes her sit here on the contrary is
show profit is a man who incarnates an ancient tradition
 the opening verse of the fourth chapter bug of agita
 the Indian text most precious to iskcon teach that the Ageless signs about to yoga what Christians might call the devotional path to God is always received by what the Indians call Autumn para that is it is passed from one teacher to the next in the living chain
 from from ancient times to the present show profit is best understood as this books presents him as one particularly effective Link in this chain brightness
 your dad must be added show property is also a unique person to say that the teachings of the ancient ones come to us through a series of teachers does not mean that the teachers themselves are interchangeable if they were so faceless there be little point in writing about
biography of any of them
 but this life of show profit is pointed proof that one can be a transmitter of Truth and still be a vital and singular person even even
 in a sense I now feel safe to use in some ways as original she'll probably lived during the particularly critical period of in Indian history that a British colonial rule and its aftermath he worked with and among the dozens of people who befriended opposed supported or ignored him
 he initiated back to godhead magazine and what almost anyone would consider a very Advanced age when most people be resting on their Laurels he hearkened to the Mandate of his own spiritual teacher and set out on the difficult and demanding Voyage to America Sheila properties of course only one of thousands of teachers but in another sense he's one in a thousand Maybe One in a Million
 as a Christian
find a very important impressive to me that you'll probably took it upon himself to bring the teaching he so well represents to America
 this sentence I'm sure requires some explanation
 first of all as a Christian that come from a tradition in which God's God's sending of someone to bring a vital message to those who desperately needed is held in very high esteem
 throughout the Hebrew scriptures Yahweh sends prophets to remind the people how far they have strayed from his will to expose the way they have misused the poor and failed and failed to defend the Widow and the fatherless
 in the New Testament Jesus sent forth his disciples two by two asking them to Take Along only the scanty is clothing and Equipment telling them to Bear the message of peace and salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth God himself is depicted as sending his only son into the world on a mission that would ultimately cost him his life Christians are taught to respect and admire
those were willing to pay the heavy price of leaving comfort and security behind to go somewhere else to carry a message of Liberation but a good writer this man is how I know
 today however many Christians have become comfortable and complacent not only unwilling themselves to engage in such a hardship but often unable to even understand or appreciate those who do
 it's a great loss even though some people claim it is a good thing that many Christians are no longer as interested in carrying out their message to other parts of the world that they become less presumptuous or arrogant I personally believe it has more to do a sloth
 and that safe safe to utx5 that's just guessing satiety safety t
now you on it
 and I think it means like wanting safety or something quality or state of being fed or gratified to or Beyond capacity okay so it has more to do with their sloth and say tighty of consumer Society than with humility I have little patience with zealous proselytizing no matter who inflict it on home I do believe however that any spiritual teaching with following is also worth sharing
 when I visited it said he said that in a very nice concise way when I visited India living in fact in the very place where she'll proposition is centered when David I was thankfully received by everyone there including the sages in the holy men and was asked to share my tradition with them
 I spoke to them as a Christian about what Jesus Christ means to me and about what his teachings has to
4 to the world they listened attentively and gratefully they're only complaint as I recall was that I had not spoken long enough Indians unlike Americans seem in no hurry to rush off to something else if there is a serious spiritual discussion to be followed given the fact that I was so well-received and she'll probably don't land I'm sorry that he and his students still offer find it so difficult to be heard or taken seriously here in America
 I'll change it that's all changing yeah I mean it cuz he's coming from a time where there were lawsuits against devotees were recalled called you know that all that kind of stuff right now
 yeah he was always stuck up for the devotees the one-in-a-million is understatement now if you realize that starts a really appreciate properties like alkylate how fortunate we are to shows up and change the course of the future you know I was last night I was asked to speak
on a particular subject
 they day I show you nothing is written in route goes to his natural body rest and reaches into which proper translate is a devotion
 he mentions that there are 50 qualities that Krista has 64 qualities
 of course he has unlimited w b like 64 important qualities and that the average Diva like people like us
 may possess up to 50 of those qualities and then I believe Lord Shiva possesses some more and then Lord Bishop possesses stillmore up to 60
 but that Christian has four qualities
 that could no one not even hear good trivia question
 Cybertron
 isn't engaging kills demons killing of demons no no no no
engages in loving pastimes with his devotees then he has Uniquely Sweet Lila midoriya Uniquely Sweet Lila each one is midoriya
 something like a tracks the universe are playing on his flute sound that they know midoriya that he has plays the flute playing
 nope, he's always surrounded by loving devotees very sweet devotees
 so the vote is the flu to past times and he has unique beauty it's just like a leather match group of adore you imagine that
 imagine that the point that I was making was this is
 if you hear that it could sound like like another severe and then the the Supreme the ultimate being the original Altima being the source of everything has these four qualities and no one else has you
think it'd be something more like what Lord Vishnu manifest like to his breathing Humana Fences Unlimited you and rice is very beautiful is that come on there's a lot of other beautiful flute players got there aren't they there must be something to that flute playing that that that is more wondrous and powerful than even the creation and destruction of the universe has unlimited universes and it's not even a joke so right it's like it's not even trying to be cute or humorous
 but there's something in these qualities of Krishna
 that speaks
 to the nature of all existence of like what's most important significant you know that Krishna plays that flew
 it's not a Nord it's not like Ordinary music but it's like
 it's like a call to the heart that overcomes everything that is actually more powerful and influential
 then
station in destruction in the maintenance of the universe isn't something you know my point being is that what sure the proper did was SRI chaitanya empowered this the goswami is over and Ivan to take all of the conclusions of these ancient texts assimilate them and present them in in in a way that it was like so clear and unmistakable that you could you could figure out the entire not just the universe not but like all of existence you can figure the whole thing out and you can understand where the Pinnacle of it is it and what's the potential for the for the soul to evolve to
 it's your property assimilated their messages and wrote them into his comment or so anyone can get it
 anyone anywhere in the world could have access to this most special confidential spiritual
 conclusions that and if it was
she'll probably doing that
 what would we make of a lot less you say Christian is Lila a sweet love affairs and in some of my say no no actually there's a but but but you know someone might look a little deeper say no you know there's some nice morals in those kids stories you know something more than just kids stories or someone might say very special storytelling traditions we should really look there's a lot of people stuff here it's actually Way Beyond any of that fall back of Krishna and his team is representing North is or unwanted things in our hearts and said the soul has a dormant potential to Love Unlimited lie that's been
apps that that we should our time trying to love things of this world that won't satisfy us we were actually an allusion an allusion tried it again and again film a god-shaped hole with things and stuff and people in Romance and adventure and adventure sports and everything except God because we're so afraid of that God because we know him is all cuz we think of him are conceived him as this all-powerful being that we must submit to be trained to think that God is horrible sadistic being that that you have to surrender to us is going to blow your head off it's almost like you know what you think of surrender it's like the SWAT team surrounds you surrender a SWAT team what you know because my topic was Lila midoriya that that he has incredibly sweet pastimes yeah that's one of the four things that even Lord vishnu's not demonstrating
you know that I said well let's read a little bit of Christmas Lila and I would just read a few verses from the tenth Candlebox with time and it's like I was reading verses that were like
 they're talking about how Krishna and this is his other you know Incarnation father on his brother
 are crawling in the mud of Randolph and the little boys that can't even walk yet
 they're crawling in the mud covered in mud and they hear the tinkling of ankle bells of some women and they think or there's Mommy right because they know Mommy has his bells on her ankles and then they go Crawling After these ladies in those ladies turn around they look and see all look how adorable Little Krishna and then they realize that's not Mommy and then they get afraid
 and then they turn around start crawling back to Mommy now
that's
 what the Supreme Being does out of his own will he and is not lie that is just kind of like faking it he actually gets lost in the delay in the play and when the mother see Krishna turn around and go all of hair is Mommy they get flooded
 with
 an experience
 that is so beyond anything that money can buy the money of this world, right no matter if you can reach the peak of material success and whatever you might experience is completely dwarfed by that experience that is what the soul is meant to be experienced in that kind of exchange of love in the the Motions in the feelings that are potential to be experiencing at every moment to be immersed in Divine love eternally is what Christmas is all about and the way that she'll pop
propepper said is like he's giving anyone and I shared as I often do you know that like you know like I had these friends growing up there were just like these wild this kids that didn't even not only didn't graduate from high school they didn't even go to high school
