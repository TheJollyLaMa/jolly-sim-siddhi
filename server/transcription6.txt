Aircrete Test for Foundation & Insulation #Aircrete #AircreteHarry #AircreteTest #AircreteSamples

what's up everybody this is Eric read Harry and today I'm doing 20 different experiments we are creep so
 few weeks ago I did a foundation for a dome on building Upstate New York and doing the monolithic pour aircrete Dome the foundation was made of aircrete I made a mistake when I did that Foundation
 I was supposed to use
 a lot less phone then I ended up using which made the cement not strong enough to hold my screws so the technique I'm using up there is an air form and the air form gets bolted
to do to the foundation and then that are form is filled with air pressure and the air pressure is so great that it ripped the screws out of the foundation so that Foundation is still perfect for building a structure on top of the issue is it did not have the strength to hold screws in from being pulled out
 so these are like the screws I was using in the foundation
 what happened is the air pressure become so strong from holding the air form up because there are form will hold the weight of cement and rebar so even that extra weight on top produces even more pressure inside and so the screws ripped out of the foundation so the foundation wasn't strong enough to hold the screws
but for compressive strength to build a regular wall and everything on top of it it's fine it's just it wasn't strong enough to stop a screw from ripping out of it because of tremendous air pressure so the test I'll be doing today will not only show me what the best mix will be for doing Foundation but I'm also taking it to the opposite end
 4 very light and insulated so today's test will involve
 using the standard Eric remix which is a 194 lb bag of cement with 6 gallons of water and the container you add the foam in can vary from 32 gal to 50 gal or 17 gal that part berries but the cement
2 water makes will stay constant in these tests that I'm going to do the thing that I will be changing is the amount of phone that I had to get a system so
 most people know of making aircrete using either 45 gallon or 50 gallon drum of what I'll be doing today is a small-scale experiment so I'm taking the 94 lb bag of cement and I divided it by 20 so I'll be there in twenty different experiments using 4.7 lb of cement wear whatever the equivalent of water is believe it's two and a half pounds of water two and a half pounds of water to 4.7 lb of cement that will be the constant what will change is the amount of phone that I'm adding so I'm doing ranges as high as a
200 gallon so what that means is if you take one 94 lb bag of cement and 6 gallons of water you mix that in a 200 gallon container that I filled with foam that's what that would be equivalent of so it's going to be a very light this is just a test to see
 how the aircraft comes out being so incredibly light
 and I'll be taking it down from that point so
 I set up a 200 gallon container now I'm going down to 150 gallon container to 100 gallons to a 50-gallon which I've done before to a 40-gallon 32 gallons 20 and 10 gallons so again that is just
 imagine I had all of those containers and all the sizes and I'm adding
same amount of cement and water to the mall and I'm just a sad I'm just changing the phone that's all I'm doing with this experiment
 so after that experiment what I'll be doing is adding sand to the cement and I'm just doing four different scientist cement mixer so again the cement and water ratio stays the same but I'll be adding sand to it so I'll be doing three bags of sand to one bag of cement to bag of sand to one bag of cement one bag of sand to one bag of cement and a half a bag of sand to one bag of cement
 so I'll be doing those different tests and all of those tests will give me different compressive strength I won't be testing the compressor strength but the test I will be doing is putting a
screw into there and I'm pulling this screw out and saying what kind of force is it takes and I have a meter that I'll be using for that
 so is it a pool a pool push M so if I put this flat and here on the bottom
 if you look at the gauge here as I push that'll move up
 then it'll lock and so the same goes for pulling so I'll put a hook on the top part of it
 rival zero it out
 and then I'll
 attach it to a screw somehow and pull it up and we'll see
 how much force it takes to rip that screw out
 so
this is one of the test I'll be doing
 today another test in the future will be actually for compressive strength so I'm in talks with a local company now that does cement testing with a test compressive strength with Samantha and these 300-ton compressors and disgusting with them now
 pricing and all that other good stuff so hopefully it'll be really cheap so that I can do the test and I'm talking to him about videotaping the whole thing and so that's another test hopefully in the very near future so
 after I add the sand and I'll be testing that cement using this tool
 the other test I'll be doing
 is using this cement
so this has one made ingredient which is calcium chloride I've pour this into a 5 gallon bucket before and throw in Drexel and I tried to make foam and this will not allow you to make phone freshly added to the water I let this sit in that same bucket of water over night then I added the Drexel to it and I was able to produce phone so since this is going to be helping us to make sure quicker I'm thinking of adding it into the phone because I'll I have my phone bubbles which I have this cement around it which hopefully will cure quickly and keep my bubbles my air pockets in it so I'll be testing this out and with this I'll be doing one two three four five different tests using this and I'll be
pouring all my test samples into
 these little buckets here that I got from the dollar store for a dollar
 anyway and then I have one other test with some special white powder Crystal that I'll be testing out and if that works out as well as I heard it works I'll be letting you all know what it is and how best to use it so anyway that's what I'll be doing today so I guess I'm here they'll probably be a lot of fast-forwarding
 so this is my water
 I have a Mark here cuz I'll be refilling this obviously multiple times at least 20 so that's marked out and I'm going to have to wait as cement out because it's not easy to get a perfect level to see where the line
I mean I can guesstimate a 64 oz so I can put it in their tablet and if I'm a little under 64 I know I have approximately 4.7 lb of cement in here so
 I'm going to throw this in a bucket
 I'll see if this works if this works at all I'll be able to use this to mix with my cement
so this is going to be the control
 this is Jess going to be
 were you sore cement and water so we'll see how that compares to adding a full minute
okay so this first one is
 going to require 9.6 gallons of phone
 so I just realized I needed a bigger container to mix it all
 so I'm going to fill this with phone
 2 * almost two times
hey so we have my aircrete mix here
 a lot of bubbles
 that is uniform
usually it but with this amount of foam in there so
 okay so
 the first test here is regular cement
 it feels like it's getting warm already
 super light
 to see if popping
 we'll see what that does
 wait between these two
 behaving look all the water coming up on this one
 okay

cancel this is for the hundred gallon skip 250 250 + 7.1 gallons I went down to the 4.6
 just fine
 Keystone cement
 didn't make that as well as I wanted to
 so that's not going to be as strong as it should be this cement that was still stuck in here that didn't mix well so that's not going to be a hundred percent
Okay so
 the next is going to be 50 gallons
 I'm going to skip right over to 7.1 gallon 150 gal that does 200 gal
 I want to write to 100 gallon so from there we're going to go to 50 gallon
 so the 50 gallon
 requires 2.1 gallons of phone
so this is the
 what is the mixed
 most of you making your queen have made 50 gallon
 the 194 lb bag of cement
set a timer to be for 40 gallon mix
 what is 40 gallons
 do you know why I'm going to skip right over 14 go to 32 gallons
 so this 32-gallon one
 I'll take 1.2 gallons of phone

cancel this is about 2.6 worth of phone
 which would be for a 20 gallon container
 again this is if you were using 94 lb bag of cement
 and you had a 20 gallon container
 you would use
 20 gallons of phone
 I just divided it down
 2.6 for the amount that I'm testing here

okay so I have my
 cement cement and water only no phone that's the control
 then look how much the bubbles of collapsed are ready this was the 200 gallons
 sample this is the
100 gallon sample again when I say two hundred and hundred I'm referring to the containers the things you would use to mix the aircrete up if you were going to be using it for example the idea behind it is for installation and so we'll see how that yours or what not so anyway we have again control 200-150 3220 + 10
 so that's it for these will let this cure after it's yours
 after they cure will screw to screw in and then we'll do the pool test
 okay
 that's it for this one I'll get back to you on what happens
text is I'm going to be doing the accelerated test
