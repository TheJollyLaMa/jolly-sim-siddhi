come to just have you want States
 thanks are the only mildly lost in the streets the streets of Brussels for maybe 20 minutes
 okay and after giving a right here on mild heart attack I will
 there go okay
 hey buddy I'm making lemon I am one of the foundations and I'm super super excited to be talking today about deep end I feel like filed mine it's one of those o g g pen projects before deep end with Billy a catchphrase in the way it is now and I'm so excited to see this vision of the world actually taking shape
 so I think that we should
good thing today a little bit about how file claim is critical infrastructure for the next generation of the web at the very least data storage is critical infrastructure for the next generation of the web and I think that we should talk a little bit about how data storage can really be the underpinning of this Deacon Revolution that we have all been thinking about and talking about for so long
 I would love to talk a little bit also about how file claim and Powers other deep in project to succeed and a little bit about what's driving the demand for defend
 the first thing a little bit about internet infrastructure how it came to be what it is today its pitfalls and the potential that we have bread
 so right now and we can take a look at
take a look at the slide and I want everybody here to think a little bit about when was the last time that you tried to go to a website and you got a 404 error when was the last time you tried to get some critical piece of information and it wasn't there for you last week this is actually a real-time view of Internet outages around the world so it's a reminder of just how vulnerable this piece of infrastructure that we have come to rely on this piece of infrastructure around holding all of the world's data is actually pretty is pretty week is pretty is pretty fragile and can break and most most points in time
 one of the big reasons for this is that
 all the world
it's really held by but essentially five companies we have Ali Baba IBM Google Microsoft Azul and Amazon AWS
 and I think that like there's a lot of obvious reasons that having a bunch of for-profit companies holding up critical infrastructure is problematic
 but
 a couple of the ones that I would love to point out is beyond the fact that a lot of these businesses work off of trying to use your data as a fundamental part of their business model damn cough cough
 but also that it's just a handful of small companies write like we have really truly it come to rely on having all of the roads information at our fingertips and this is only possible
because of a set of companies that there was just said with the exception of IBM for you no less than less than 40 years right and I kind of just got into this game
 in a recent study and this is how you know I'm I'm from the US with these are all us focused but from recent study around people concerned about the internet over a thousand years adults only 22% think that the internet is extremely fragile or very fragile
 get over half 55% think they have confirmed that they've lost digital information that they really cared about
 83% of Americans want technology companies to do more in to enable them to control their personal information and how it's used
 but we don't have any real Usher
that the company is that we entrust with the state are going to do that in fact we have a fair amount of information saying that they want there's a reason closures like Shutterfly share sites and apples termination my photo streams were millions of photos where to leave it as precious memories were gone and people weren't expecting that but this is something that we've all come to expect in the stage of capitalism where if a for-profit company is holding on to a data we know that there's going to be errors in it
 we think that date online is secure and resilient only if it is held an open-source platform only buy something where everybody involved in using it can understand exactly how would use do I ingest
 currently 400 million terabytes of data come onto the internet every day this is parcel
fueled by a i and all of the you know new revolutions that are happening in the world of a I I actually got into the world of data storage and got into the world of creeped out about flying through caring about signs of a date with us I had a biotech company and I was one of those people paying Amazon you know $140,000 a month to store 17 bytes of data to try to help solve cancer and one of the things that really affected me was realizing that the problems that we were having and solving these very very fundamental human issues like new drug Discovery making better cancer drugs was not afford to buy all of your fault science but actually having some of this infrastructure around data and public data storage the ability to access the data
that's the ability to run you know modern interrogations on large data sets
 so we more than 400 million terabytes of data and Craig globally everyday large language of bottles like organized like Google's Gemini vast amounts of data but this data is controlled by a small number of companies
 people are concerned about what happened to their data and their questions about where the information that they're consuming is going and and if this data is authentic cuz if we're looking at the next generation of technology for looking at AI you know we also have no that is by garbage in garbage out if we're not going to be having any sort of all visible standards about what's going in to Rai models we're not going to be able to trust the things that come out of it
 I depend create a real better alternative to this at school
the decentralized web is about trust and autonomy and see centralized physical infrastructure networks season project free real actual use of all modern-day alternatives to decentralize models they create real Alternatives that are owned by the people that are not promised off of business models that want to use personal individual data up to you to make the money for the company to get to increase shareholder value
 there's more secure than more private and they're more accessible and you know at least a file Twain and I think a lot of the other weather models that were talking about today we're looking at you you know Game Theory and real incentive structures that rely on everybody who's involved in the project to have a real personal incentive for keeping the city safe and secure
 Iowa
new marketplaces for a tools and services are also more resilient and they have no single points of failure like we're seeing on the earlier map
 5.3 it's an open market for Desert so I'm sort of a little busy doing that and most people here today have like a little bit of a background about what file Finance but Ryan but he doesn't file fine is a decentralized storage protocol it's an Eldorado that lets people store their data a little bit like Airbnb little bit of data and then that data is Content ID did I would like a Content hash so that you have studied us toward everywhere not in a location-based way but instead in a way that is specific to the content itself
 today there's more than 2,500 storage provider systems around the world these are all independent small businesses and they contribute
5 exabytes of raw storage capacity this allows for system that is both decentralized and has like inherent security values around that but also I is but also is more aligned with user interest because you're looking at a system that is not based off of using customer data as a primary start tomorrow
 on welcome to La Botana me over what happens their data and who gets to use it they know exactly what's happening because it's an open source system and they aren't limited storing their data with just a few big powerful tech companies who leaves team change their ideals and their models over the years
 a lot of reasons that people use filed mine and they're looking at data sovereignty they're looking at resilience-building at cost-efficiency it's amazing we can provide all these values
with a lower per terabyte of storage cost more than you would have on traditional storage writers and the biggest thing and the biggest thing I'm hoping to and some people here is in a bacon we're really looking for people to be building on top of valve my network we're looking to make all of our offering for something much more similar to the kind of plug and play models you've got from us and we would love for everybody here to be thinking about what things are missing from that stack and how they can build on top of it again I'm sort of assuming I'm talking to him in the audience here who is really really bought in already to the like moral reasons to have a defense structures but what we need is what we need is people to build out the rest of the stack
 things that are really the demand drivers right now on file fine is looking at immutability and the fruit storage
so if I open crates and auditable network that lets you look at where the data came from so if you're looking at running something like an AI model you can look at what was used in that training except in a way that's not really possible by scraping the modern web it's not only Otterville auditable but it's so and because as soon as that data set is is created and resolved there's a unique content hash around it so if that means of anything about that changes it is visible in fear because it gets a new content Ash around it
 if I've been off also offers a lot of information about Providence and authentication so the same way that that that that like data sets that you can say hey this is like the the snapshot of went went into my AI model
the way that that is a provable real content hash the data that is sucked up into that model can be proved a goal by a contact hash as well
 5.9 is not just another storage solution but it is the further top prototype for the deep end movements larger vision is currently the largest decentralized storage Network it's globally decentralized is not just a centralized and concept or Envision for we truly do have start Riders all over the world it is open source is open and it is accessible it is something that we actively encourage people to review audit and build on top of
 this community has been one of the old-school you know OG depend project and we really do have an innovation mindset and so you know my biggest Hope from this talk is that we can get more people who have been kind of
sing about building on top of files and kind of thinking about integrating filecoin into the other whether products that they are trying to build and get more people to make files my in the storage for their back in most importantly we got real-world impact filecoin is something that has hundreds of real-world Institutions during the 8 on 59 right now putting University's research institutions like I said this is how I got into my old one that I found a real problems and the way that we were examining biological data and files when was one of the best way I can find for it
 there's nonprofit groups there's media property is there's giant went through projects like Solana that are all using filed mine as their back-end and I would really like to encourage everybody care to think about using it as yours
 there's some other large deep in projects that are building when cells on top of Alpine just if you needed any more incentive
Berkeley out is project building computer on top of a coin that's another open source project so if you were thinking about using decentralized Storage Solutions as your way of looking at where your data sets can come from for building a model look at Barclays has a great thing to like look at build on top of a video infrastructure we're working a lot with live here which was built a web 3 video models we have a bunch of sensory integration and some of the real world ways you can use his right now with weather XM that uses file Queen has their back-end but builds their modeling using a sensor network of individual the like weather satellites can be sent out to your house I giving you significantly more accurate and real-time data around your weather
which is a and L2 that is on top of phallic lion that enhances our capabilities and use cases for data utilization across the network
 so I really hope that has exemplified all the ways the Jeep and networks can generate effects that really really can compete with our standard you know our standard web two large tech company model that we've all kind of accepted as being like the easiest way for a back-end but I don't think that anybody here is here because they want to take an easy way I think that everybody here is taking a harder path and working on the pup 3 Technologies because you fundamentally believe that there's something really good here that we need to be taking back this internet infrastructure
how to be owned by the people and follow friends are real way to do that so there's a great cuz a lot of ways to do it I hope that anybody here cuz interested in doing that will come up that me or somebody else on our beautiful 540 mulakum are sitting over here right now but we have a lot of ways that you can hook in and that you can work with us because we would really like to see he is a fundamental infrastructure of the internet being taken back thing only by the people being moved back into open source projects the same way that it was in the 1990s the same fundamental views of why the internet is important we really have an opportunity to do using filecoin as your background data storage Network
 5 Wayne is so much more than a storage solution it really paved the way for a revolution how we structure and operate our digital infrastructure it's a way for
centralized resilient and Equitable digital future and it only takes a tiny bit of extra work right now to make it all happen and will pay off not just in the like the the moral concept but also is literally significantly cheaper and so as AI comes in an excuse to generate data and Gobble up all over compute power I would hope that I can give us a lot of people in this room right now to think about using file fine as your back end and used this you know excitement over data and our current weaknesses in our digital infrastructure as a reason to take the extra effort and use this as the time to move back over into a system that is truly decentralised but it's owned by the people that is open purse
 thank you so much
