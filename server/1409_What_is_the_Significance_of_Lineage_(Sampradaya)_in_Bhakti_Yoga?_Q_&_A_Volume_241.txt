 yeah it's one of these things that
you hold in your heart forever and cherish it you cherish it in your heart forever and I find like when I'm in the west deal in my thing here my heart goes back to those places and it just it holds me your tender little Thumper
 what was be like a mother holding the baby alright any other interesting news Mara Mara Mara is cooking this weekend and hit it out the park we went to with burritos last night always a winner I'm ready to convince her to open a burrito shop
 that would be nice if any one of those trucks a burrito truck happening every day
daily and you can go to talk to your cover your back, more wisdom of stages.com to see that online meeting list in New York City was like there is burrito truck Bears burrito truck you can do that I better become the number one burrito truck in New York yeah those you suffer from some sell that I can help us talk about this matter what is a stem from the part Testament of the girls field hockey game even sometimes these high Achievers have self-doubt I think it's I think it's okay let's get to work use and we'll try to get some aged quickly as possible
we love her she's part of the family
 come on down Catherine a straight from Beantown Boston he might have seen her on Zoom cold plunging with their iPhone in her hand walking into the Atlantic Ocean also under a handstand handstand and sometimes I'll see what she does with a cold plunge has she sits and chance of round of Joppa in like 40 degree water how fast do you chant that and she looks at me to go some Christian is in the cold and I was like is that the bottom of her own realization that she can ask because maybe it's something like when you're in that cold that your your body is rebelling and you you're feeling a distance from your own body and you're taking shelter the part of Mama and your heart is unlike that exactly are you can no longer be on a sensual mental platform
it's got to be I do I do this is it I'm in here with you Krishna which was keeping warm when the little chatter around her do you have a special warming garment that you put on when you come out of the cold thing like some kind of roller stick thing or something I'm pretty warm when I come out that's what happens you get like an extra heat when you come out right going to have to be closer than Mike maybe she needs to hold it because it's not close enough to them I could ever be closer some question today how can we serve you
 Basin cities to all the devotees my question is what is the significance of such a Daya
 and it kind of a three-part question. Why don't we why don't we pass
Guru bead when we chance to tell all your questions in the other question but okay and then what's like the correct way to pay obeisance to use for the deities like you do it on the left side cuz it's I've heard cuz it's close to your heart but then I've also heard that's like the sun for daiya way to how what's the significance okay what's talk about our spiritual lineage in my question. What are you what are you jump on this one goes to a Daya literally the word something. It has to do with like giving giving very freely giving very liberally or handing down as well
 and so the idea is that dumb if you took all of the books even if you just took all the books that should be a sativa wrote who is the shop TV show Avatar right his is the person that was directly empowered
by Shri Krishna to present the Vader this eternal knowledge in written form for the people of this age even if you just took all his books which has a large body of books right you got the four Vedas you got to punish outside that's a hundred eighty bucks right there
 you got the Mahabharata 200,000 versus and then you got all the Piranhas all together I think it's like $520,000
 so that's like a lot of information it's got to be more than that no I think that's what it is I mean there's always different ways, right cuz like that's in our age in our planet and everything like the the mob bar two is so many people from other planets that are like hundreds of thousands of versus or even milk
something like that first moon landing went to the moon rocks and dust we did find a very big Mahabharat 2 million facts about his rocks Dustin and everyone in India starts going crazy so if you take all of that information hardly anybody's going to read the entire thing and how you going to get like a practical understanding and application of it all you need schools of thought you need you need to schools that are going to teach it in a particular way and those schools are going to have a particular goal that that in otherwise they're going to identify here's what this is all mentally too
 and here's how you can understand all this knowledge and practice it to achieve that goal and that's what these lineages are some poor diet
do you know they're there is for violation of its a nice for some precise that that that have established that Devotion to Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna is the goal is is the Sid Hunter it is the the conclusion of all these texts at once meant to connect with it with Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna true devotion and and traditionally it's it's taught that even Within These text it's taught that those
 Lydia just go back to Lord Vishnu or to Lord Christian self and they come down through four different important lineage Founders are established there is Lord Brahma there's Lakshmi Devi there's the four Kumar's that count as one and there is Sheba and so down this
for letting you just come down throughout the ages and in the Kali Yuga a certain grade teachers or charges have kind of codified and brought forth those teachings more elaborately in those would be ramanuja charya and the industry sampradaya
 madhvacharya in the brahmas a Daya Vishnu Swami in the Chivas a die or route or Sanford Eye and then bar catch Aria in the kumars some Verdi these lineages are each
 did they have these each one is kind of like a tree you know because they Branch out you know like what one like a family tree family tree so there's like the trunk of the tree the root of the tree and then they Branch out in different pot in pot has different chains of Gru's and disciples the idea that there's
Ray care in handing down the knowledge and preserving that knowledge in an authentic way otherwise even if you accept all these texts is truth how to make sense of them and how to practice them is going to be very elusive is going to be very difficult to have to figure that out of One's Own now I wanted to mention something because
 last week's interview with with Professor Dave and Bridals person have great respect for him very learning person and I love his books and inside but brother not to ask him a question about a verse that speaks to exactly what you're bringing up here Catherine and that is a verse from the Padma purana
 which states saw a die of a Visionary mattress Tame Impala it says that monsters that are not received in one of these genuine
bias
 that they bear no fruit
 it's very interesting statement
 but that verse rug I'm not sure if you were where we're going to put that verse speaks of these for some Fordyce like the right that's where they're laid out it says everything it's a translation entire verse any Mantra that does not come into Civic succession and it's a diet is considered to be fruitless therefore for divine individuals will appear in the age of Kali to found the simplest schools the founders of these for vaishnav some four daughters are Lakshmi or SRI rudra Brahma and Son appreciate it. Kumar for Seneca Kumar
 and the acharya's of the Kali age who follow in their lines will appear in the holy city of proof show tomorrow in Arisa that's Juggernaut Tori
 now when when Professor Brian spoke buy that he he
 he said well this is just one verse
you know this is you know among so many verses I guess in a sense some
 minimizing its significance
 my response to that would be yes but are Great acharya's have chosen this verse out of so many thousands and highlighted it that shows its significance right there that's a great we are disagreeing with what he said or your let me put it this way the way that he characterized it I would not characterize it but he was he was careful and
 he said he said I don't want to dismiss it
 but he also characterized it as a political thing he said it kind of felt to him like was a political or bureaucratic kind of statement you know in other words that I owe you need to be in our lineage if you're going to benefit
his Mantra in my my point to it was okay I could understand how it could be used that way but the idea of the permit it comes with a the monster comes with a report the significance in the meaning of it so you so you have some attention while you're chanting understood its the intention and the as well as the attention to the Mantra that has its significance entirely with that rug and act like there's a famous person in the cheat on you charge and Rita Bahu drama kharash of inaccurate to not turn up higher Krishna party Primadonna that one can go on Channing this holy name
 four lifetimes and never achieve the goal of Krishna Prima if it's if what if it's done
 without the right mood without the right understanding and that's what comes in some / Daya right so professor
I was saying I don't see Christian is a bureaucrat who's like oh you must come in a particular lineage in order for me to accept you I don't interpret the versus as communicating that. What I hear communicated through this versus that very mercifully
 devotion is handed down through these channels
 and if you want to achieve it and anyone can benefit
 from Channing the name but if you want to achieve the fruit of chanting the holy name and what is that fruit is Krishna Prema love for Krishna if you want to achieve that highest of all goals
 that most precious and rare of all goals you don't achieve it just on your own by pick up at lunch and walk around chanting it
 you'll earn an end end Professor Bryant he said you know the Theology of the Holy Name Is Not
complicated thing if it's not different from Christian well that's something that he learned through some for Daya right and that's something that you taught through some for diet and honestly nominated for the subject of the Holy Name is an incredibly Rich topic that are Charlie is Right thick books on so that we can really approach that name with a deep and pure understand so that we can eventually change that name. You know that is mentioned it that they're ten offenses to the holy name and in our lineage in our gallery of ice never lineage it's very common that the group will speak on these 10 offenses
 at the time of initiation because the essence of the relationship between the group and disciple and some for Daya
 is that the girl restraining the disciple to chant that name purely because that name is going to reveal everything to them
 and
So within those 10 offenses it's being instructed how our men to understand our relationship advice numbers that that's important for us to receive the fruit of the Holy Name how we relate with the name itself how we relate with the guru how we relate with the shastra what are our sentiments and understanding of these very important. Fuzzy's very very important truths within this this broad practice for the fruit of for Krishna Prema that fruit that ultimate fruit to be achieved
 what is meant to be trained in this way it's it's it's it's not saying oh you have to be part of our of our click but it is something like saying that I said wanted to become a Supreme Court Justice
 and and Somerset all but really that's your ambition or that's it
wonderful you know what are you are you applying to different universities I need to become a Supreme Court Justice you probably have to go to Yale or Stanford or Columbia University or one of these very top lost with no no I'm just going to read the books myself you know no it's not a sectarian a bureaucratic consideration is that none that you were meant to be trained by the best legal Minds that exists if you're going to achieve that goal of becoming a Supreme Court Justice and cereal if you want to cheat, you need to be trained in the sump retire in order to understand the nature of the practice of vodka yoga the nature of the Holy Name took two to develop the right knowledge about it and the right sentiments about it and to develop the right practice in the right lifestyle in order to fully receive the benefit of that name and the fruit of that name so I don't see that verse as a as a sector
Korean bureaucratic station could be used that way anything could be misused sure but but but I see it as a in the fact OK Google and it is one verse amongst hundreds of thousands but the fact that this will not track of our Gtalk for sure the monkey stood on two stars fighting Taco show the body of a notochord in our shoe the proper quoted this verse many times
 it indicates a significant amongst those thousands of versus a hundreds of thousands of versus so the so so the sun / diarrhea is how knowledge is preserved how we how we understand how to practice how we is that it's it's it is Mercy it is you know the professor was saying you know I feel it's not so much about this bureaucratic consideration has to do is surrender yeah this is our process for surrender this is how we surrender surrender through this a diet
beloved Brother David Bushnell one of the grade teachers in our sampradaya he characterized it this way in his book called prameya retinopathy he said the Lerner disciple
 should daily remember the entire Flawless discipline succession should be thinking about all these teachers are handing this down to it from them come single-minded devotion
 and from such devotion
 the pleasure of Lord Krishna comes and such so that's the idea that any certainly anyone could benefit from Changi this name but that fruit of Krishna Prema
 that that that blessing of Chaumont a router I know that that that that that that grants one that Prim that is something that it is it doesn't just come about easily or just by chance or or just because I'm sincere if you're sincere then
I can lead you to to a genuine lineage that will train you specifically
 and how to practice body in the way that's most pleasing to Krishna and in through what you'll be blessed by their highest of all aspirations at Krishna Prema the silver that was so good it was so thorough but I'm going to bring this right back to Earth okay okay and it starts with these two word tuchus to it starts with these two words repeat after me Kimbo Slice you do Kimbo slice's Kimbo slice's okay Kimbo Slice razee street fighter crazy Street Fighter Kimbo Slice videos of him like this fighting people in backyards and then people like started picking up his video started going viral so somehow we ended up going into mixed martial arts and getting on like UFC and things like that everybody really wanted to see what this guy do like do with a mixed martial art
so first of all he had to dip his hands into official training he had to go to some official teachers Street Fighters are pretty crate cuz they're so darn crazy that they can actually really good Fighters but eventually when you get to a certain level of fighting after while you really got it there is a way to throw a punch there's a way to throw a Kik there's a way to throw an elbow there's a way to head but that it's all been passed down you can even embellish it in the same way sort of Picasso was classically trained but then embellished but they come through those lineages and those traditions and because of that they get some power and eventually if and eventually Kimbo Slice you know he would get beat by these people have been trained that sometimes you can surprise egg I even a trained guy and gets up but if you actually if you really want to become the best at your game you'll take these high-level people than practicing
tradition
 a refined your practice to get to the ultimate goal
 champion of the UFC heavyweight
 Christian Prima can you go through this
 Kimbo Slice people it does it does that covered well for you Catherine yes thank you is part of it the chance again for a are the Kimbo Slice win a competition audition visual my head hit the pillow with with this is going to bed I like checked my phone and it says that there is a purpose for a drug. Now that there was now I understand the purpose that was the last image I saw Kimbo getting beat in the UFC
I understand that Christians behind everything or see from Kimbo Slice you're going to have a field day Miami Jimmy James says okay so it took but they're more questions you have about the chanting of the on the beads maybe I can do that another time.
 It was very nice sorry it's stuck with me
 Brian is here with a really nice Sun Mitch and it's great to have you back here very sincere they're both
writers she said I read your book would you like me to comment on it I was like I've got a real soft shell that is a table I want to hear how did you like rugs book
 I think that it achieved the goal of being able to inspire people to look at themselves and the world differently and reach toward a bit more retrieve the gold was that your goal
 my goal is Krishna Prema and to be Kimbo Slice so
 okay but you question memory and to ask your thoughts on the fact that you know consumerism and materialism are almost becoming more powerful having more of an influence in a draw and so
my question is do you see the spiritual life the bhakti life having an impact on that or does the other one still have a more powerful draw what are your thoughts on that consumerism is Big so I was saying this morning and in class
 only lived is brahmacharya in the ashram I had two shirts and two doty's
 it was nothing else to buy
 and there was almost a sadness
 that there's nothing to buy anymore because there's a such a purchasing things
 and I remember back when you've given up becoming a brahmacharya and you make that transition to now I'll wear the white robes and I get to buy different color or toes different color shirts it was always like
can we go in the temple gift shop and look at all the colorful shirts I want a pink one I want a light blue on I want one that ties on the side it's like it's like the options have opened up for me and then you want to decorate your apartment or your house and I will crush the picture here in a little thing here a Southeast Asian chair or what would be a cool alter in my house and that desire for consumption is so huge to fulfill sort of like a hole in the heart that when an end it's a beautiful thing about a monastic life is that gets Stripped Away and in that sadness you got to find God and so that should sort of always be what we're going for the problem with consumption is it never fills the belly you're always hungry it never ends its insatiable so and
I think as cultures get more and more consumption has
 they'll feel an emptiness that goes with that and the probably explore other things to consume like okay I can
 whatever people collect nowadays clothing watches you know t2tea know my friend is getting me into this if you look into real new ones type of collection collect things you know and and and Pokemon cards all types of crazy things but the fact is they want to fill two instead of switching one consumption to another a person who gets materially exhausted
 has now entered the threshold of their spiritual life
 and let's sort of pray that
exhausted or otherwise me and I think me and Dylan is weird driving some of us are driving jalopies and drop some what's the driving Lamborghinis that either way
 we have no GPS we have no clue where to go why we're going anywhere what we're doing so some of us are born with really we was at either got a career or we got a silver spoon in her mouth and we've just driving Lamborghinis around and some of us are struggling we never had any pay my parents were broke and we're driving jalopies around or you're already know we're dropping a bicycle around and either way there were lost and Krishna Consciousness is actually giving direction is giving instructions on the way how to refuel how to maintain
vehicle and it's it's fine tuning the explicit dropped pin to continue with this analogy dropped actually where to go and it's quite beautiful it's quite beautiful because otherwise we waste time we waste resources and we waste our life just just bumping into walls
 what do you think
 I think it's a thin I think that that people are finding it hard to find that spiritual connection and where to go to get it I think it's just easier to fill to keep filling landfill sites and with stuff we don't want and then it more things that we want and so I'm wondering if you see cuz I'm feeling like it's it's thin and there's not as many
foxy spiritual people that are creating that space do you see that that it's to do see it differently do you see that there is that opportunity and where do they find that opportunity this is a this is where you come in
 this is where you come in because you're very creative and you're very thoughtful you have to figure out ways that you can sort of spread out branches and extend yourself to other people who sort of get that cuz you'll hear people say this like
 I know this career I'm doing a sort of pointless but you know I guess that's life you know that's what we do in life that's not what you do in life that's what you do with a non thought what a life that's not contemplated so it's our job is to find people that are sort of a little we reach out for people who are in pain and we get them some comfort. That's your devotees do but then we
the people are sort of like satisfied and we give them some uncomfort we like it a little shake them a little wake him up a little and that's what we do we extend our hand in that way as well but when we went to get to this point questioning what's this all about then we should sort of like hear this and so we always have to build bridges for people and in our heart of hearts we should understand we should fully realize that there is nothing of this world that will satisfy her heart and we have to really be convinced of that we have to really exhaust every type of options every plan b c and d in my mind to make me satisfied in this world exhausted all well what if I just sell everything and move to the Caribbean what about that exhaust that okay I live in Shreveport exhaust it raw food is move down there with Christopher in Costa Rica exhaust it unless you're connected to
 it's not the gods your higher power to your saber
I won't be for filming in this world cuz this world is in our home
 the people that are on the path have more of a responsibility huge responsibility if we're actually compassionate yes if we're not compassion will just keep this to herself that's why they say that the someone like I'm going to the Power Pod so much compassion self realize being sitting and burned oven with the goal of life you can leave your body go right back to godhead or you get out of boat with $8 take a cargo ship come to New York hang out with a bunch of dirty hippies I mean who don't even bathe and you can cook them Cory's and gloves Germans and teach them the holy name and teach them to your time and in turn them into enlightened beings yeah it takes a lot of compassion to a little bit of a harder path
but it's also for a lot of us who were actually not liberated Souls but you know that is sort of like the end game for us that's what we want
 you get that way by giving it as well you get special blessings and you know you don't like this game Chutes and Ladders you get some ladders by giving it away and empowers you it gives you some you get some special Mercy by giving it away as well
 we think of soup
 Chipotle in Arthur
 please please do since we have a writer here
 remarkable writers couple letters of Margaret Mead who said do you know what she said we're gonna tell everybody about Krishna Consciousness before you die
you know she said Marina
 he said a lot of things because she she said never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
 and when it comes to to Bucky and the time that were in I think we're living in a very exciting time in history I wake up every morning feeling that you know that yes consumerism is a dark cloud it's like that's just like oh we can be a thundercloud but not for long and I Know It kind of it doesn't deliver it doesn't deliver and it's not just consumerism you know there's I suppose you could say there's all that this tied to it it it may be a you know if we say consumers in essentially we could
if we wanted to give like a more like what is the fundamental
 principle behind consumerism mutates greed probably you know as well as thinking about it to it it it it it is green but you can consume to have a type of refined thing and like when you come over to my house and so you see this refined thing you do yeah I mean who cares it's nothing but I feel like now I feel more special about my false identity because you appreciate it and not me it's like a vegetable escort with the creeper that if you don't mind I can help you out afterwards but you know that greed that is the you know the foundation consumerism you know Elise is so many other problems and leads to an ecologically Christ
it leads to war
 it leads to you don't like the extreme political polarity that we have now and social unrest in all these things lead to political instability and when the world starts to become unstable that's when people are ready to change their minds open up their minds to new ideas you know when the world stars went when they're stable when the world is stable and we think well I got what I need and everything is okay I'll let me just try to enjoy this world when that world gets turned upside down
 and you're like this world is not going to provide what I need I need some Foundation I need something more meaningful I need something that solid I've recognized that this world is a very in a varied is a very delicate situation to be in padam padam you'd be predominate a shinai that every step in this world is danger when you're feeling.
way
 then you begin to search deeper into life and so although these things
 sadness did you know that these these dark aspects of the world that we live in
 I think we can also as Buck to Yogi say this is kind of the groundwork
 this is kind of background that will make
 and more mass
 acceptance of the principles about the yoga popular or are you know what widespread and and I want to be clear that that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone becomes like a advice novel with my son of a t lock on and everything like that but
 you do people turn to religion
 historically to try to find meaning how to how to make
how to how to
 understand the meaning of life in this as we live through our life in this world and I think religion has let people down and it it religion has been corrupted in so many ways and and the essence that is there in in in so many of the Great world's religious Traditions it it's not flowing powerfully through them so well, I think the tradition of bhakti
 Krishna bhakti at as is as you know coming out of India and a sense has the power to wake people up to their to the essence of their own religions
 to set aside the external concerns of their religion and really understand the essence of it and threw that there can be a kind of unity
 and you know what went on when there's enough work
call Groundswell
 you know when there's enough Groundswell the world can change so it had in one good thing about this Zoomer society that we live in this Global society and in this world of ridiculous media and everything is that ideas can catch on quick and spread quick in this age and it just takes a few authors a few musicians a few speakers you know of a few public figures to really catch on to the essence of an intern a lot of people onto it so as the world gets darker
 we should understand that at any moment it can it is more prone to get lit up again and you could you could you could write something or you could write something that influences one person to another person and that person could influence a Maha influencer
 oh yeah
what we need to be now I'm with you I'm with you if that's a great attitude in a warrior you know they they go into battle and in and they may play a small part they may play large part one little soldier they play a huge role or it may take out a huge Army to 222 Chivas certain goal but what we do is we do our we do our part whatever it maybe we do our part in the Army must have faith that you know
 if you're in India right now it won't send Cindy is a mess it's like God the pollution there is just like off the charts it's like you know you're there and you're like this has to change something must be done and and of course has so many other two challenges there but it's also a place where Krishna Bucky and I want to be clear about this this always been there in India
but the real deep understanding of it and not just like the kind of like the quote on quote religious
 kind of
 external tradition that's always been there but you're really understand how Dynamic Krishna bhakti is how Dynamic it is in an individual's transformation and how Dynamic it is odd even on a social level how how powerful it can be that is something that I would say especially through Sheila Pro pods teachings and show prophets Grace is something that right now is like it's it's starting to take off in India it's it's like it's something that's very powerful it's something that's catching on and so I think a lot of Hope
 am I the one that froze or did Ragnar threes I froze okay so you missed everything that I just made my whole don't
buddy else heard it everybody else started out there on land just edges in a nutshell
 in India the tradition of body has been there forever but it may have been understood more than external religious level but by proposed books in his teachings and it going into the college has the top universities in India
 his teachings have been brought and there's thousands and thousands of young intelligent people coming out of the universities in India right now and going into high-level positions that really have a clear understanding of Bucky not just what it can do for the individual but its potential on the on the largest social or political level and so I think there's a lot of Hope for person Dynamic shifts in the world in the potty come player play an important of the important role in that
 good news I really love how you said
that actually because it is a dark time and the way you put that positive spin on that and the fact that we can have because it's true people have moved away from religion they need that sense of something so they go to politics or qanon or something so that if we can become those Warriors to bring that other option then then that's that's really beautiful that we're darkest before the dawn they say that Warriors of love
 why is there a Warriors of light Warriors of light and help you thank you very much Marina great to have you thank you both for being such Warriors it's the Love Guru
we've got ten minutes left we have any more questions who's next Ava Maria zoom and now directly from New Jersey wear hair to what they talk of t-shirt sweatshirt
 or is it a long sleeve t-shirt
 how to say you're right in the mic Ave Maria I've always heard for a long time not to point you're not the point your feet at
 not punch Pete at the altar and I believe that with me not to flex your feet so the bottoms of your feet don't Point towards the altar is that correct or lots of your feet or your toes like like
Marina ballerina feet or like walking feet so cuz like pointing your feet is your your foot is like this so your toes are on the on the floor boards
 Embrey if you don't have to give your whole bio but I'm not really sure I've always had a spiritual feeling in in man I've been looking for something I've gone to lots of different churches and whatever looking for trying to find what feels right and I'm not sure I think it might have been Instagram but I don't really know I forgot I stumbled upon it somehow I was cleaning my house one day I listen to podcast as I clean and I started listening to to you guys and there was one there was one thing something
about a wave and a surfer I was like one of your first podcast and that like that just like I think it was it was oh my gosh this is so real this is it and then I just got home I started listening to to all the all of them then I got the zoom link and started coming she's one of us winning the leg stuff towards the altar not just Cindy all of a lot of Asian cultures to to put out your legs to touch somebody with your foot is like a real no no
 is considered the low part of your body the part that
 you know what you know this is it this weekend maybe pull up Catherine question this point to her question was also kind of a detailed question like this right like when you're chanting japa on beads there's 108 beads and then there's one be this kind of like the scent Central bead from a ruby or the Google Keynote
she called it the group of her to call like the Krishna beater the radha-krishna be like if those 108 B's represent the 108th go pee so prominent gopis then that that last Bieber's represent route in Krishna and the whole thing becomes like the rest of dance and so you know speaking to that question these kind of questions they may sound like insignificant details in one sense they are not principles or details but there's a principle behind them that they're meant to serve and that has to do again with our sentiments were talking about this whole time about the Sanford I questioned you know that when you get trained in and Lenny's you get trained how to practice and the practice has so much to do with cultivating the right sentiments that make you receptive to receiving the potency of the holy name and so it's not the end of the world if you go over that bead it's not like the everything in the world is going to stop but the idea is just that
 well imagine if
imagine if Rob and Kristen were sitting at like the top of a circle and everyone and their 108 go pee sitting in a circle in front of them and you walked through the circle when you got to the end he would walk over at a time you turn around and walk the other way and I would say come back it just kind of way for a respected and you're always coming towards them in a sense you know you're not walking over then it's a simple thing like that end with the point in the fetus is a similar thing as Rush Rugrats mentioning it's it's less I think I remember hearing
 George Harrison mentioning when he first started getting trained in playing sitar by Ravi Shankar
 and inadvertently or on mindfully George stepped over his sitar right
 now he was immediately corrected by by rubbish long as you don't step over it like that you know you don't have is that going to affect
Kelly plays it in some sense Perhaps it is you know what it does in other words not that that act itself but your sentiment towards the instrument is what's important and how you cultivate that sentiment is he plays out in in the Attic it that you use and so as rugged as his mentioning it not just in India but I think all I have probably in the Middle East I think as well as other parts of Asia you know you defeat or either you don't wear your shoes in the house you know the feet are considered like look even when we bow down to the feed it's it's kind of seem like I show my respect even to to the lowest part of you and so we don't point that part at is in the western or we don't go to shake hands with the left hand
 you know someone does that it just feels like what you trying to say here is like like I'm not important or you don't really you're not you're not take
I seriously doubt that left-handed you put out the right-hand you do with the little you know with some respect so the point of the feet of something like that and I think you know generally there's a lot of sitting on the floor in these cultures and Sophie straight out your leg in the direction of the altar that would that would be considered in a sense disrespectful and assets not cultivate the sentiment that you would want to cultivate whether it's again it is not that the foot if it was like if you're standing in your toes are going in that direction that's not the thing but if you were to point the leg in the foot in that direction then that's that's what's a we're asked not to do I love your answer I love the George Harrison analogy is Ravi Shankar that there's much more refined sentiments to be cultivated
 besides just playing music here and
first of all we have descending information and the mood we approach God and Guru
 that affects what sort of the Sands and if it affects me as a receipt what we receive and I know that if if you've ever tried to tell a teenager something like hey make sure Saturday night people have got drunk on Saturday night if you're driving home and if I know you can't tell them anything
 so if you're still giving the same message but they're not receiving it in very cultured bhakti lineages they give you a sentiment a Consciousness to cultivate so you can receive more
 and that's what it is it's creating us to be a fine receivers sometimes I do with my teachers or my students go come with me will give me
hug but it's more like a whack on the back you know what I mean
 when your whack somebody on the back you don't whack your Guru on the back like that you know what I mean you'd like a friend on the back like that once you like the guru on the back it just seems like your buddies and but please don't give instructions generally they may give some unsolicited advice but if you know Ron has mommy says hey please sit down I will say I want to sit on the floor doesn't know you'll say please sit here and I prefer to sit on the floor if that's okay why because immediately creates a mood to receive like I'm not here to chat with you
 he's like well we're friends will none of you know you're being friendly
 I should never consider you my friend you're my Superior you're my teacher it's out of my arrogance and consider you my friend Krishna sent you to instruct me and I'm seeing you as that
I don't want to be your friends I want to be your servants if you want to be friendly to me that's your choice but I'm not going to see you like that and we created mine like that because once we do we cut off there's even something that's really tangible and I'll say it because you know I see back to Hootie who's assisting me in so many ways he will just bow down whenever he sees me and like to come on I can't keep going down like this I'm getting old town ain't easy but he'll come in Italy hug me like talking like he's a little baby and I just makes me want to give gift to the guy who makes me want to give him everything I have in and it because it's it's the mood he's cultivated and I didn't ask for but that's just what he does but if he was to just whack me on the back stuff like that I treat him like a buddy but when a person comes and they're really sort of have that mood of what can I do for you
you just want to take care of the guy you just want to take care of me when I nurture a muon instruct them and it and you set up a really beautiful relationship between teacher and student
 okay now she's going to get was that okay first time sorry so this is probably really important what is the story behind that what are the rules regulations who can wear the who should wear them how to wear them
 all of that please thank you
 tell City Beer did the Goddess Isis a goddess I've read so much about these people come up with different instructions that they've gone four different places and he wants sense
again it's either details
 generally I'm almost sure I can go find a quote that said anybody will benefit from wearing these beads and go ahead and wear them and then you'll find other
 more detailed instructions within particular lineages about how that lineage honors these particular beads who wears three strands and who should wear less than three strands and I think it's become the what's the way way to characterize it but it's become the accepted Norm within iskcon that initiated voters were three or more strands and if you're not in the shed you were less than that but I'm sure someone can pull out symbol it says here and there are about to relax this an attitude but but the central thing is there's one goddess in bring David Brenda Davey she's the goddess
Reverend David she's a the Goddess that provides the environment through which Radha and Krishna in the residence for diving enjoy the most beautiful sacred pastimes
 and she manifests in the form of the Tulsa tree to Tulsi plant in our in our lineage this is a very very celebrated aspect of of it in our lineage and so we we understand that tall see the leaves of tall see or very dear to Krishna
 and the beads from the Tallassee tree or are they there for their sacred and we wear them to honor her and to please him and also like as a
 I suppose you could say is a symbol that we are Christmas servant you know that the I wear these neck pain
it identifies music Christian servant so every anyone that wants to identify with Christmas servant we can do that and if someone else is wearing them and they don't fully identify that way they will also benefit from that one more detail though so I people always seem to wear them right right at the base of the neck is it okay to also just wear like one long yeah okay but we'll go outfit you after the after the podcast I'll be your stylist stylist part-time botanist and what was I today writer and author Kimbo Slice slicer and it was good to everybody
